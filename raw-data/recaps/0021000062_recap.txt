
 Jefferson's 3-pointers lead Spurs over Suns Posted Nov 04 2010 12:48AM PHOENIX (AP)  Richard Jefferson hit four fourth-quarter 3-pointers, including the go-ahead basket with 1:38 remaining, and the San Antonio Spurs edged the Phoenix Suns 112-110 Wednesday night. Jefferson finished with 28 points, Tim Duncan had 25 and Manu Ginobili added 18 for the Spurs, who won in Phoenix for the first time since Jan. 29, 2009. Jason Richardson scored 21 points, Hakim Warrick added 19 off the bench and Steve Nash also had 19 for the Suns, who have lost consecutive games for the first time since Jan. 25-26. Phoenix is 1-3 for the first time since 2006-07. Jefferson hit three straight 3-pointers from the left corner to give the Spurs a 103-97 lead with 6:15 to play. But after a free throw by Warrick, Nash sank a 10-footer, Warrick added a driving layup and Richardson hit consecutive baskets, the last off an alley-oop pass from Nash, to cap a 9-0 run that gave the Suns a 106-103 lead with 3:31 left. Antonio McDyess made two free throws to pull the Spurs within one before Jefferson hit his fourth 3-pointer from the same left corner to give San Antonio a 108-106 lead. The teams traded the lead 13 times in the first half before settling for a 50-all tie. San Antonio opened the game's largest lead early in the third quarter. Duncan's 17-footer just above the free throw line gave San Antonio a 67-56 advantage, but Phoenix slowly whittled the deficit to 81-79 on Richardson's two free throws with 23 seconds left. Notes: The Spurs beat Phoenix for the second time in eight meetings, including last spring's four-game sweep at the hands of the Suns in the Western Conference semifinals. Warrick recorded Phoenix's seventh double-digit scoring effort off the bench this season. Phoenix didn't have a double-digit scorer off the bench last season until its fourth game. The Suns said an article appearing in a local weekly newspaper that said Nash was going to retire to run for mayor of his native Victoria, British Columbia, was a hoax.
