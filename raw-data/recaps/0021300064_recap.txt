Celtics beat Jazz 97-87 for Stevens' first NBA win By JIMMY GOLEN Posted Nov 07 2013 1:50AM BOSTON (AP)  Brandon Bass scored 20 points and Jeff Green added 18 to lead Boston to its first win of the season, 97-87 over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. The game reunited new Celtics coach Brad Stevens with Gordon Hayward, the Butler star who took the Bulldogs to the NCAA championship game against Duke and just missed a shot from inside half court that would have won it. Hayward had 28 points and nine rebounds for Utah, one of the last two winless teams in the NBA this season. The attendance of 17,130 was about 1,500 fans short of a sellout, ending a streak of 289 games dating to the end of the 2006-07 season. That was the last game before the Celtics brought in Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen to join Paul Pierce for a New Big 3 that won the franchise's record 17th NBA championship.
