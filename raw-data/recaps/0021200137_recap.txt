DeJuan Blair added 19 points and Danny Green had 15 for San Antonio (8-2). Tony Parker and Tim Duncan each scored 14 points while playing 25 and 23 minutes, respectively.

The Spurs shot 54 percent from the field, including a 16-for-20 performance from 3-point range. San Antonio never trailed by less than 18 points in the second half.
