Nowitzki, Terry lead Mavs over Blazers in 2OT Posted Feb 12 2012 1:41AM DALLAS (AP)  Delonte West took Jason Kidd's advice, giving the Dallas Mavericks a badly needed late lift. West scored Dallas' first six points of the second overtime, and the Mavericks held on for a 97-94 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday night. Dirk Nowitzki's 20 points and Jason Terry's 19 led the Mavs, but West saved them when it mattered most. West started the second OT in place of Kidd after West played only 15 seconds in the first extra session. The Blazers were double-teaming Nowitzki, giving West more room to look for his shot. "J-Kidd told me to go out there and be aggressive because of the way they were playing Dirk," said West, who finished with 10 points. "I sparked my team right there in the second overtime." West hit an 11-footer for Dallas to open the second overtime. West followed with mid-range jumpers on consecutive possessions to give Dallas a 93-89 advantage with 2:55 left. "He was phenomenal," Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said of West. "The guy stays ready and he's a money player." Former Dallas-area high school star LaMarcus Aldridge had 33 points, and Jamal Crawford contributed 19 points for the Trail Blazers. Shawn Marion had 14 points and 12 rebounds for Dallas, which won its third in a row. Crawford hit two free throws and Aldridge made a 12-footer with 1:43 remaining in the second extra session to draw Portland even at 93. But Brendan Haywood's tip-in with 45 seconds remaining in the second overtime gave Dallas a 95-93 edge. Crawford missed from 15 feet, and Nowitzki swished a 15-foot fadeaway with 16.9 seconds left in the second OT despite Aldridge's tight defense for a 97-93 lead. "I do feel good about my defense," Aldridge said. "(Nowitzki) couldn't see the basket half the time." Wes Matthews made one of two free throws with 11.4 seconds remaining, Portland got the rebound of the second miss, but Crawford's desperation 26-footer failed to hit the rim as final buzzer sounded. Both teams were on the second leg of back-to-backs and wore down as the game wore on. Dallas won on Friday night at Minnesota 104-97, while Portland defeated New Orleans on the road 94-86. Portland's Nicolas Batum made a 20-footer from the corner to open the first overtime, and Crawford's layup with 3:42 left gave his team an 85-83 lead. Nowitzki made a 17-footer, Marion hit a layup with 1:08 remaining in the first overtime, and Marion converted two free throws with 37.3 seconds left to put Dallas in front 87-85. Aldridge rolled in an 11-foot jump-hook with 23.9 seconds left in the first overtime to tie it at 87, Nowitzki missed from 13 feet with 3 seconds left, and the game went to a second overtime. Portland rallied from an 18-point first-half deficit, with Aldridge scoring 15 fourth-quarter points. "I started out kind of slow," Aldridge said. "I was trying to get it going." Crawford's layup with 54 seconds remaining in regulation got Portland within 81-79, and Nowitzki's miss from 21 feet with 32 seconds left gave Portland a shot at tying the game. Aldridge's 15-foot turnaround with 12 seconds left in regulation drew Portland even at 81. The Blazers got off to a sluggish start, missing 12 of their first 17 field goal attempts as the Mavs surged to an 18-10 lead behind Nowitzki's eight points. The Mavs led at halftime, 43-32 on the strength of 18-of-36 shooting from the floor and 12 points from Nowitzki. At the break, Portland coach Nate McMillan stressed to his players the importance of a more physical second-half defensive effort. "We didn't do that in the first and I thought we scrapped and put up a fight the second half and fought our way back into the game," McMillan said.
