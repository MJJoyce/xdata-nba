Holiday, Sixers top Nets 102-86 Posted Nov 27 2010 11:42PM PHILADELPHIA(AP) Thaddeus Young had seen Philadelphia fall apart in the second half before. He wouldn't let it happen this time. Young sparked a fourth-quarter spurt to lead the Philadelphia 76ers past the New Jersey Nets 102-86 on Saturday night, snapping a three-game losing streak. The game featuring the Atlantic Division's bottom two teams was tied at 66 after three quarters, when Young reeled off seven straight points for Philadelphia, during a 10-2 run capped by Andre Iguodala's 3-pointer. Young finished with 13 points. "Anytime we can put together a fourth-quarter run like that, that's big," Young said. "We've had bad second halves all season. It usually starts in the third quarter and carries to the fourth. Today, we had that fourth-quarter push. We went out there and got the job done." Iguodala contributed 16 points and Lou Williams added 15 for the Sixers, who returned to Philadelphia after losing three straight on the road, including a 99-90 loss to the Miami Heat on Friday night. Saturday's win was their second in 10 games. Jrue Holiday had 20 points and 13 assists for the Sixers (4-13). "Our ace of spades tonight was Jrue Holliday," Sixers coach Doug Collins said. "He is growing every day, I can just see it." Brook Lopez led New Jersey with 25 points, Devin Harris added 19 and Kris Humphries pulled in 15 rebounds, but it wasn't enough to prevent the Nets from losing their fifth straight game on the road. "It was a tough loss for us," New Jersey coach Avery Johnson said. "They turned up the pressure on their defense. We couldn't score or defend in the fourth quarter, which has been a problem for us recently. They made shots." With Philadelphia leading 78-74, Lou Williams made a four-point play. He drilled a 3-pointer while being fouled by Lopez, then made the free throw for an eight-point lead. A 16-1 run by New Jersey helped the Nets to a 48-46 lead at the half. The Netz built that lead to seven early in the third quarter, but the Sixers went on a 12-2 run to retake the lead. NOTES: The Sixers swept the 2009-10 season series from the Nets, 4-0, after being swept the previous season. ... After winning four games away from home last season, New Jersey (5-11) won two of its first four on the road before losing five straight. New Jersey had an impressive 107-101 overtime win over Atlanta on Tuesday, then lost 89-83 at Boston the next night, managing only 37 second-half points.
