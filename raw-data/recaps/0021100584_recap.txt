Williams, Young lift 76ers past Jazz, 104-91 Posted Mar 10 2012 1:34AM PHILADELPHIA (AP)  The Philadelphia 76ers are getting healthy at the right time. Lou Williams and Thaddeus Young scored 21 points each, lifting the Philadelphia 76ers past the Utah Jazz 104-91 on Friday night. Evan Turner had 16 points and 12 rebounds, Jrue Holiday also scored 16 points, and Andre Iguodala added 10 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds for the Sixers, who followed Wednesday's 32-point victory over the Boston Celtics with another impressive performance. Young returned with a strong effort following a one-game absence with an upper respiratory illness. "The other day, I couldn't even get out of bed," said Young, who shot 8 for 17 and also had six rebounds. "Even (Thursday), I didn't feel all that well and was congested. I felt much better and had good energy out there." So did Turner, who was especially impressive in his third consecutive start. Two nights ago, he scored a career-high 26 points and added nine rebounds. Against the Jazz, he kept the momentum going with another steady floor game. "Evan is such a versatile player," forward Elton Brand said. "He's such a threat out there on the court." The Sixers got off to a 20-9 start thanks in large part to a deep bench. It had been depleted with a rash of injuries, but only center Spencer Hawes remains out with a strained left Achilles. Hawes is hoping to be back by the middle of next week. Philadelphia is 12-2 with Hawes in the lineup. "It means a lot," Brand said of being healthy. "It's good to have just about a full group back. You can see what it means." Paul Millsap had 15 points to lead the Jazz while Derrick Favors and Al Jefferson added 14 each. Gordon Hayward had 13 and Devin Harris 10 as Utah snapped a two-game winning streak. The Sixers led 78-68 after the third quarter and increased their advantage to 89-74 midway through the fourth. Holiday scored the Sixers' first seven points in the fourth and Williams took control from there with six points in the quarter. "This was one of the most complete games Lou has played," Sixers coach Doug Collins said. Utah never got closer than eight the rest of the way. "We've got to let this go," Millsap said. "We can't feel sorry for ourselves." The Jazz had climbed back to .500 by winning two of the first three on a five-game road trip that concludes Saturday at Chicago. Unlike the previous two games - a 109-99 win at Cleveland and a 99-93 victory at Charlotte - the Jazz could never get into an offensive rhythm against the Sixers. Utah shot 41 percent, including 3 for 11 from 3-point territory. "We didn't make any jump shots," Jazz coach Tyrone Corbin said. "They weren't falling." The Sixers shot 51 percent from the field in the first half and took a 49-47 lead at halftime. NOTES: Utah assistant coach Jeff Hornacek received a technical foul with 5:11 left in the third quarter. ... Sixers director of statistical information Harvey Pollack celebrated his 90th birthday and was honored by the team during the game. Pollack has been with the league since its inaugural 1946-47 season, and he wrote the "100" sign held by Wilt Chamberlain following his record-setting 100-point performance against the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962.
