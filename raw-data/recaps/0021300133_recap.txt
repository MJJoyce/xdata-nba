Parker leads Spurs past Jazz 91-82 By MATTHEW COLES Posted Nov 16 2013 2:21AM SALT LAKE CITY (AP)  Tony Parker scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter to rally the San Antonio Spurs to a 91-82 win over the Utah Jazz on Friday night. Boris Diaw scored a season-high 17 points and Tim Duncan added 14 to help the Spurs run their winning streak to seven in a game that matched the team with the best record in the Western Conference against the team with worst mark in the league. The Jazz took a 67-60 lead into the fourth quarter, but the Spurs started doing what they do best - driving the lane for layups or hitting the spot-up shooters in the short corners. Derrick Favors had 20 points and 18 rebounds for Utah, which led by as many 15 points early in the game. Gordon Hayward added 15 points and Richard Jefferson had 14.
