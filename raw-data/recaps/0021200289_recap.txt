Rudy Gay scored 17 points, but was 7 of 25 from the field. Mike Conley finished with 12 points. The game was close until the middle of the third quarter, when Atlanta erased a five-point deficit 20 unanswered points to build a lead that Memphis could not overcome.

Memphis carried a 47-41 into halftime behind Gasol and Randolph, who had 14 and 12 respectively, Randolph also grabbing nine rebounds. For the most part, the stats were close in the first half, the Memphis advantage coming from going 4 of 7 from outside the arc compared to the Hawks hitting 2 of 6. Memphis would hold an eight-point lead in the half, while the Hawks managed only a two-point advantage. Atlanta turned up the defensive pressure to open the second half, leading to a 10-4 run and a tie at 51. Memphis missed six of its eight shots in the early minutes of the third quarter and committed three turnovers to allow Atlanta to pull even. Atlanta would continue to push the pace, and the Grizzlies were dragging. The Hawks would craft a 20-0 run as Memphis went almost 5 minutes without scoring. The rally would put Atlanta up by 73-58, Williams connecting on three straight from beyond the arc. Williams would have 13 points in the third, helping the Hawks outscore Memphis 32-13 in the period, for a 73-60 lead entering the fourth.

Both times, Smith scored inside, the second time also drawing a foul. That was part of Smith scoring seven straight Atlanta points, and when Williams connected on his fourth 3-pointer of the night, the Hawks had stretched the lead back to double digits.
