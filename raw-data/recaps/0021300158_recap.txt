Heat win 4th straight, top Hawks 104-88 By TIM REYNOLDS Posted Nov 20 2013 2:17AM MIAMI (AP)  Chris Bosh scored 19 points, Mario Chalmers went on a personal 9-0 run in a 39-second spurt of the pivotal third quarter, and the Miami Heat topped the Atlanta Hawks 104-88 on Tuesday night for their fourth straight victory. Bosh shot 8 of 9 for the Heat, who got 17 points from Ray Allen and 13 from LeBron James. A 15-2 run in the third quarter gave Miami all the room it needed, even on a night when Dwyane Wade sat out to rest. Mike Scott scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for Atlanta, which got 12 points apiece from Al Horford and Pero Antic. Atlanta's Kyle Korver made three 3-pointers, extending his streak to 84 consecutive games with at least one make from beyond the arc, five shy of matching Dana Barros' NBA record.
