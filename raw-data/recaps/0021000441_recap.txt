Gay scores 30 points in Grizzlies' win Posted Dec 26 2010 11:10PM INDIANAPOLIS (AP)  The Memphis Grizzlies beat the Indiana Pacers inside and outside. Rudy Gay scored 30 points, Zach Randolph had 18 points and 16 rebounds and the Grizzlies snapped a three-game losing streak with a 104-90 victory over the Pacers Sunday night. "It might be mismatches," Gay said. "We have a dominant post presence. We make it tough for a lot of teams, not just Indiana." O.J. Mayo and Marc Gasol added 17 points each for Memphis. The Grizzlies improved to 5-11 on the road and 13-17 overall. "We have to have something to build on, and tonight was something we could build on," Gay said. "We got good shots and got our big men involved. It was one of those games where we can look back on it and say this is the blueprint." Danny Granger led the Pacers with 29 points and five rebounds. Roy Hibbert had 14 points and Mike Dunleavy added 10 for Indiana (13-15), which missed an opportunity to climb back to .500 and was denied its fourth set of back-to-back victories. The Pacers were coming off a 94-93 home victory over New Orleans on Monday night. "We just got outplayed," Indiana coach Jim O'Brien said. "I don't think we were sharp. You have games in the NBA season when you don't look sharp." Memphis has won five of its last six meetings with Indiana. Memphis led throughout the third quarter, pushing the advantage to 15. Indiana rallied in the fourth quarter, pulling to 88-80 on Granger's driving layup with 6:43 to play. Gay banked in a 17-footer from the top of the key on the next possession, and Memphis preserved the double-digit lead the rest of the way. Gay's 3-pointer that made it 100-86 with just less than 3 minutes left sent many of the fans streaming toward the exits. Hibbert shot 5 of 17 from the floor, including a stretch of seven straight missed attempts in the second quarter. The 7-foot-2 centere shot an improved 50 percent in the second half and scored 10 points. "A couple of weeks ago, I would have been down on myself," Hibbert said. "I'm just taking a different approach and just saying, 'You know what? It's going to eventually fall."' Memphis limited Indiana to 35 percent shooting and outscored the Pacers 44-30 in the paint.
