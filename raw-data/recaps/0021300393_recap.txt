Wizards erase 18-point deficit, top Celtics 106-99 By HOWARD ULMAN Posted Dec 21 2013 9:30PM BOSTON (AP)  The Washington Wizards didn't get flustered when they trailed by 18 points. The Boston Celtics couldn't hold a big lead for the second straight game. Trevor Ariza scored 27 points capped by a 3-pointer that highlighted a fourth-quarter run as the Wizards rallied for a 106-99 victory Saturday. "We don't let anything rattle us too much," Ariza said. "We just play and chip away and know things are going to happen. It's a long game. We know teams can go on runs. They went on a run and we did, too." After Jeff Green's layup with 6:14 left gave the Celtics a 92-84 lead, they went nearly six minutes without a field goal. Meanwhile, the Wizards were going on a 14-1 run that Ariza started with a jumper from the right corner. John Wall had five of his 20 points in the surge, which was interrupted only by a free throw by Jared Sullinger that gave Boston a 93-91 lead with 3:39 remaining. "It was just, `Ok. We fought back. Let's get some stops here and keep going. Keep stepping on them and let's runaway with this one,"' Ariza said. Nene tied it with a short baseline jumper and Wall gave the Wizards their first lead, 95-93, with a 20-footer with 2:51 to go. Marcin Gortat then blocked Sullinger's shot and Ariza hit his 3-pointer with 2:25 remaining to put Washington ahead 98-93. The Celtics had led 32-14 early in the second quarter. But in the last six minutes of the game, they were outscored 22-7, committed four turnovers and had two shots blocked. "They came out and punched us right in the face in the first quarter," Washington coach Randy Wittman said, "but I never saw any downness from our guys." Avery Bradley, an outstanding defender, scored 18 of his 26 points for Boston in a span of 8:01 in the second half. He started with a layup with 4:01 left in the third quarter that gave the Celtics a 66-59 lead and ended with a jumper with 8:00 left in the fourth that made it 88-82. Bradley then went to the bench and the Wizards began their comeback. "He had a good roll," Boston coach Brad Stevens said. "His effectiveness on the offensive end is just going to continue to improve." Washington (12-13) won its third straight game, all on the road.

But Washington tied it at 74 on a 3-pointer by Martell Webster with 42 seconds left in the third quarter. Then the Celtics took a two-point lead on Bradley's jumper from the top of the key with 3.9 seconds left in the period.
