Henderson leads Bobcats over Raptors 92-90 By STEVE REED Posted Nov 07 2013 1:49AM CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Gerald Henderson broke out of his shooting slump with a season-high 23 points, and the Charlotte Bobcats defeated the Toronto Raptors 92-90 Wednesday night. Henderson came in shooting just 31 percent through the first four games, but got off to a fast start and finished 10 of 17 from the field. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist scored 14 points for Charlotte. Second-year guard Jeffery Taylor continued to give the Bobcats quality minutes off the bench, scoring 13 points. Josh McRoberts added 13 points and five assists for the Bobcats (3-2), who have won two straight. Rudy Gay led the Raptors with 20 points. Jonas Valanciunas had 12 points and 10 rebounds. With the Raptors trailing 92-90 with 27 seconds left, DeMar DeRozan drove the lane but his shot was rejected by Bismack Biyombo. Toronto inexplicably didn't foul the Bobcats on their final possession and never got another shot off. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
