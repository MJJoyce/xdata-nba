Streaking Grizzlies beat Bobcats 94-87 Posted Nov 18 2012 12:34AM CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Mike Conley scored 20 points and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the Charlotte Bobcats 94-87 on Saturday night for their eighth consecutive victory. Zach Randolph added 18 points and 12 rebounds, and three other players scored in double figures for the Grizzlies, who own the NBA's best record at 8-1. Rudy Gay had 16 points and Marc Gasol and Tony Allen scored 12 apiece. Memphis led by as many as 17 points in the fourth quarter. Byron Mullens scored 18 points and Kemba Walker added 17 for the Bobcats, who cut the Grizzlies' lead to five points three times in the final period, the last at 92-87 on Bismack Biyombo's dunk with 13 seconds remaining. Charlotte had won three straight. Memphis, which ended the New York Knicks' undefeated run on Friday night, increased a nine-point halftime lead to 77-60 on Randolph's layup with 10:52 remaining in the fourth quarter. But Walker scored 11 consecutive points over the next 3 1/2 minutes to get the Bobcats back in the game. His layup with 6:54 left got Charlotte within six at 77-71. Despite their own shooting problems - 38.8 percent from the field - the Grizzlies ran the lead back out to double digits again, with Quincy Poindexter's layup with 2:39 left making it 88-77. But Ramon Sessions hit a pair of layups and rookie Michael Kidd-Gilchrist followed with a basket to cut Memphis' lead to 88-83 with 47 seconds remaining. Charlotte pulled within five points twice more in the final 30 seconds, but couldn't complete the comeback. Memphis opened a 47-31 lead on Allen's jumper with 1:02 left in the second quarter. The Bobcats then closed out the first half with a 7-0 run. Mullens had a three-point play, Ben Gordon drove for a layup off a steal and Walker hit a pair of free throws. Charlotte had a chance to extend the second-quarter run but Mullens missed a long 3-pointer off a steal at the buzzer. NOTES: Gordon returned after missing the last two games for what team officials said were "personal reasons." He was 4 for 10 from the field and finished with 10 points. He did not score in the final two quarters. ... F Hakim Warrick, acquired in a trade with New Orleans for G Matt Carroll, made his debut with the Bobcats. He came into the game late in the third quarter, and finished with five points and four rebounds in just under 10 minutes. ... The Grizzlies' win over Charlotte was their last road game for nearly two weeks. Memphis will play its next five games at home, beginning Monday against the Denver Nuggets.
