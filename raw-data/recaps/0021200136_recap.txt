Monta Ellis helps Bucks hold off Hornets, 117-113 Posted Nov 18 2012 12:37AM MILWAUKEE (AP)  Monta Ellis scored six of his 22 points in the final 2 minutes to help the Milwaukee Bucks hold off the New Orleans Hornets 117-113 on Saturday night. Brandon Jennings also had 22 points, and Mike Dunleavy added 17 for Milwaukee, 6-2 in its best start since opening 9-1 in 2001-02. Top overall draft pick Anthony Davis had a season-high 28 points and tied his season high with 11 rebounds for New Orleans. Ryan Anderson added 20 points for the Hornets. Davis had consecutive three-point plays to pull the Hornets to 110-108 with 2:02 to play, but Ellis hit a 20-footer falling away from the basket for Milwaukee. Anderson tipped in a miss for New Orleans, and Ellis hit another jumper for the Bucks. After Anderson missed a shot from in close, Milwaukee's Larry Sanders missed a layup, then made up for it when he blocked Anderson's driving shot. The Bucks controlled the ball, forcing Roger Mason to foul Jennings, who made one of two free throws for a 115-110 lead with 12.3 seconds to go. After a timeout, Anderson hit a tough 3 with 4.8 seconds left. Greivis Vasquez immediately fouled Ellis and he made both free throws to cap the scoring. The last chance for the Hornets came when Davis' inbound pass went across the court and off Mason's hands as time expired. Anderson's 3 gave the Hornets a 94-91 lead to start the fourth, but the Bucks answered with an 11-2 run sparked by two three-pointers from Beno Udrih and one from Jennings for a 102-96 lead with 8:12 to play.
