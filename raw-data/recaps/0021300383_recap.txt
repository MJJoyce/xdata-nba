Turner hits OT winner, 76ers tops Nets 121-120 By DAN GELSTON Posted Dec 20 2013 11:05PM PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Evan Turner tossed up a high, arching shot and then watched the ball bounce around the rim, almost in slow motion. "It felt like 150 times," Turner said. Try three. Turner's final shot took some hops before it dropped through the net for the winner at the buzzer, and he scored 29 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 121-120, overtime win over the Brooklyn Nets on Friday night. "I got a lucky couple of rolls," Turner said. "The basketball gods looked out for me." Paul Pierce, playing like his All-Star days in Boston, had put the Nets up 120-119 on a 3-pointer with 16.9 seconds to go in OT for the short-lived lead. Turner took a dribble-handoff from Spencer Hawes at the top of the key, and turned the corner to his left past Shaun Livingston. He drove into the low post and shot the one-hander over Pierce and Brook Lopez. Once, twice, three times the ball knocked around the rim before the Sixers could celebrate. After a brief review, the bucket stood, Turner was mobbed by his teammates and the Sixers snapped a seven-game losing streak. "We needed to get that win for the sanity of the group, keeping our group together, holding hope," coach Brett Brown said, "and for those reasons as that ball is hanging on a rim and then decides to fall in, for us, given where we are, that is an important win." Turner was sensational all game, hitting his first eight shots (13 of 22 overall) and he had 10 rebounds for his sixth double-double this season. Thaddeus Young scored 25 points for the Sixers, and Michael Carter-Williams had 15 points and 10 assists. Alan Anderson had a season-high 26 points for the Nets, Pierce scored 24 with 10 rebounds, and Deron Williams had 17 points and 14 assists. Brooklyn grabbed a 115-113 lead early in OT after Turner and Pierce swapped 3-pointers. Carter-Williams hit two free throws for a 116-115 lead, then had the assist to Young in front of Brooklyn's bench on a 3-pointer with 2:02 left. The 76ers missed three shots on the same possession, setting up Pierce's clutch 3, Brooklyn's 15th of the game. Turned out, the Sixers had one last dramatic shot of their own. Turner's 13th basket of the game was his biggest of the season, and he was mobbed on the court by a Sixers team buried well below .500. "I was just thinking of my reaction if it didn't go in, who I was going to punch," Turner said. Carter-Williams returned after a seven-game absence because of a skin infection and teamed with Tony Wroten in the backcourt for an effective 1-2 combination. Wroten scored 19 points. Thanks to OT, the Sixers finished with season highs in field goals (51) and assists (36). Mirza Teletovic hit 6 3s and scored 18 points for the Nets. Lopez had 22 points. The Nets played without veterans Joe Johnson (personal reasons) and Kevin Garnett (rest). "We're bottom feeders, just like Philadelphia," Pierce said. "We've got to be up for everybody." Without their veterans, the Nets missed twice on one of the final possessions of regulation and the Sixers grabbed the rebound. Brown called timeout with 21.1 seconds left, setting up Carter-Williams' drive down the lane. He beat Williams to the basket, but ended with a wild misfire on a left-handed layup over Lopez. Brooklyn grabbed the rebound and called timeout. Williams missed at the horn over Young's outstretched arm to send it into OT. Neither team could break away in the fourth. Young hit a mid-range jumper from the top of the key with 1:58 left for a 107-106 lead. Anderson snatched it right back on two free throws - a lopsided edge for the Nets. The Nets made 21 of 30 free throws; the 76ers just 10 of 15. Turner hit only the front end on a pair of attempts, but tied the game 108-all. Anderson, who averages only 8.0 points, connected on a pair of 3s during a 10-1 run late in the third that sent the Nets into the fourth with an 83-82 lead. Johnson made 10 3-pointers, most in the NBA this season, and scored a season-high 37 points in the Nets' 130-94 victory over the Sixers on Monday night. "We didn't come out the same way we did on Monday," Nets coach Jason Kidd. "We felt we scored (130) points and thought it was going to happen again. We started to play defense with a minute left and got the stops. But we didn't get the stop we needed and they made a shot." With Johnson out, Teletovic took over as Brooklyn's 3-point ace, hitting five in the first half against one of the worst-defending teams in the league. He nearly did as much damage alone from 3-point range as the Sixers did as a team. NOTES: There were 31 lead changes and 21 ties. ... The Sixers are 4-1 in OT this season. ...
