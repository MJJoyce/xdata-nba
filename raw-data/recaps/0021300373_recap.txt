Jennings carries Pistons past Celtics 107-106 By KEN POWTAK Posted Dec 18 2013 11:18PM BOSTON (AP)  The Detroit Pistons have been known for their inside scoring this season. Brandon Jennings made sure teams realize they're dangerous from the outside, too. Jennings scored 28 points, making a key 3-pointer with 46.7 seconds left, and matched his season high with 14 assists Wednesday night and the Pistons held on for a 107-106 win over the Boston Celtics. It was one of Jennings' five 3-pointers in the game. The Pistons, who entered the game leading the NBA in points in the paint per game with 51.6, went 10 for 27 from beyond the arc. It started with Jennings, who went 9 of 21 from the floor. "He made plays," Pistons coach Maurice Cheeks said. "If it wasn't for him, he made it for other players like (Greg) Monroe and had plays down low." Jennings said the confidence his coach has in him made a big difference when he was taking key shots. "He tells me to go be great with five minutes to go in the game, so that's what I'm trying to do," he said. Andre Drummond scored 14 points with 16 rebounds and Josh Smith added 20 points for the Pistons, who won for the seventh time in 11 games. It was the Pistons' sixth road win in their past seven. Detroit trailed by 21 points in the first half after giving up 42 points in the opening quarter. It was the most given up in a quarter by the Pistons and Boston's season high. "I thought our second half was obviously better than our first half," Cheeks said. "The first quarter, number one, our energy level was low. We picked our energy up and got back in the game." Jared Sullinger scored 19 points, Jordan Crawford had 17, Avery Bradley 14 and Jeff Green 13 for Boston, which lost for just the third time in nine games. "It's easy for all of us, myself included, to be really focused on `We had a 19-point lead and didn't win the game', but we got outplayed for 36 minutes," Boston coach Brad Stevens said. Green missed a driving one-hander wildly just before the horn sounded. He said it was the play that Stevens drew up. "Yeah, but not very shot falls," he said. "Josh made a good attempt, trying to block it. I redirected my shot and kind of missed it." The Pistons held a seven-point lead after Smith's basket with 2:56 to play before Boston scored the next eight points, with Sullinger's 3-pointer from the top capping the spree with 61 seconds left. Jennings then made a 3-pointer over Bradley 14 seconds later. On Boston's next possession, Sullinger was fouled, hit the first free throw, but missed the second and Boston trailed 107-106 with 41.5 seconds left. Jennings missed a long jumper and Drummond failed to convert the put-back attempt and Sullinger grabbed the rebound, setting up Boston's final shot. Neither team held more than a one-possession lead in the opening six minutes of the fourth quarter until Drummond's hook in the lane gave the Pistons a 96-91 lead with 5:46 to play. Smith then had the next three Pistons' baskets, trading scores with Boston as the Pistons maintained between a four and seven-point edge. Detroit had taken the lead 92-89 on Jennings' shot-clock beating 3 from the right wing with 6:49 left. The Pistons used an 11-0 run early in the second half, slicing an 11-point halftime deficit to one before Jennings made a 3-pointer and was fouled on the shot by Bradley. He hit the free throw, giving them their first lead of the game 74-73 with 5:01 left in the third. After shooting 61.5 percent (24 of 39) in the first half, Boston hit just seven of 24 attempts (29.2) in the third as the Pistons closed it to 81-80 after three. The Celtics held a 63-52 halftime edge. Boston, which led by 19 after one quarter, pushed it to 52-32 on Kelly Olynyk's layup before the Pistons scored 14 of the next 18 points to slice it to 56-46. Greg Monroe scored three straight baskets during the run. The Celtics shot 69.6 percent (16 of 23) and led 42-23 after one quarter, ending the quarter on Gerald Wallace's well-placed alley-oop feed to Sullinger at the buzzer. With 0.2 seconds left in the quarter, Detroit's Kyle Singler was called for traveling in front of Boston's bench. Wallace inbounded the ball just past the rim to Sullinger, who tipped it in as the horn sounded. Boston led 26-20 before closing the quarter by scoring 16 of the final 19 points. Bradley had a pair of 3s and scored eight in the spree. Detroit, which entered the game leading the league in points in the paint, was outscored 18-8 in the lane during the opening quarter.
