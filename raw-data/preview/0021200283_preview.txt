Warriors-Wizards Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Dec 08 2012 12:01AM Stephen Curry and David Lee have made sure the Golden State Warriors' season-high seven-game road trip is off to a solid start. They don't appear to be slowing down, either. Golden State looks to pick up its third straight win on this road swing as it visits the NBA-worst Washington Wizards on Saturday night. The Warriors (12-7) got off to a disappointing 3-4 start but they've won nine of 12 since, including the first two of their journey comprised exclusively of Eastern Conference opponents. Curry scored 22 points and added 10 assists while Lee finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds in a 104-97 win over Detroit on Wednesday to start the trip. They shined again in Friday's 109-102 victory at Brooklyn, as Curry netted 28 points with Lee scoring 30 and adding 15 boards. Though Curry's four-game streak of 20-point, 10-assist games ended against the Nets, he's averaging 22.5 points and 8.8 assists as Golden State has won five of six. "He's a bad man," coach Mark Jackson said. "At the end of the day, he's healthy, and I'll take him matching up against any point guard in this league. And that's with total respect for ... other guys in this league, but Steph Curry is in that class and he shoots the ball as well as anybody that's ever played. "For the first time in a long time he's healthy, and I think people forgot just how good he is." Lee is averaging 22.2 points and 10.7 rebounds over the last six games, shooting 59.3 percent. "We take a lot of pride in going on the road and finding a way to get wins," Lee said, "We were very, very happy we did that." Lee has been solid in his last 10 games against the Wizards, averaging 21.9 points with 12.4 rebounds. He'll look to help guide the Warriors to a fourth straight win over Washington, which has split its last four games after opening 0-12. The Wizards (2-14) shocked defending champion Miami 105-101 at home Tuesday, but they couldn't carry over that momentum Friday in a 104-95 loss at Atlanta. Kevin Seraphin came off the bench but played a team-high of 32 minutes, leading Washington with 19 points on 9 of 16 shooting. He finished with seven rebounds after having a double-double in each of his previous three games. "We had the time. We had the chance," Seraphin said. "We should have executed more." Washington was outrebounded 47-32 and gave up 22 second-chance points. "We didn't trust again," coach Randy Wittman.  "We quit running and moving the ball, started holding and dribbling and didn't trust what we were doing." Rookie Bradley Beal was the only starter in double figures with 18 points. "We got back to the old Wizards instead of the team that we know we can be," Beal said. Curry played less than 10 minutes because of a foot injury but scored 12 points while Lee added 13 and 10 rebounds in 120-100 road victory over the Wizards in the most recent matchup March 5. These teams have split the last 12 meetings in Washington. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
