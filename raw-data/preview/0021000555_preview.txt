Pacers-76ers Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Jan 10 2011 6:59PM While the Philadelphia 76ers have struggled for victories on the road this season, winning at home has been a lot easier. That trend might continue with the Indiana Pacers visiting the Wells Fargo Center, especially if Andre Iguodala returns from injury. The 76ers will attempt to win their third straight at home by sending the Pacers to a 10th consecutive road defeat Tuesday night. Philadelphia's 112-109 overtime loss to Detroit on Saturday night was its third straight away from home and 16th in 21 road games this season. However, the 76ers (15-22) now play three straight at home, where they've won nine of 11. They'll also get to open that stay with a matchup against the Pacers (14-20), losers in 10 of 13. Philadelphia might get Iguodala back from a sore Achilles' tendon for this game after he missed the last seven. Should he return Tuesday, it will be to an improved offensive team. The 76ers have averaged 103.5 points over their last six games after averaging 87.3 in their previous six. Point guard Jrue Holiday isn't concerned about incorporating Iguodala, the team's third-leading scorer (14.2 ppg), into the offense. "We're definitely starting to feel each other right now and we have a lot of confidence," he said. "(Andre) is definitely one of the players who knows how to go with the flow." Iguodala's replacement in the starting lineup, Andres Nocioni, has averaged 12.3 points in his last six games - nearly double the 6.8 per game he was contributing before that stretch. Holiday has averaged 20.1 points over the last eight games, and No. 2 overall draft pick Evan Turner has chipped in a couple of strong performances. Turner had a team-best 19 points Saturday and scored a career-high 23 in a win at Phoenix on Dec. 29 after averaging 6.3 points in his first 29 games. Turner had one of his better early season performances at home against the Pacers on Nov. 3, scoring 12 points in a 101-75 rout. Elton Brand led the way with 25 points and 12 rebounds. Indiana shot what remains a season-worst 31.5 percent in that meeting while having its three-game win streak over Philadelphia snapped. Danny Granger missed 12 of 14 shots while scoring a season-low seven points - the only time he hasn't had at least 20 in his last five games versus the 76ers. The Pacers' leading scorer had 22 points in a 99-86 home win over the 76ers on Oct. 30. Granger failed to top 16 points for the second consecutive game Saturday night as Indiana tied a season high with its third straight defeat overall, 108-93 to Atlanta. That was the Pacers' ninth consecutive road loss, dating to a win at Sacramento on Nov. 30, and five of the last six were decided by double digits. They last dropped 10 straight road games Jan. 9-Feb. 18, 2009. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
