Bobcats-Thunder Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Mar 10 2012 2:06AM The Oklahoma City Thunder saw their 14-game home winning streak come to an end their last time out. They probably like their chances of starting a new streak against their next opponent. The Thunder will try to avoid back-to-back losses for only the second time this season Saturday night when they host the league-worst Charlotte Bobcats. Oklahoma City is leading the Western Conference and vying for the NBA's best record in large part due to its success at home. The Thunder (31-9) suffered their first home loss since Jan. 3 with a 96-90 defeat to Cleveland on Friday, dropping them to 17-2 on their own court. After overcoming a 16-point deficit to beat Phoenix 115-104 on Wednesday, Oklahoma City came up short Friday. The Thunder led 85-82 with 3:14 to go, but didn't hit another field goal until 24.2 seconds left. Russell Westbrook scored 19 points - his fewest in six games - while Kevin Durant scored five of his 23 points in the final 40 seconds. While Durant is averaging 28.0 points, he's been held below that mark in two of the last three games. "We've got to be more aggressive," said Durant, who had a season-high eight assists and six turnovers. "I know I've got to be more aggressive in trying to score the ball. Tonight I was trying to force the pass too much." Durant has been plenty aggressive against Charlotte in the past, averaging 28.3 points the last four meetings. Being aggressive on the boards would also benefit the Thunder, who have been outrebounded in each of the last two games, including 51-40 by the Cavaliers. Oklahoma City gave up 21 offensive boards Friday after allowing 16 to Phoenix. "We've done a good job of bouncing back (this season)," James Harden said. "So tomorrow should be better." The Thunder will get another chance to defeat a sub-.500 opponent when they face the lowly Bobcats (5-33), who are coming off an 83-74 loss to New Jersey on Friday. Charlotte shot 34.9 percent and went 2 of 11 from 3-point range, scoring fewer than 75 points for the second time in five games. Corey Maggette had 19 points and seven rebounds while Bismack Biyombo added 11 and 11. Maggette has been a bright spot lately, averaging 24.3 points and 7.0 rebounds the last four games. The Bobcats continue to look for ways to spark the struggling team. On Friday, that included coach Paul Silas allowing assistant coach - and son - Stephen Silas to run the game. "I just wanted to give Steven a shot at coaching a team that I felt we could compete with," Paul Silas said. "I thought he did as good of a job as I had done. We just didn't get it done for some odd reason." After completing a 1-3 homestand, Charlotte heads on the road for four games. The Bobcats have dropped 18 of 20 on the road overall in 2011-12 and 13 straight away games against Western Conference opponents dating to last season. They've averaged 78.4 points and been outscored by 25.0 in five losses to West teams this season. Oklahoma City has won two in a row against Charlotte and is 6-1 all-time against the Bobcats at home.
