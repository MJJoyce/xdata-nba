Thunder-Magic Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Mar 01 2012 12:13AM There's only one NBA city where the Oklahoma City Thunder haven't won since the franchise relocated in 2008. All-Stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook will try to end the team's road woes in Orlando after both played a key role in a victory there last weekend. The NBA-best Thunder will try to match a season high with a seventh consecutive win Thursday night when they go for the franchise's first road victory over the Magic since 2004. The Thunder (28-7) have won 24 of 34 on the road against Eastern Conference opponents following Wednesday's 92-88 victory over Atlantic Division-leading Philadelphia, but getting the job done in Orlando could be tough given Oklahoma City's recent struggles there. The Thunder franchise hasn't won a game visiting the Magic since March 13, 2004, when the team was based in Seattle. The SuperSonics dropped their last four in Orlando and the Thunder haven't been any better, losing by an average of 15.3 points in their three visits. Durant scored 23 points on 7-of-22 shooting in Oklahoma City's last game at the Magic, a 111-88 defeat Feb. 25, 2011. The two-time defending scoring champion is averaging 15.3 points - his worst mark on the road against any team - in four career games in Orlando. Durant, though, looked right at home in Sunday's All-Star game in Orlando, hitting 14 of 25 shots and scoring 36 points to earn MVP honors in the Western Conference's 152-149 victory. Westbrook was 10 for 17 from the field and chipped in with 21 points off the bench. Durant and Westbrook combined for 45 points Wednesday but shot 14 of 38 as Oklahoma City made 38.5 percent of its field-goal attempts. However, the Thunder were outstanding on the defensive end, giving up one field goal and four points in the final 5:32. Oklahoma City is allowing 95.8 points per game on 41.2 percent shooting during its winning streak. "We defend," said coach Scott Brooks, whose team outrebounded the 76ers by 17. "That's one thing we are consistent with. We just have to keep doing it." The Thunder will try to equal a season-best 7-0 run set Jan. 6-16 as they continue their three-game trip. Orlando (23-13) returns to Amway Center after capping a 3-2 stretch away from home with Wednesday's 102-95 victory over Washington. The Magic blew a 17-point first-quarter lead but hit 15 of 36 shots from 3-point range to hold on for their 11th victory in 15 games. "That's what we do - we can really stretch the court and obviously when we have Dwight (Howard) get double-teamed and attract so much attention, that really leaves us open," said Ryan Anderson, who hit four 3s and scored 23 points to lead seven Magic players in double figures. Anderson, the NBA leader with 103 3-pointers made and 238 attempted, went 6 for 12 from long range and recorded a team-high 25 points in a 97-89 season-opening loss at Oklahoma City on Christmas Day. Durant scored 30 to lead the Thunder. Howard, who had 11 points and 15 rebounds in that meeting, will try to extend his season-high run of double-doubles to eight after scoring 14 points with 12 boards against the Wizards. Howard grabbed 15 rebounds and finished with a season high-tying 40 points in the Thunder's last visit. The Magic are trying to win four in a row in Orlando for the first time since taking their first four home games of the season. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
