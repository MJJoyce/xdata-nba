Kings-Hawks Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Dec 17 2013 11:58PM The Atlanta Hawks could use some consistency. Kyle Korver is certainly doing his part, and their upcoming schedule should also help. Korver looks to continue his record-setting streak from 3-point range as the Hawks try to beat the Sacramento Kings for a 12th straight time Wednesday night. Atlanta (13-12) has won four of six after dropping five of six. Despite continuing to hover around .500, the Hawks are getting consistent production from Korver, who is averaging 12.3 points and is among the league's top 3-point shooters at 48.7 percent. Korver's knack for connecting from long range has reached historic levels, as he's hit at least one 3 in an NBA-record 94 straight games since going 0 for 2 at home against Houston in his first game with Atlanta on Nov. 2, 2012. Korver kept his string going Monday, hitting three 3s to spur a dominant third quarter as Atlanta went on to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers 114-100 in the opener of a three-game homestand. He scored all 11 of his points in the period, when the Hawks outscored the Lakers 35-19. "Great intensity. Great aggressiveness and I think we played off of our defense," first-year coach Mike Budenholzer said. "We moved the ball well. We found the open guy. That's how we want to play." That hasn't been a problem against the last-place Kings (7-16). The Hawks are averaging 111.0 points during their win streak in the series while making 50.7 percent of their shots, including 39.8 from beyond the arc. After facing Sacramento, Atlanta hosts Utah (6-21) on Friday. Korver has put together his own streak against the Kings, making at least one 3 in six straight meetings while going 18 for 26 from long range and averaging 13.8 points. Al Horford had 27 points and 10 rebounds and Paul Millsap added 25 and 11 in a 105-100 win at Sacramento on Nov. 5. Horford is averaging 23.5 points and 9.3 boards over his past four meetings with Sacramento. The Kings have dropped three of four and are coming off one of their worst performances of the season. They shot 37.5 percent from the floor - 4 of 15 from 3-point range - while falling 95-87 at Charlotte on Tuesday. DeMarcus Cousins scored 30 points and pulled down 17 rebounds with six assists and three steals. The center is averaging 24.5 points and 13.3 boards over the past six games. However, he was limited to 11 points with six rebounds against the Hawks last month. Rudy Gay is looking for a bounce-back performance after scoring a season-low four points while missing 5 of 6 shots against the Bobcats. He totaled 50 points in his first two games with the Kings after being acquired in a seven-player trade with Toronto on Dec. 9. Gay may have to contend with the Hawks' DeMarre Carroll, who was a big reason Kobe Bryant was limited to eight points on 4 for 14 from the floor Monday. "I love it," Carroll said. "That's what they brought me here to do, play defense. Each year I'm trying to make the defensive team because I think I can be one of the lock-down defenders."
