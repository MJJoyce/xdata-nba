Pacers-Bulls Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 29 2011 12:25PM An ailing Derrick Rose couldn't slow down the Chicago Bulls at home. The Indiana Pacers seem unlikely to, either. The Bulls seek their 13 win in 14 home games overall and sixth straight home victory over the Pacers on Saturday night. Despite having difficulty eating and drinking due to two stomach ulcers, Rose had 22 points and 12 assists Friday to lead Chicago (32-14) to a 99-90 victory over Orlando on Friday night. "You want to be great, you have to fight through the pain," said Rose, who will be the Bulls' first All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1998. "It's mind move matter. It was hard." Rose, who missed seven of his first eight shots before finishing 6 of 21 from the field, earned high praise from coach Tom Thibodeau for his gutsy effort. "It's amazing, the way he plays," Thibodeau said. "And he plays so hard. He's taking hits all the time, but the thing I respect about him is he always gets up." Rose scored 29 points in a 99-86 victory at Indiana on Jan. 14. He is averaging 24.1 points in his last seven games against the Pacers (17-26). Chicago, which has taken five of six from the Pacers overall, has outscored Indiana by an average of 11.4 points during its five-game home winning streak in the series. Indiana routed New Jersey 124-92 at home Friday night, shooting 62.5 percent overall and 54.5 percent from 3-point range. "It was no fun losing six in a row," said Mike Dunleavy, who made 6 of 7 from beyond the arc and led all scorers with 30 points. "We know that we can win, we know that we have to come out strong, move the ball, play 'D' and find a way to win...I think (Friday night) is the beginning and we just need to work, work, work." The Pacers figure to have a much tougher time scoring against a Bulls defense allowing an NBA-low 89.4 points per game at home. Chicago is 21-1 at home when allowing less than 100. Indiana, meanwhile has dropped 13 of 14 and four in a row on the road. Roy Hibbert had 20 points for the Pacers in Friday's win while Danny Granger added 18. "I was just trying to pass up shots just so I could get Roy going," said Granger, averaging 27.0 points over his last six meetings with Chicago. "We really focused on getting him going because he's so important to what we try to do here." Hibbert is averaging 6.7 points on 23.1-percent shooting in his last three games against the Bulls, including a 1-of-8 performance which resulted in a season low-tying two points in the Jan. 14 loss. Indiana could be without Tyler Hansbrough (pneumonia) and Brandon Rush (sprained right ankle) on Saturday. Both players missed Friday night's game and their status is uncertain. The Pacers last defeated Chicago away from home 108-101 on March 22, 2008 - the season before the Bulls drafted Rose No. 1 overall. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
