Suns-Timberwolves Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Jan 08 2014 2:31AM Kevin Love is the biggest reason why the Minnesota Timberwolves are one of the highest scoring teams in the NBA, and looking to build on one of their most impressive performances of the season. The Phoenix Suns would like to bounce back from one of their worst. Love and the Timberwolves attempt to move above .500 with another outstanding shooting display Wednesday night against the visiting Suns. Love's 26.4 points per game and 13.3 rebounds rank second in the league in each category. The star forward's tremendous season has helped Minnesota (17-17) average 107.4 points, also second-highest in the NBA. The Timberwolves have flexed those offensive muscles during a 4-2 run, averaging 116.0 points while shooting 48.2 percent from the field and 40.8 percent from beyond the arc. They hit a season-high 16 3-pointers on 26 attempts en route to a 126-95 win at Philadelphia on Monday. "Just a really solid win for us," coach Rick Adelman said. "We came out at the start of the game and played well all the way through. We did a pretty good job of keeping them in the half court and passed the ball and shot the ball well." Love certainly did that against the 76ers, scoring 26 points while making 4 of 7 from long range. He's averaging 30.1 points and connecting on 43.7 percent from behind the arc in 14 games since missing one to be with his family following the death of his grandmother. Love averages 24.5 points and 14.3 rebounds in six career meetings with Phoenix, thought he missed the last three due to a broken hand. Ricky Rubio picked up the scoring slack in the latest meeting April 13. The guard had a career-high 24 points, 10 assists and five rebounds and as many steals in a 105-93 win at Target Center. Like the Timberwolves, the Suns (20-13) are among the most potent offensive teams, averaging 103.2 points. They didn't come close to being that productive in Tuesday's 92-87 loss at Chicago in the opener of this five-game road trip. Phoenix missed 17 of 23 from 3-point range against the Bulls after making 12 of 27 in a 116-100 win over Milwaukee three days earlier. Goran Dragic leads the Suns with 18.9 points per game, and he's been even better of late. The guard is averaging 23.2 and shooting 53.1 percent from the field - 8 of 19 from long range - over the past five contests, scoring 21 on Tuesday. Dragic, though, has struggled against the Timberwolves, averaging 9.1 points in 15 career meetings. He was held to 10 points on 4 for 11 from the field, but had 14 assists in April. Markieff Morris had 20 points and nine boards in that matchup. The reserve forward may be looking forward to another visit to Minnesota after scoring six points on 2-for-9 shooting at Chicago. It's unclear if the Suns will have guard Eric Bledsoe available. He's missed three straight games with a sprained right knee, leaving Phoenix without one of its top scorers at 18.0 points per game.
