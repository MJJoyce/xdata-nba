The Memphis Grizzlies, however, hope that's the case as they look to build off their latest win while trying to avoid a sixth consecutive home loss to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. Rudy Gay hit a fadeaway jumper over LeBron James at the buzzer to help Memphis (5-9) snap a five-game skid with a 97-95 home win Saturday over a Miami Heat team without an injured Dwyane Wade. Zach Randolph had 21 points with 13 rebounds, Mike Conley added 16 points and Gay 15 with eight rebounds as Memphis put forth the kind of spirited effort coach Lionel Hollins had hoped would be a regular occurrence for his team this season. "This was the most unified we've been," Hollins said. "That's how you win tough, close games, everybody rooting for each other, everybody picking each other up." Though it was their third win 11 contests, the Grizzlies hope an emotional victory over a potential championship contender could provide enough of a spark to help the club get out of its early rut. "We put ourselves in the situation where any win can be big for us," Gay told the Grizzlies' official website. For the moment, the Grizzlies hope it's enough to begin a run at home. After going 23-18 at home last season, Memphis is 3-4 at the FedEx Forum. The Grizzlies are 1-8 at home against Detroit since the franchise moved from Vancouver. That victory came Dec. 11, 2004. The Pistons (5-9), however, fell to 2-6 on the road after an 88-84 loss at Dallas on Tuesday. Gay averages a team-leading 21.9 points on the season, but 15.8 in four home games versus Detroit. Randolph, averaging 18.6 points and 12.6 boards since missing four games with a back injury, had 24 with 13 rebounds in a 99-93 win at Detroit in the teams' most recent contest Jan. 27. Richard Hamilton has averaged 19.8 points on 50.3-percent shooting in nine games at Memphis, but 9.3 while shooting 32.9 percent on the road this season. He was held to five points on 1-of-7 shooting at Dallas. Tayshaun Prince and Rodney Stuckey each had 19 points, but Detroit shot 42.5 percent and was held to fewer than 90 points for the fourth time this season - three of which have come on the road. Despite an overall poor shooting effort, Detroit led by five after three quarters. "This is a tough loss because we controlled the game pretty much throughout," Prince said The Pistons have averaged 98.8 points during their five-game winning streak at Memphis.
