Spurs-Clippers Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Dec 01 2010 2:19AM The San Antonio Spurs are off to the best road start in franchise history, and a matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers gives them a great chance to extend that mark. The NBA-leading Spurs go for their 10th straight victory at Los Angeles and their 19th in a row overall in this matchup series on Wednesday night when the teams conclude their season series. San Antonio (15-2) improved to 8-0 on the road for the first time with Tuesday's 118-98 victory over Golden State. Leading scorer Manu Ginobili had 27 points and Tim Duncan recorded his first regular-season triple-double since March 14, 2003, against the Clippers by scoring 15 with 18 rebounds and a career high-tying 11 assists. His last triple-double came in Game 5 of the 2008 Western Conference finals against the Los Angeles Lakers "I couldn't make a shot so I figured I'd pass it and let somebody else make a shot," said Duncan, who missed 9 of 15 shots on Tuesday. "I wasn't trying to do it. Just the flow of the game and the plays that were being called." Duncan and the Spurs, winners of 14 of 15, are seeking their third victory over the Clippers (3-15) in 2010-11, and fifth straight season sweep of this matchup. After posting a 97-88 victory at Los Angeles on Nov. 1, the Spurs won their 18th straight over the Clippers, 107-95 in San Antonio on Nov. 10 behind 22 points apiece from Ginobili and Richard Jefferson. Los Angeles was without Chris Kaman (sprained left ankle), Baron Davis (sore left knee) and Eric Gordon (shoulder) in that matchup, and it will likely be working with a short bench again. Kaman is likely to miss his 11th straight game, while Davis remains day-to-day after sitting the last 10. Without two of its top players, coach Vinny Del Negro's team has leaned heavily on Gordon, who is averaging a career-best 24.3 points, and rookie Blake Griffin, one of three players averaging more than 20 points and 11 rebounds. "My teammates have done a good job of getting me the ball ... when I don't have something, I know I can kick it out," Griffin said after posting his fifth straight double-double with 35 points with 14 rebounds and seven assists in Sunday's 109-97 loss to Utah. Griffin has scored 28 points and grabbed 16 boards in the two games versus San Antonio. While Gordon and Griffin have carried the team on the offensive end, the Clippers remain one of the league's worst defensive squads, giving up 105.1 points per game on 48.1 percent shooting. "We have to do a better job defensively, no question," Del Negro, who played for San Antonio from 1992-98 said. "Since Day 1, that's been one of our talking points ... We just have to keep working at it to give ourselves more of a chance." Slowing down Ginobili, though, could be a tall order for Gordon and rookie point guard Eric Bledsoe. Ginobili is scoring 26.4 points per game - 4.5 more than his season average - in the last five, hitting 51.3 percent from the floor during that stretch. Ginobili averaged 18.0 points on 52.6 percent shooting in the two victories against the Clippers last month. Los Angeles' last win versus San Antonio was 98-85 at home on March 7, 2006.
