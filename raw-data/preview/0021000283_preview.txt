Timberwolves-Spurs Preview By MATT BECKER Posted Dec 02 2010 1:09PM The San Antonio Spurs not only own the NBA's best record but also have a 13-game winning streak over the Minnesota Timberwolves, owners of the second-worst mark in the league. Despite all that, the Spurs probably won't take the Timberwolves lightly considering what happened the last time they met. San Antonio tries to bounce back from a defeat to the NBA's worst team when it hosts Minnesota, which is seeking its first win at the AT&T Center in nearly seven years, on Friday night. The Spurs (15-3) went into Wednesday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers riding an 18-game winning streak in the series, but fell 90-85. San Antonio's starters had a season-low 46 points on 37.8 percent shooting, with Tim Duncan scoring eight on 2 of 8 from the floor and Tony Parker finishing with two points on 1-of-6 shooting. "We played badly, bottom line," said Duncan, who recorded a triple-double in a 20-point road victory over Golden State one night earlier. The Spurs lost for just the second time in 16 games and fell to the Clippers for the first time since March 7, 2006. "It's the NBA, and anybody can beat anybody at any time," San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. The Spurs hope to avoid a similar fate against a Timberwolves team it hasn't lost to since a 103-101 overtime defeat Jan. 3, 2007. San Antonio had a close call in Minnesota last Wednesday, however, falling behind by 21 before rallying to win 113-109 in overtime. Manu Ginobili scored 14 of his 26 in the fourth quarter for the Spurs, who didn't take their first lead until 49 seconds remained in the extra period. San Antonio hopes things go a bit easier at the AT&T Center, where it won both games against Minnesota last season by an average of 20.0 points. The Spurs, who open a six-game homestand and play nine of their next 10 in San Antonio, have won 12 straight at home over the Timberwolves since Jan. 14, 2004. San Antonio isn't the only city that has given Minnesota trouble. The Timberwolves are 1-9 on the road and have one win in their last 22 games away from the Target Center. Minnesota (4-14) arrives in San Antonio following a 100-86 loss at Dallas on Wednesday, its fifth straight defeat. Michael Beasley had a team-high 16 points for the Timberwolves, who shot 39.0 percent from the floor and turned the ball over 17 times. Turnovers have been an ongoing problem for Minnesota, which is averaging a league-worst 17.8. "We turned the ball over way too much," coach Kurt Rambis said. "And guys got discouraged. Even when it got into the 10-point range in the third quarter, our guys still had their heads down, that was a little bit of a disappointment. So, the guys are young, they've got to get to the point where they do little things that turn the game in their favor." Kevin Love, the league's top rebounder, struggled a bit against the Mavericks with 12 points on 3-of-10 shooting and 15 boards. The forward had averaged 25.7 points and 20.3 boards in his previous three games, including a 32-point, 22-rebound effort against the Spurs. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
