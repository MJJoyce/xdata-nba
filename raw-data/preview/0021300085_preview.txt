Jazz-Raptors Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Nov 09 2013 12:55AM Although they're the NBA's lone winless team, the Utah Jazz might be able to end the franchise's worst start in 39 years given their history against the Toronto Raptors. The reeling Jazz hope to finally end to their season-opening drought as they seek their eighth straight win in Toronto on Saturday night. Coming off a season-worst 97-73 loss at Chicago on Friday, not much is going right for Utah (0-6) during its worst start since losing the first 11 games of its inaugural 1974-75 season in New Orleans. The Jazz were outscored 56-22 in the paint and limited to 29.4 percent from the field - their worst shooting performance since Nov. 14, 2005. With last year's leading scorers Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap gone, Utah continues to scuffle offensively, averaging an NBA-low 87.2 points on 39.4 shooting. The Jazz also are the league's worst 3-point shooting team, going 27 for 109 (24.8 percent). Gordon Hayward and Enes Kanter entered Friday's action averaging 19.0 and 18.6 points, respectively, but they shot a combined 9 for 26 from the field against the Bulls. "(We're) frustrated, frustrated," Hayward said. "(We've) got to find some way to get the job done. We just got to get through this real rough patch we're going through. If you can't score the basketball, it just puts too much pressure on your defense." That hasn't been much of an issue, however, when they've played the Raptors (2-4). Utah has scored 109.3 per game and made 49.4 percent from the floor while winning 14 of 15 in this series. The Jazz totaled 271 points and shot 27 of 49 from beyond the arc to win both meetings last season, though they needed three overtimes to win 140-133 in Toronto on Nov. 12, 2012. Marvin Williams had 17 points on 6-of-9 shooting in that contest, and he's expected to make his season debut after missing the first six games due to an Achilles injury. In the most recent meeting with Toronto on Dec. 7, 2012, Williams had 14, Hayward added 17 and Kanter finished with 18 points and eight rebounds in a 131-99 home victory. The Raptors also hope to end their slide after dropping their third straight by falling 91-84 at unbeaten Indiana on Friday. They led 32-22 after one quarter but managed just 52 points over the final 36 minutes against the defensive-minded Pacers. Toronto hasn't been able to get its offense in gear, averaging 92.3 points on 42.8 percent shooting. DeMar DeRozan entered Friday averaging a team-high 19.2 points but finished with a season-low six while missing 13 of 15 attempts. He's scored 16 or more in his last five games against the Jazz, and matched a career high with 37 to go along with eight rebounds and six assists in last year's triple-overtime game. "It's tough on the whole team when DeMar struggles," teammate Rudy Gay said. "I have to figure out how we can make us both comfortable at the same time." Gay had a season-high 30 points by making 12 of 26 shots against Indiana, but went 3 of 13 after halftime. He's averaged 19.0 points despite shooting 35.1 percent from the field over his last five games. Gay has scored 20.3 per game in his last six against the Jazz - all while he was with Memphis.
