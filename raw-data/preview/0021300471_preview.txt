76ers-Nuggets Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Dec 31 2013 12:58PM A season after finishing with the NBA's best home record, the Denver Nuggets haven't been able to stop the bleeding there during their current skid. Perhaps they'll be able to turn things around against one of the league's worst road teams. Denver looks to end its longest losing streak in 11 years while the Philadelphia 76ers try to build on their first win away from home in almost two months Wednesday night. The Nuggets (14-16) finished a franchise-best 38-3 in Denver in 2012-13, including 23 straight wins to close out the regular season. That kind of home dominance, however, has eluded the slumping club this season. Denver, 7-7 at the Pepsi Center, has dropped four straight there and seven in a row overall following a 97-94 loss to Miami on Monday. The losing streak is the Nuggets' longest since dropping the final eight games in 2002-03. "I think we're starting to get it," forward Darrell Arthur said. "We're trying to turn this thing around. Obviously, we're on a seven-game losing streak but hopefully we can turn this thing around and get back over .500." After averaging 102.0 points and shooting 37.8 percent from 3-point range in the first 10 games on its own court, Denver has struggled to find a rhythm with 91.8 points per game on 29.0 percent shooting from beyond the arc during the home skid. Ty Lawson, averaging a team-best 17.8 points, was a bright spot with 26 and seven assists Monday. He made 5 of 8 from 3-point range while the rest of the team shot 3 for 12. Since scoring 12.1 per game on 35.2 percent shooting over a seven-game stretch, Lawson has totaled 46 points on 16-of-29 shooting in the last two. With Lawson out due to a hamstring injury, Nate Robinson stepped up with 20 points to lead Denver to a 103-92 win in Philadelphia on Dec. 7. Tony Wroten had 20 points for the 76ers (9-21) while filling in for starter Michael Carter-Williams, who was sidelined with right knee soreness. Carter-Williams has averaged 18.5 points, 8.3 assists and 3.0 steals in four contests since returning from a seven-game absence. He scored 13 on Sunday to help last-place Philadelphia snap a 13-game road losing streak with a 111-104 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Evan Turner, averaging a team-high 19.4 points, scored 22 after missing one game due to a sore right knee. Thaddeus Young paced the effort with 25 points and Spencer Hawes added 19 as the 76ers snagged their first road win since Nov. 1 and sixth overall in 27 games. "We've been playing hard all season long," Young said. "Our record doesn't say we're going out there and doing the job, but we're working to get better every time." Young certainly has been on a roll, averaging 27.5 points while hitting 11 of 17 from 3-point range over the last four games. In the most recent meeting in Denver, Young had 18 points and Hawes added 17 and 12 rebounds in a 101-100 loss March 21. While the 76ers have scored 109.8 points per game in their last four, they're allowing a league-high 111.5 on the season - including 120.7 over the last six. Philadelphia has lost three of four meetings. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
