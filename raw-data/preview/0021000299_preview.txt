Grizzlies-Nuggets Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Dec 04 2010 6:54PM The Denver Nuggets continue to find ways to win games. A visit from the Memphis Grizzlies isn't likely to put an end to their string of victories. While looking to increase its longest winning streak of the season, Denver will try to extend its domination of the Grizzlies on Sunday night. The Nuggets (12-6), winners of six consecutive games, have taken 23 of the previous 24 home meetings with the Grizzlies, outscoring them by 11.4 points per game. In Friday night's 109-104 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, Carmelo Anthony led the way with 26 points - 13 of which came from the free-throw line. Denver, which is averaging an NBA-best 111.7 points at home, connected on just 40.3 percent from the field, its lowest mark at Pepsi Center in 2010-11. The Nuggets were still able to improve to a Western Conference-best 9-1 at home, thanks largely to 59 free-throw attempts - an NBA high this season. "Ugly, man. Ugly game, ugly win," said Anthony, who is averaging 32.6 points in his last five games versus the Grizzlies. Nuggets coach George Karl, who is seventh all-time and fourth among active coaches with 998 victories, said before the game he hopes to sign a contract extension with the team in the near future. "The further you get into the season, the contract situation is going to be discussed," said Karl, who has undergone treatments for throat and neck cancer this year. "Hopefully we can keep winning and keep that off the discussion plate. My concern the last six months has been on me and my health and it still is." On the court, J.R. Smith has started to catch fire. Smith averaged 8.5 points during his first 13 games, but he has put up 23.7 over his last three contests while hitting 11 of 22 from 3-point range. Smith has averaged 28.0 points while connecting on 13 of 25 from beyond the arc in his last two meetings with Memphis. Denver received a bit of bad news in the win Friday, as Chris Andersen, who missed the first 13 games of the season while recovering from knee surgery, fell awkwardly and was forced to leave with a bruised lower back after compiling a season-high six blocks. His status is uncertain. "I knew I was tipping over, so I tried to brace, but it's not like falling when you're 21," the 32-year-old Andersen told the Nuggets' official website. "I'm the Bird, not a cat." On Friday night, Memphis (8-12) fell to 1-9 when allowing at least 100 points as it surrendered its highest point total of the season in a 127-111 loss to Houston. "Did we have one?" Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins said when asked about his team's defensive effort. "I don't think we even had one. We gave up 127 points. We scored 111 points, enough to win a game. But when you can't stop the other team at any point in the game, you don't have a chance." Rudy Gay, who put up 29 points, leads the team in scoring with 21.6 per game but has averaged 11.6 points in seven career contests in Denver. O.J. Mayo was limited to three points Friday, but may bounce back against the Nuggets. He has averaged 22.0 points against Denver, including a career-high 40 in a 133-123 road loss Nov. 1, 2009. Memphis is averaging 97.3 points while going 2-7 on the road, compared to 104.5 on its home court. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
