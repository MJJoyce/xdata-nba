The Jazz will try for their 11th straight win over the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night. Utah has won five in a row and is 11-3 against the Raptors at home, and its star point guard has never lost to them in 10 career games. Williams was second on the Jazz with 18.7 points per game last season but finished with 13 and shot 3 for 12 as Utah fell 110-94 to Phoenix in its home debut Thursday. He averaged 19.6 points in Utah last year and is looking to bounce back after shooting 35.3 percent in the first three games. Utah (1-2) defeated Oklahoma City 120-99 on Sunday night as it avoided its first 0-3 start since 1979-80. Paul Millsap broke out in a big way, recording a game-high 30 points on 12-of-19 shooting while grabbing 16 rebounds. Williams scored 16 and dished out 15 assists. "It was big for us, for our confidence, just to get a win in the W column," Williams said. "It says a lot about this team that we can bounce back after the first two games, not really putting up much effort." Al Jefferson, who was acquired in the offseason to replace two-time All Star Carlos Boozer, put together his second straight 20-point effort by scoring 23 while also notching 10 rebounds. "We watched a lot of film after the second loss and I saw a lot of things that I was missing in the offense, a lot of passes that I missed, a lot of chances that I missed," he said. "This new offense for me, it's getting better and better by the day." The Raptors will be making their second stop on a four-game trip as they try to get over a disappointing loss. Toronto (1-2) led by as many as 16 in the third quarter but couldn't stop a furious comeback as it fell 111-108 to Sacramento on Monday night. Andrea Bargnani led the way with 28 points as he continues to be the focal point of the offense on a revamped roster. DeMar DeRozan, who matched a career high with 24 points, knows Toronto is going to have to play better down the stretch. "We just need to figure it out and be better with our execution," he said. Reggie Evans pulled down 19 rebounds as he improved his average to 16.3. He could be in line for another big total against the Jazz, who are allowing 42.7 boards per game. The Raptors' last win in Utah was 104-95 on Nov. 10, 2004. Not a single player remains from that team. The Jazz finished 32-9 at home last season, tied for the third-most wins in the Western Conference. Utah hasn't lost its first two home games since 2001-02.
