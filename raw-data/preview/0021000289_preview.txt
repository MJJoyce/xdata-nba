Bobcats-76ers Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Dec 04 2010 12:57AM The Charlotte Bobcats overcame a horrendous fourth-quarter performance in their last game. The Philadelphia 76ers were not as fortunate following their own late meltdown. Looking for their first consecutive wins in more than three weeks, the Bobcats go for their fourth straight victory over the 76ers on Saturday night in Philadelphia. Leading by seven with 1:23 left in regulation Friday, the Bobcats (7-12) needed overtime to defeat New Jersey 91-84 at home. Back from a one-game suspension for berating officials in a 104-101 loss at Milwaukee last Saturday, Stephen Jackson scored a team-high 25 and hit four free throws in the final minute of overtime to help Charlotte avoid a season high-tying third straight defeat. "It's still hard for me. I'm not going to change overnight," Jackson said. "But I know what I have to do to in order to do the right thing for my teammates and the fans and that's just play basketball." Bobcats coach Larry Brown will take the win - the 1,096th of his career - but the 70-year-old Hall of Famer was not thrilled to watch two teams shoot a combined 33.9 percent with 36 turnovers, 22 coming from his squad. "You know, they're selling Dr. Naismith's rules coming up," said Brown, whose team had dropped six of nine. "I think he'd be a little suspect in thinking this was the game he invented." Leading his team to Philadelphia, where he coached from 1997-2003, Brown will try to help the Bobcats snap a four-game road losing streak. The Eastern Conference-worst 76ers (5-14) were well on their way to a season-high third straight victory Friday in Atlanta, but coach Doug Collins' team made just one field goal in the final 8:45 and was outscored 21-3 to end a 93-88 loss. "We just couldn't get a basket," Collins said after the 76ers were held scoreless for the final 2:18. "That's been my concern the whole year long, that in a close game we couldn't find a basket. "I think we get tight. I think there's that feeling that 'I don't want to make a mistake." While the 76ers have dropped eight straight on the road, they will try to win their fourth in a row at Wells Fargo Center to open a four-game homestand. Philadelphia's last 4-0 stretch at home was March 11-25, 2009. The 76ers trailed by as many as 29 points in the Bobcats' last visit, a 102-87 Charlotte victory March 10. Gerald Wallace led the Bobcats with 28 points in that matchup, while Jackson added 24 with 10 rebounds. Philadelphia second-year guard Jodie Meeks will likely be matched up with Jackson after making his first career start Friday in place of No. 2 overall pick Evan Turner. "He knows this is not a demotion," Collins said of Turner, averaging 4.8 points in the six games Andre Iguodala has been back following an Achilles' tendon injury. 76ers leading scorer Elton Brand, who had 16 points and a season-high 14 boards Friday, averaged 15.0 and 10.0 last season as these teams split two matchups in Philadelphia. Charlotte has won six of eight versus the 76ers overall since Brown took over in 2008-09. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
