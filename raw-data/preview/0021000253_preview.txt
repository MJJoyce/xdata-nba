Bucks-Jazz Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Nov 29 2010 1:46AM The Utah Jazz are on a roll thanks to Deron Williams and strong scoring depth. A visit from the potentially short-handed Milwaukee Bucks may not provide much of an obstacle. Williams looks to help the Jazz extend their winning streak to six by continuing their home domination of the Bucks on Monday night. Utah (13-5) has won 13 of 16 after opening the season with consecutive lopsided losses. The current five-game winning streak is the second of this extended hot streak. The Jazz, who have held opponents to an average of 91.4 points during their last five victories, last won six in a row in a nine-game run Jan. 20-Feb. 9. Williams, the team leader with 21.9 points and 9.9 assists per game, has been a major spark of late. The All-Star guard is shooting 58.7 percent over the last three games while averaging 27.0 points and 10.7 assists. He connected on 8 of 14 shots Sunday, finishing with 26 points to lead six Jazz players in double figures during a 109-97 road win over the Los Angeles Clippers. "Our guys have played pretty well together and our bench has given us a tremendous lift to put us in a position to be able to win a lot of those games," coach Jerry Sloan said. "Those guys have given us a great deal of life to fight back, and it's been fun." The Jazz are now looking for a strong start to their season-high six-game homestand, and facing Milwaukee (6-10) might be an ideal way to accomplish that. They've won eight straight home meetings with the Bucks, holding them to an average of 89.1 points since a loss Oct. 30, 2001. Utah kept that winning streak going with a 112-95 victory Jan. 16, and the Bucks will likely need another big performance from Brandon Jennings to end it. Jennings helped Milwaukee overcome four key absences by scoring a season-high 32 points in a 104-101 home win over Charlotte on Saturday, halting a five-game slide. The Bucks have stumbled to a 2-6 mark on the road. Jennings wasn't very effective in Milwaukee's last visit to Utah. The guard made 1 of 8 shots and finished with five points. He scored 23 in a 95-87 win in Milwaukee on March 12. The Bucks may need to rely on Jennings heavily if Andrew Bogut (back spasms), Drew Gooden (plantar fasciitis), Corey Maggette (left ankle soreness) and Carlos Delfino (neck strain and concussion) continue to be out with injuries. Playing without Bogut and Gooden again would leave Milwaukee without its top rebounders at 10.9 and 7.5 per game, respectively. That would create favorable matchups for the Jazz, who will likely start forward Paul Millsap and center Al Jefferson. The duo combined for 25 points Sunday against the Clippers. Millsap is averaging 18.9 points and 8.5 boards, while Jefferson is producing 16.5 points and a team-high 8.6 rebounds per game. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
