Kings-Bobcats Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Apr 21 2012 1:22PM The Sacramento Kings are in danger of finishing with the worst record in the Western Conference. The Charlotte Bobcats could end up with the worst in league history. Charlotte's franchise-record losing streak would reach 20 games Sunday night if visiting Sacramento ends a six-game skid in this series. Considering they haven't lost to the Kings since Feb. 22, 2008 - and Sacramento is tied for the West's worst record - this may be the Bobcats' best chance to avoid a dubious distinction. Charlotte (7-55) needs to record a victory in one of its final four games to avoid the worst winning percentage in NBA history. That mark is currently held by the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers, who finished 9-73 for a .110 winning percentage. "Everyone knows what we're playing for," Gerald Henderson said Friday after matching a career high with 32 points in an 85-80 loss to Memphis. "We don't want to set that record." While the Bobcats have lost a team-record 19 in a row overall, Sacramento (20-43) has dropped nine of 10. Charlotte has the league's worst home record at 4-27, and the Kings' 5-26 road mark is ahead of only the Bobcats. Since defeating Portland 104-103 last Sunday to end a seven-game skid, Sacramento has lost two in a row to the West's top teams, San Antonio and Oklahoma City. The Kings fell into a tie with New Orleans in the conference basement following Friday's 103-92 loss to the Thunder. With its final two games against Oklahoma City and the Los Angeles Lakers, Sacramento might need to win Sunday to give itself a chance to finish outside the conference cellar. However, the Kings are 1-6 all-time in Charlotte. The Bobcats have dropped 12 straight at home since defeating Toronto 107-103 on March 17 - their last victory in any arena. They actually had a good chance to win their latest game but were outscored 28-15 in the fourth quarter Friday against the Grizzlies. "We gave it away," Henderson said. The Kings have been doing a better job lately of not giving the ball away, averaging 10.0 turnovers over the last three games, but they continue to struggle on the defensive end. Their last eight opponents are scoring 109.5 points per game on 50.5 percent shooting. Sacramento might have to lean more on Isaiah Thomas, Tyreke Evans and DeMarcus Cousins on the offensive end if Marcus Thornton misses a second consecutive game with a left quad contusion. Thornton has averaged 20.3 points in his last 15 games. Henderson, averaging 23.5 points over his past four, scored 10 of his 21 in the fourth quarter of the teams' most recent meeting as Charlotte won 110-98 on Feb. 25, 2011.
