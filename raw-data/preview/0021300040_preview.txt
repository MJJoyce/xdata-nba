Kings-Warriors Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Nov 02 2013 2:19AM The Golden State Warriors have a variety of scoring options, though their ability to hold onto the ball may raise some doubts about their success moving forward. They'll look to cut down on the turnovers Saturday night against the visiting Sacramento Kings, who have consistently contained Stephen Curry in recent meetings. Golden State (1-1) ran away with a 125-94 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, overcoming 15 turnovers behind a career-high 38 points from Klay Thompson. But 25 giveaways did the Warriors in Thursday in a 126-115 loss to the Clippers despite 38 points from Curry, who scored only 10 in the opener. Thompson finished with 10 points, and coach Mark Jackson was asked why he took only seven shots after going 15 for 19 from the field in the opener. "We're not running our offense through Klay. That's not who we are," Jackson said. "We pick and choose, find the hot hand, we run our offense and we execute. (Wednesday) he had it going and we made a steady diet of Klay. (Thursday) we were trying to find a rhythm and then Steph got it going." Curry hit 14 of 23 shots, including 9 of 14 from 3-point range, and added nine assists. However, Curry's 11 turnovers were tied for the fourth-highest in a single game since they became an official statistic in 1977-78, and they marked the most since New York's Amare Stoudemire also had 11 against Washington on Dec. 10, 2010. "It's disappointing for me to let my shooting performance be overshadowed by my 11 turnovers," Curry said. "But it's not going to keep me down." Curry's recent play against the Kings hasn't exactly been stellar. He had 17 points and 12 assists but shot only 5 of 18 from the field in a 105-98 loss March 27 in the last matchup. He's averaging 14.7 points and shooting 30.3 percent in his last six versus Sacramento, which is coming off a 110-101 loss to the Clippers on Friday. DeMarcus Cousins had his second straight solid performance for the Kings (1-1), scoring 24 points and adding 10 rebounds after finishing with 30 and 14 in Wednesday's 90-88 win over Denver. Cousins, though, also picked up a technical foul in the fourth quarter. "We have to get better on the defensive end," he said. "They got going, and instead of us stopping the bleeding we let them continue to do that. They didn't beat us. We beat ourselves." Isaiah Thomas, who scored 31 points in the last meeting with Golden State, finished with 29 off the bench. Greivis Vasquez, acquired in an offseason trade from New Orleans, has started at point guard in both games, though Thomas, who started 62 games last season, played nearly 11 more minutes than Vasquez on Friday. "I love the fact that we got back in the game and we didn't stop competing," coach Michael Malone said. "But you can't beat a good team if you allow them to shoot 50 percent from the field and from the 3-point line." The Kings have won three of the last four meetings with the Warriors.
