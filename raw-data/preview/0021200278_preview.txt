Rockets-Spurs Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Dec 07 2012 12:41AM Fine or no fine, Gregg Popovich isn't likely to change his philosophy on resting starters throughout the season. So far, the San Antonio Spurs' bench has been ready to answer the coach's call. The Spurs, though, won't get a break in the schedule Friday night when they host the Houston Rockets, losers of five straight on the road. San Antonio's reserves nearly led the team to a win at Miami on Nov. 29 after Popovich sent four starters home to rest before the nationally televised contest. Popovich, whose team was later fined $250,000 for his action, went to his bench out of necessity on Wednesday night. With Danny Green (hamstring), Stephen Jackson (finger), Kawhi Leonard (knee) and Patty Mills (ankle) out because of injuries, the Spurs displayed their depth again in a 110-99 victory over Milwaukee. Gary Neal started in place of Green and scored 22 points, Tiago Splitter finished with 15, Manu Ginobili had 11 and Matt Bonner added a season-high 12 rebounds off the bench. Even with Neal moving into the starting lineup, San Antonio's bench had 40 points, 25 rebounds and 13 assists, and fueled a late 36-13 run that keyed the team's seventh win in eight games. The Spurs (15-4) rank near the top of the Western Conference in bench scoring at 39.8 points per game. They'll continue to need a complete team effort with this contest starting a stretch of three games in four nights. "They're talented," said Tony Parker, who led the starters with 22 points. "They showed it in Miami and they showed it again. Pop is always trying to do stuff to make sure our bench is performing." Tim Duncan, who had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Bonner led an impressive performance on the boards. San Antonio outrebounded Milwaukee 53-36, including 28-17 in the second half. The Spurs hope to match that effort against the Rockets (9-8), who rank near the top of the NBA in rebounding (45.2 per game). Omer Asik ranks third in the league with 12.1 per contest. The Rockets also received a boost from their bench on Tuesday night. Toney Douglas scored a season-high 22 points, Greg Smith added a career-best 21 and Carlos Delfino had 15 in a 107-105 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. "We had a lot of guys struggle, but our bench was good," said interim coach Kelvin Sampson. "There is a lot to be said about having guys on the bench that you trust that can come through." James Harden, the team leader with 23.6 points per game, will try to break out of a 13 for 51 (25.5 percent) shooting slump over his last three games. After averaging 23.0 points in his previous three games, Patrick Patterson is also looking to get back on track after a six-point effort on Tuesday. Houston shot just 37.6 percent from the field - including 7 of 34 (20.6 percent) from beyond the arc - against the Lakers after shooting 50.3 percent in its previous four games. While the Rockets have averaged 111.7 points in winning five of six, all five of those victories have come at home. They're just 2-5 on the road and haven't won there since the second game of the season. Houston, which split the four-game series with the Spurs last season, will try to avoid a sixth straight loss in San Antonio. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
