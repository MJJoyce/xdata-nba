76ers-Bucks Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Dec 21 2013 12:33AM The Philadelphia 76ers have struggled mightily since beating the Milwaukee Bucks last month but managed to snap their longest losing streak of the season their last time out. The 76ers next try to end an 11-game road skid in Saturday night's rematch with the lowly and short-handed Bucks. Philadelphia is 2-11 since a 115-107 overtime victory over visiting Milwaukee on Nov. 22. It edged Brooklyn 121-120 on Friday on Evan Turner's buzzer-beating layup in another extra period. "I got a lucky couple of rolls," Turner said. "The basketball gods looked out for me." Turner scored 29 points after totaling 12 on 4-of-18 shooting in his previous two games, and Thaddeus Young added 25 as the 76ers snapped a seven-game skid. Philadelphia (8-19) has needed overtime to earn each of its last four wins. Michael Carter-Williams had 15 points and 10 rebounds after missing the last seven games because of a skin infection and a sore right knee "We needed to get that win for the sanity of the group, keeping our group together, holding hope," coach Brett Brown said, "and for those reasons as that ball is hanging on a rim and then decides to fall in, for us, given where we are, that is an important win." Turner scored a team-best 27 points and Spencer Hawes had 25 against Milwaukee last month. They also played a big role in a season-best 57.0 percent shooting performance for Philadelphia by making a combined 21 of 34 attempts. The 76ers haven't won on the road since their first game away from Philadelphia on Nov. 1 against Washington. Their 11-game road skid is their longest since last season's 15-gamer Jan. 2-March 21, which included two defeats at the Bradley Center. The 76ers have dropped five of six games in Milwaukee, but the Bucks (5-21) enter with the NBA's worst record and losers of five straight after a 114-111 overtime defeat in Cleveland on Friday. John Henson scored six of his 18 points in the final 3:45 of regulation but the Bucks gave up the tying score in the final seconds and couldn't recover after falling behind early in the extra period. O.J. Mayo scored a team-leading 20 points despite missing 15 of 21 shots, and Brandon Knight had 17 points, a career-high 14 rebounds and eight assists. Caron Butler missed his 12th consecutive game because of a sore right knee but there's a chance he could end that lengthy absence Saturday. The Bucks would certainly be thrilled as Butler scored a season-high 38 points on 13-of-22 shooting and had eight rebounds in last month's game against Philadelphia. Milwaukee is currently missing five other players: Larry Sanders (hand), Gary Neal (foot), Ersan Ilyasova (ankle), Carlos Delfino (foot) and Zaza Pachulia (foot). "We're a team that's really banged up and very depleted," coach Larry Drew said. "I'm proud of our guys that they've competed and played hard. But we're not going to be satisfied until we get over that hump." Milwaukee has also lost five straight at home and will try to avoid its first six-game skid since Feb. 4-20, 2012. Turner is averaging 24.0 points in his last three games in Milwaukee. Hawes is averaging 20.0 points and 12.5 rebounds in his last four overall matchups.
