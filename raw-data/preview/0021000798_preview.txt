Spurs-Wizards Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 11 2011 11:46PM After snapping their longest losing streak of the season, the Washington Wizards have a chance to end a skid against the San Antonio Spurs that's lasted more than five years. The Wizards try to avoid an 11th straight loss to the Spurs when the teams meet Saturday night in the nation's capital. Six players scored in double figures for Washington (14-37) as its eight-game losing streak came to an end with a 100-85 home win over Milwaukee on Wednesday night. "What happens is, you keep on saying 'hey, we're getting better' but sometimes you gotta have a win to show it," said coach Flip Saunders, whose club now has a chance to win consecutive games for only the second time this season. "That's something that is optical that you can see. Players need to get those and I thats something they can build (on)." Nick Young scored 26 points in Wednesday's win, while JaVale McGee had 16 points and 17 rebounds. The Wizards, who remain the only winless road team in the league, improved to 14-12 on their home court. "We've gotta worry about San Antonio, because they're the team thats here," Saunders said. "We've played against good teams pretty well at home and we'd like to get a signature win at home against a very good team - best team in the league." Saunders' club is all too familiar with how good the Spurs are. The Wizards have averaged 82.8 points during their 10-game losing streak in this series. They haven't defeated San Antonio since a 110-95 home victory Nov. 12, 2005. It's possible Washington may be without Rashard Lewis, averaging 18.1 points in his last seven games against the Spurs. Dealing with tendinitis in his right knee, Lewis managed three points Wednesday and is uncertain for this contest. San Antonio (44-9) boasts a strong defense and the league's best record, but had a terrible time scoring Friday night in a 77-71 loss at Philadelphia. The Spurs, who had their four-game winning streak snapped, shot a season-worst 33.3 percent from the floor - including a 3-of-17 effort from 3-point range - en route to their lowest scoring output since a 90-64 loss at Utah on April 4, 2008. "I think it set offensive basketball back a decade or so," coach Gregg Popovich said as his team fell to 4-2 on its current nine-game "Rodeo Road Trip". Manu Ginobili had eight points while shooting 2 of 10 from the floor, and Tony Parker finished with nine points. While his teammates couldn't get anything going, Tim Duncan recorded his 19th double-double of the season with 16 points and 13 rebounds. It was the Spurs' first loss of the season in a game where Duncan had a double-double. The 13-time All Star had only five points when these teams met in San Antonio on Dec. 26, but the Spurs won 94-80. Young also had a tough night for Washington, finishing with 10 points on 5-of-19 shooting. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
