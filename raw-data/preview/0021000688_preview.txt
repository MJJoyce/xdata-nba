Wizards-Thunder Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 27 2011 9:58PM Thanks in large part to Kevin Durant, the Oklahoma City Thunder are on the verge of their longest home winning streak of the season. The Washington Wizards' chances of snapping their franchise-worst start on the road seem unlikely. Looking for a season-best sixth consecutive home victory, the Thunder will try for a fourth straight win over Washington on Friday night. Durant led Oklahoma City (29-16) to a 118-117 overtime win Wednesday night at Minnesota, scoring a career high-tying 47 points and recording a career-best 18 rebounds. "All I can say is Durant is incredible," Timberwolves forward Kevin Love said. "He's incredible." Durant made 15 of 28 shots from the floor, including a step-back jumper with 28 seconds remaining in overtime to put the Thunder up for good. "I hope I don't ever take it for granted because that's pretty impressive," said teammate Nick Collison. "To be able to kind of carry us like that, we needed every one of those." Durant, who will start for the Western Conference in next month's All-Star game, is no stranger to playing the role of hero. He made a 3-pointer as time expired in Saturday night's 101-98 win over New York to extend Oklahoma City's home winning streak to five. While his 28.6 points per game lead the league, Durant has averaged 33.2 on 54.2 percent shooting over the Thunder's run at home. He has averaged 31.8 points on 58.5 percent from the floor in his last four games against the Wizards (13-31). The Thunder last recorded six home wins in a row Feb. 26-March 14, their longest run since relocating from Seattle following the 2007-08 season. Oklahoma City, which has averaged 108.3 points while taking three straight from Washington, has won 15 of 18 at home when scoring more than 100. The Wizards are allowing 108.7 points per game on the road, among the worst in the league. Washington continues to search for a win away from home after falling short in its first 21 road contests. Coach Flip Saunders, though, remains surprisingly optimistic as his team begins a four-game trip.    "I think our guys are looking forward to going on the road," Saunders said. "Sometimes going on the road for a four-game trip is better than going for one game because you have the opportunity to bond a little bit." The Wizards fell for the fourth time in five games overall with Tuesday night's 120-109 loss versus Denver despite another strong effort from the emerging Nick Young. Young scored 26 on 10-of-19 shooting and is averaging 23.6 points - 6.7 more than his season mark - over his last nine games. John Wall had 10 points and 13 assists Tuesday for his 15th double-double of the season. The No. 1 overall pick recorded four straight double-doubles on the road before registering 18 points and nine assists in a 115-106 loss at New York on Monday. Washington is eight road losses shy of matching the Dallas Mavericks' all-time record of 29 consecutive defeats to begin a season. The Wizards could be without Kirk Hinrich, who missed the last three games with a sprained right elbow. Hinrich is averaging 11.1 points. Washington has averaged 91.5 points over its last 10 road games. Oklahoma City is 9-1 at home when holding opponents to 100 points or less. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
