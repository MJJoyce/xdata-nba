Hawks-Celtics Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Dec 16 2010 11:33AM Paul Pierce helped the Boston Celtics survive a close to call to extend their season-high winning streak. Now, they'll look to keep it going against the same team they beat to start their run. Boston can win its 12th straight game for the first time since Jan. 11-Feb. 3, 2009, when it hosts the Atlanta Hawks. This is the fifth winning streak of 10 or more games for the Celtics (20-4) since Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen joined Paul Pierce on the team for the start of 2007-08. Last season, Boston won 11 straight at nearly the exact same time - Nov. 22-Dec. 14 - before falling short of a 12th consecutive victory. The current streak reached 11 on Wednesday - barely. Pierce's jumper with 0.4 seconds remaining capped a come-from-behind 118-116 victory over New York. The Knicks' Amare Stoudemire then made a 3-point attempt, but it was ruled to have come after the buzzer. "When I seen that shot, it was like (Pierce) went to a natural shooting rhythm and just seemed like he took a little bit more time," Allen said. "And that goes back to our possession when (Pierce) hit the shot, taking as much time off the clock that we could, because imagine if they had .8 on the clock or .9 on the clock, that would have been a different story." Pierce finished with a season-high 32 points to lead Boston, which also got 20 points and 13 rebounds from Kevin Garnett and 26 points from Allen to become the first Eastern Conference team to 20 wins. The Celtics will also become the first to 21 if they repeat their performance against the Hawks (16-10) from Nov. 22 in Atlanta. Despite the absence of point guard Rajon Rondo, Boston dominated Atlanta 99-76 to snap a four-game losing streak in the series, limiting the Hawks starters to a combined 27 points. "This was very embarrassing," Atlanta coach Larry Drew said after that game. "Very, very embarrassing. Very embarrassing. If I had one word to sum it up: embarrassing." Drew may have felt similarly Tuesday when the Hawks turned a three-point deficit entering the fourth quarter into a 103-80 blowout loss to Detroit. The Hawks are 10-10 since starting the season 6-0. Each of their last three losses have come by at least 12 points. Josh Smith, who is averaging 24.0 points over his last four games, scored a game-high 26. Al Horford added 17 and 12 rebounds. Smith, Horford, Marvin Williams and the since-injured Joe Johnson combined to shoot 6 for 29 in the November loss to Boston. The Hawks also won't have top reserve Jamal Crawford for this game due to a sore back. The guard is averaging 14.8 points. The Celtics are 3-2 in the second game of back-to-backs, though they may be without centers Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal, who both sat out Wednesday due to injury.
