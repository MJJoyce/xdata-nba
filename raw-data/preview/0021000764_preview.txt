Jazz-Kings Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 06 2011 12:22PM The Sacramento Kings find themselves in the midst of a brutal part of their schedule. While they might not have originally been looking forward to their next matchup, the Kings will try to take advantage of a home meeting with the stumbling Utah Jazz on Monday night. After upsetting the two-time defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers on the road and ending New Orleans' season-best 10-game winning streak, the Kings (12-35) fell 95-90 to Eastern Conference-leading Boston before losing 113-100 on Friday night to San Antonio - the league leader with 42 wins. "We know we have a tough stretch coming up," Omri Casspi told the Kings' official website. "We talked about it - we had the Lakers, New Orleans, Boston, San Antonio and we have Utah, Dallas and Oklahoma City coming (up). "We have to play our best to win those games and we weren't at our best (Friday) night." After shooting 50 percent or better in the wins over the Lakers and Hornets, the Kings failed to reach 44 percent in the losses to the Celtics and Spurs. Additionally, Sacramento was held to a season-low 35.8 percent shooting in its 94-83 loss at Utah on Nov. 22. Tyreke Evans, leading the team with 18.0 points per game, scored 25 against the Spurs. Last season's rookie of the year is averaging 23.0 points - tied for his second-most versus any opponent - against Utah. He was, however, held to 11 in the last meeting. Utah (30-22) has lost nine of 12 after a 121-105 defeat Saturday night at the hands of Oklahoma City despite 34 points and 10 rebounds from Paul Millsap. While the Jazz took a 10-point lead into the second quarter after becoming the first NBA team to start a game 11 for 11 from the floor this season, they were outscored 35-20 over the next 12 minutes and trailed for the remainder of the game. "You want to come out and win at home, that's the main thing we want to do," said Millsap, who is averaging just 8.1 points against Sacramento. "We gotta keep pushing through it, and hopefully at the end of the day, we'll be on top." Deron Williams scored 14 points and registered 11 assists in his second game back after missing four with a strained tendon in his right wrist. Williams went 0 of 4 from 3-point range and has made just two of his last 19 attempts (10.5 percent) from long distance. Williams has averaged 15.1 points over 18 career games versus the Kings, nearly seven points below his 2010-11 average of 21.9. Utah snapped a six-game road losing streak - its longest in thee seasons - with a 113-106 win at Denver on Friday night. It was just the third time in 12 road games the Jazz won when allowing 100 or more points. While Utah's Andrei Kirilenko remains uncertain to play after sitting out three straight games with a sprained left ankle, Kings starting center Jason Thompson is likely to return after missing two contests with a sprained right ankle. Thompson is averaging 8.2 points and 5.8 rebounds. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
