Magic-76ers Preview By MATT BECKER Posted Feb 08 2011 11:55PM The Orlando Magic are likely going to make a fifth straight postseason appearance, but they haven't looked much like a playoff-bound team lately. Trying to regain their swagger against a suddenly surging Philadelphia 76ers team probably won't be too easy. The inconsistent Magic try to win back-to-back games for the first time in 2 1/2 weeks Wednesday night against the 76ers, who are coming off their most lopsided victory of the season. After going a league-best 13-3 from Dec. 23-Jan. 22, Orlando has lost five of nine. The Magic (33-20) are still one-half game back of Atlanta for fourth place in the Eastern Conference, but haven't looked that impressive lately, with their last three victories coming over Cleveland, Washington and the Los Angeles Clippers, some of the league's worst teams. Orlando defeated the Clippers 101-85 on Tuesday in a game that was closer than the final score indicates. The score was tied at 70 with just over 9 minutes to play before the Magic, who trailed most of the game, went on a 12-0 run to take control. Dwight Howard had 22 points and 20 rebounds, and coach Stan Van Gundy was pleased with the way his team finished after a sluggish first three quarters. "When I see 25 fast-break points and 23 second-chance points, I know we played hard and with good energy," he said. Van Gundy's team now tries to notch back-to-back victories for the first time since winning three in a row Jan. 19-22. This stretch started with a 99-98 overtime win over Philadelphia. Howard finished with 18 points and seven rebounds in that game, but the five-time All-Star has recorded a double-double in all 11 games since. The Magic have won 13 of the last 15 meetings with Philadelphia. They did lose to the Sixers 97-89 at home on Dec. 18, but only had eight players available after making trades for Gilbert Arenas and Hedo Turkoglu earlier in the day. Orlando could have similar problems this time, after traveling for the second game of a back-to-back. The 76ers (24-27) are also playing the second game of a back-to-back, but they should be a bit more rested after sitting most of their starters down the stretch in Tuesday's easy 117-83 win in Atlanta. Philadelphia, seventh in the East, made quick work of the Hawks, jumping out to a 20-point lead in the first quarter and a 65-33 advantage at halftime. Louis Williams led all scorers with 20 points, while Elton Brand, who didn't play at all in the fourth quarter, added 17 for the Sixers, winners of seven of nine. "I never could have imagined that kind of win," coach Doug Collins said. "I mean, our guys have been playing well. But we came out and had a real sense of purpose." Philadelphia's offense has spurred this turnaround, averaging 105.3 points in the last eight games - 7.0 better than its season average. Brand was 5 of 6 from the field Tuesday, and is averaging 26.0 points on 67.4 percent shooting in his last three games, but didn't have much luck last month against Orlando, finishing with eight points on 4 of 11 from the field.
