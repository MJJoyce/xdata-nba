Warriors-Mavericks Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Dec 06 2010 2:50PM The Dallas Mavericks continue to roll, but surprisingly, its their defense that has been the catalyst. The Mavericks will look to extend their winning streak to 10 games and make it four straight victories against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night at American Airlines Center. Dallas (16-4) continues to play outstanding defense, allowing 92.2 points per contest while limiting opponents to 43.1 percent shooting - both among the best marks in the league. "That's our identity now, we hang our hat on it (defense)," said Jason Terry. "That started two years ago and we bought into it. That's the biggest thing we have going for us now." That commitment to defense was evident again Saturday night. The Mavericks trailed Sacramento 99-90 with just over five minutes remaining before clamping down and outscoring the Kings 15-4 en route to a 105-103 victory. "I remember it was 99-90 and we were able to lock them down from that point on," Tyson Chandler said. "We were able to close it out. This was huge one for us coming off a big win (Friday night) against Utah. Everyone was a little tired, but we withstood their runs." The nine-game run is Dallas' longest since it won 13 in a row Feb. 17-March 10. Dirk Nowitzki led the way with 25 points Saturday and is averaging 25.1 during Dallas' streak. However, the nine-time All Star has been limited to 14.0 points on 10 of 23 shooting his last two meetings with the Warriors. Although the Mavericks have held 16 of 20 opponents under 100 points this season, the Warriors have hit the century mark 12 times in the last 16 meetings. Golden State is averaging 107.0 points - second most by an opponent during that span. While the Warriors (8-12) remain a potent offensive team, defense continues to be a major problem. They rank near the bottom of the NBA in scoring defense, yielding 106.9 points per game. Golden State, which has lost three straight and eight of nine, has been plagued by poor first quarters lately. They have been outscored by a combined 30 points during opening quarters in the three-game skid and trailed Oklahoma City by 15 after the first 12 minutes in Sunday night's 114-109 loss. "There's frustration as to why we can't start off the way we finish the second, third and fourth quarters. We won the game by like 10 after the first quarter," said Stephen Curry, who scored a season-high 39 points. "We've just got to figure out how to come out of the blocks a little bit faster." Monta Ellis added 29 points and is averaging 33.5 in his last two games. "We've got to just go on to practice and put this one behind us," he told the team's official site after the Warriors scored a season-high 67 points in the second half. "We need to take this third and fourth quarter and try to convert it over to the next game. It's a long season. We are at a great position. We just have to keep playing together. It's going to turn for us; I know it is." Ellis has put up 35.0 points during his last three visits to Dallas - 16.5 more than his career average. The Warriors have lost five of six at Dallas.
