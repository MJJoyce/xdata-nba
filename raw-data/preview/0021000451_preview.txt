Wizards-Rockets Preview By MATT BROWN Posted Dec 26 2010 11:03PM The last time the Washington Wizards and Houston Rockets faced each other, John Wall's first career triple-double lifted Washington to victory. The Rockets are playing much better these days, while Wall has just started playing again following a significant absence. Houston seeks to extend its season-best winning streak to five Monday when it hosts Wall and a Wizards team still seeking its first road win. The Rockets (14-15) dug a big hole early this season, dropping their first five games and falling to 3-10 before beginning to turn things around. In the middle of that slump was a 98-91 loss at Washington on Nov. 10. Now, Houston has won 14 of 24 and needs only to reverse last-month's result against the Eastern Conference-worst Wizards (7-21) to improve to .500 for the first time in 2010-11. "We're playing better," said forward Shane Battier, who had 13 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in Wednesday's 97-92 victory at the Los Angeles Clippers. "It took us a little while to find out who we were. We're playing with more confidence, and sometimes that goes a long way in this league." Kevin Martin had a game-high 28 points and Luis Scola added 22 as the Rockets held on to beat the Clippers. They nearly blew an 18-point lead but managed to record their third wire-to-wire victory of the season. The Rockets' four-game winning streak matches their longest from 2009-10. They haven't won five in a row since April 5-13, 2009. Wall had 19 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds in last month's meeting - earning plenty of respect from Houston. "He seems like he loves the game," said Martin, who led all scorers with 31 points in the loss. "He gets his teammates involved. You can't call him a true leader right now, but you can see the leadership qualities in him." At the time, Wall appeared poised for instant NBA stardom. However, the top overall draft pick has had trouble staying on the court in recent weeks. He's missed 12 of the last 20 games - the majority due to a bothersome right knee. That knee had sidelined him for five straight contests before Sunday, when he came off the bench to play more than 19 minutes but finished with a career-low four points on 2-of-9 shooting in a 94-80 loss at San Antonio. "I wasn't used to it. I haven't played in two weeks and a half," Wall said. "But running on a bike is different than running on the court." Rashard Lewis, acquired Dec. 18 from Orlando, had 21 points and 12 rebounds to lead a Wizards team playing without forwards Andray Blatche and JaVale McGee, who were suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team. Blatche and McGee are eligible to return Monday. Washington has lost two straight - scoring 80 points each time - and nine of 10 overall. At 0-14, they are the NBA's last remaining winless road team.
