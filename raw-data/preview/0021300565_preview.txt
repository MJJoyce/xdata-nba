Cavaliers-Lakers Preview By JORDAN GARRETSON Posted Jan 13 2014 3:42PM The Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers suffered two of the most embarrassing losses of the NBA season over the weekend. They'll try shake the memories of those lopsided defeats at each other's expense in Los Angeles on Tuesday night. Both teams have struggled in 2013-14, but the Lakers (14-23) have been particularly bad lately. They've dropped 10 of 11 and four in a row, including their worst-ever loss to the Clippers on Friday, 123-87. "I don't think there was one positive thing we could take from this game," said point guard Kendall Marshall, who remained in the game after rolling his ankle in the third and finished with 16 points and 10 assists. "We were competitive for maybe 5 minutes, and we just can't have that." The Lakers' 34.5 field-goal percentage was their second lowest of the season and they've shot 41.0 percent over their last 11 games while giving up 110.2 points. They also committed 21 turnovers. Leading scorer Nick Young has made 38.5 percent during the 1-10 stretch with 30 turnovers. Pau Gasol is shooting a career-low 44.8 percent on the season and scored 10 on 5-of-15 shooting Friday. "Right now, it seems like teams are playing with too much confidence," Gasol said. "They're taking for granted that the Lakers are just an easy game, that they're going to come out and are just going to score 120-130 points, everybody's going to get their points, and it's going to be a wonderful night. We've just got to cut that out somehow." The Cavaliers (13-24) might not come into Staples Center with much confidence after their 124-80 loss at Sacramento on Sunday, the most lopsided in the league this season. It marked the sixth time in 11 road games that Cleveland has allowed an opponent to shoot at least 50.0 percent, and the fifth time in seven games overall it's been limited to 87 or fewer points. Kyrie Irving was 3 of 14 from the floor and 1 of 4 from the line for seven points. He had gone 15 of 27 on field goals over two straight victories after missing three contests due to a sore knee. Cleveland is one of the league's worst road teams at 3-16. "It was just one of those nights. The shots were not falling," Irving said. "Like Coach said, we just have to bring it in more and be more together during the hard times. Especially when I am having a bad shooting night. That's part of the game. We just have to continue to compete, including myself." Luol Deng has gone 9 of 19 and scored 22 points in two games since being acquired from Chicago. The Lakers have won three straight and four of five against the Cavaliers in Los Angeles. Copyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
