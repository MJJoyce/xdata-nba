A trip to Philadelphia might help them get it done. LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh try to lead the Heat to a fifth consecutive win over the 76ers on Wednesday night. Collectively, Miami's new Big 3 didn't fare well in an 88-80 road loss to defending Eastern Conference champion Boston on Tuesday. James scored 21 of his 31 points in the second half as the Heat tried to mount a comeback after a slow start. However, Wade was limited to 13 on 4-of-16 shooting and Bosh eight with eight rebounds. The trio combined for 15 of Miami's 17 turnovers, including eight by James. "I'm sorry if everybody thought we were going to go 82-0. It just ain't happening," Wade said. While it's one game, it might take some time for the team to mesh. Miami shot 36.5 percent overall and scored nine points in the first quarter. In no quarter last season did the Heat without James and Bosh score so few points. Neither did James with Cleveland in 2009-10. "Right now it's a feel-out process for myself, for D-Wade, for Chris and for the rest of the guys," James said. The Heat went 7-6 when Wade scored fewer than 20 points last season. "We know it isn't going to be easy," Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. "It's not a reason to panic right now. ... I already imagine we'll be much better (Wednesday)." The potential for improvement against the 76ers is certainly possible. Wade averaged 28.5 points to help Miami go 4-0 versus Philadelphia last season. Bosh has averaged 25.7 points in his last nine road games against the 76ers, while James has poured in 29.3 in 12 career contests at Philadelphia. While the Heat added James and Bosh, the 76ers brought in lesser known role players like 7-foot-1 Spencer Hawes and veteran Andres Nocioni after finishing 27-55 and missing the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. Philadelphia's biggest acquisition is on the bench where former Sixer Doug Collins returns for the first time since coaching Washington from 2001-03. Collins has experience in helping the franchise make a turnaround. He was drafted No. 1 overall in 1973 by a Sixers team coming off an all-time NBA-worst 9-73 record. Four years later, they were in the NBA finals. Replacing Eddie Jordan after one season, Collins is Philadelphia's seventh coach since Larry Brown left in 2003. "I know the pulse of this city," said Collins, who will be on the sidelines despite being diagnosed with vertigo last week. "I've had a chance to live it. I'm blessed to be the coach here and I don't take that responsibility lightly." The Sixers also stripped Ed Stefanski of his presidency and made him general manager, while hiring former New Jersey Nets boss Rod Thorn as team president. "I think we were all ready to move on from last year," forward Thaddeus Young said. Though Andre Iguodala averaged 17.1 points - his lowest in four seasons - in 2009-10, he set career highs with 6.5 rebounds and 5.8 assists per contest. The Sixers need forward Elton Brand to finally break out after two disappointing seasons since coming over from the Los Angeles Clippers. After a shoulder injury limited him to 29 games in 2008-09, Brand averaged career lows for points (13.1) and rebounds (6.1) in 76 games last season. Brand averaged 9.3 points and 5.5 rebounds against the Heat last season. Second overall pick Evan Turner will come off the bench to start, but the AP player of the year could help Philadelphia improve on the 97.7 points it averaged in 2009-10. He averaged 20.3 points, 9.2 boards and 5.9 assists for Ohio State last season. "It's not about me, it's about the team," said Turner, who shot 31 percent in seven preseason games.
