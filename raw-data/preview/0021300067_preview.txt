Warriors-Timberwolves Preview By JUSTIN EINHORN Posted Nov 05 2013 3:03PM After dealing this season's first Eastern Conference player of the week a rough night, the Golden State Warriors hope to saddle the West winner with another one. Kevin Love and the Minnesota Timberwolves try to bounce back from their first loss as they host the Warriors on Wednesday night in a matchup filled with sharpshooters. Each team is off to a 3-1 start and has two players averaging more than 21 points. Love tops that group with 26.5 per game but is coming off his worst performance, scoring 17 on 8-of-20 shooting and missing a 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds left as Minnesota fell 93-92 in Cleveland. "My team trusts me to make that shot and more often than not I believe that I'm going to make the shot," said Love, who missed all seven of his 3-point attempts. The 2012 3-point Shootout champion, who did grab 13 rebounds for his fourth straight double-double, made eight 3s during the Timberwolves' 3-0 start while averaging 29.7 points to win West player of the week honors. Golden State faced the East winner Monday at Philadelphia, limiting Michael Carter-Williams to 4 of 17 from the field and forcing him into six turnovers in an easy 110-90 victory. Stephen Curry matched Carter-Williams with 18 points but clearly outplayed the rookie en route to his second career triple-double - 18 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds to go with five steals. "He's done everything right for me, put me in position to be a successful coach," Mark  Jackson said of Curry, who has made a league-high 18 3-pointers in 36 attempts. Teammate Klay Thompson has hit 13 of 25 while averaging 22.5 points - Curry is at 22.0 - but it was offseason acquisition Andre Iguodala who had the highest-scoring game in the league Monday with 32. "We have a really great group and our offense flows really well," said Iguodala, who made a career-best seven 3s. "We share the ball. We have two of the best shooters in the league of all time, and it gives us really good spacing." Timberwolves newcomer Kevin Martin has benefited from Love and Ricky Rubio spacing the floor, averaging 21.3 points and going 12 for 20 from beyond the arc. Martin scored 23 on Monday, but Rubio was 0 for 7 from the field with five assists - he had at least 10 in each of the first three games. "It seemed like K-Mart was really the only guy that could find his legs from outside tonight but we'll get a chance to rest (Tuesday)," Love said. "I mention that short term memory – win or lose we just have to get back on that grind." Martin has gone 30 of 53 from 3-point range (56.7 percent) in his last nine matchups with the Warriors while averaging 25.3 points. However, this is his first time facing them since joining Minnesota, which has lost the last six meetings. David Lee has averaged 20.6 points and 10.8 boards during that win streak and helped Golden State outrebound the Timberwolves by an average of 12.0 in last season's four-game sweep. Love was limited to 15 points and 6-of-20 shooting in his only matchup with Golden State last season. In Minnesota's only two wins over the Warriors in the last 14 meetings, Love averaged 36.5 points and 19.5 rebounds. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
