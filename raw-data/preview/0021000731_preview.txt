Bucks-Warriors Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Feb 03 2011 1:02AM A stop in the Bay Area might be what the Milwaukee Bucks need to help avoid being swept on their brief western trip. The injury-riddled Bucks look to avoid a third straight loss Thursday night while trying for their fifth consecutive victory over the Golden State Warriors. Milwaukee (19-28) had won three in a row before opening the three-game trek with a 105-98 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday. The Bucks fell short despite shooting 49.3 percent in that contest, but were far from that good while making a season-low 31.1 percent of their shots in Wednesday's 92-77 loss at Phoenix. Without injured center Andrew Bogut, Milwaukee matched its second-lowest point total of the season. The Bucks are last in the NBA in points per game (91.6) and field-goal percentage (42.4). "We just haven't been a good shooting team in the league the entire season," guard Earl Boykins said. "We shoot 31 percent, how do you win a basketball game shooting that way?" Though the Bucks have averaged 112.0 points while winning four straight against Golden State (20-27), they could suffer again if the veteran Bogut is out for a second straight game because of a bruised knee. Bogut has played well lately, averaging 18.3 points his last three contests. He had 15 with 16 rebounds in a 113-104 win in the Bucks' last visit to Golden State on Jan. 15, 2010. The Bucks also announced Wednesday that veteran Drew Gooden will miss another four to six weeks because of lingering problems with plantar fasciitis in his left foot. Former Warrior Corey Maggette continues to pace the Bucks. He scored 15 against the Suns and has averaged 18.7 points since starting the last 10 games. Though Milwaukee has struggled to make baskets this season, it's done well preventing others from doing so by ranking fourth in the NBA allowing 93.1 points per contest. The Bucks held the Warriors to season lows for points and shooting percentage (34.1) in a 79-72 home win Nov. 13. Monta Ellis was one of two Warriors to score in double-figures that contest with 24 points. Ellis (25.1 ppg), who has a good chance to become Golden State's first All-Star selection since Latrell Sprewell in 1997, has averaged 27.1 points on 51.5 percent shooting his last three games versus Milwaukee. However, Ellis is coming off a season-low two-point, 1-for-9 shooting effort in Sunday's 96-81 victory over Utah. Stephen Curry had 27 points with seven assists and six rebounds to help the Warriors snap a four-game skid that followed a stretch of four straight victories. "You have to win a lot of different ways if you want to be successful," Curry said. "Every night's not going to be pretty. Even if everybody is not on their game, you have to find ways to win." Curry has averaged 25.7 points on 54.9 percent shooting the last six games. However, he was held to seven and went 3 of 14 from the field against the Bucks in November.
