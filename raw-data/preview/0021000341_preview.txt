Grizzlies-Clippers Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Dec 10 2010 4:21PM A pair of shots at the buzzer led to very different outcomes for the Los Angeles Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies in their last games. The Grizzlies look to close a four-game road trip with back-to-back wins when they meet the league-worst Clippers on Saturday. Memphis (9-14) snapped a four-game losing streak with a 104-98 overtime win at Phoenix on Wednesday. Zach Randolph scored a season-high 34 points and Rudy Gay added 22. Gay sent the game into overtime with a 3-pointer before the buzzer after Memphis let a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter slip away. "We didn't fold, but we've got to learn how to win games," said Randolph, who made 15 of his 19 shots and also had 17 rebounds. "We have to learn to sustain that lead to be a playoff team that we want to be." Randolph is averaging 20.4 points and 14.0 rebounds in five games this month. His work on the boards has helped the Grizzlies play better defense the last two games, as they've allowed 96 points in each on 42.0 percent shooting. Opponents are averaging 102.9 points and shooting 46.1 percent against Memphis. Saturday's game will feature two of the league's top rebounders in Randolph and Los Angeles rookie Blake Griffin. Randolph is averaging 11.8 boards while Griffin grabs 11.7 per game. Griffin had another good game Wednesday against the Lakers with 16 points and 11 rebounds, but the Clippers (5-18) lost 87-86 after Derek Fisher scored on a layup at the buzzer. The loss capped a disappointing performance by the Clippers, who led by 12 in the third quarter but had 20 turnovers and were held to more than 10 points below their season average, totaling 15 in the fourth. "Hopefully, it's a learning experience to us," said Eric Gordon, who scored 24 points. "We lose basically on turnovers. In crunch time, we made a couple of bad plays and that is what gave them a chance." Marred by injuries, including to Chris Kaman and Baron Davis, that have forced them to turn to a young lineup, the Clippers have the worst record in the NBA. Their previous two losses against Denver and Portland - both on the road - were by a combined 14 points. "No one is going to feel sorry for you," coach Vinny Del Negro said. "You have to keep fighting, battling and improving. These games are good for all these young guys." Los Angeles has won six of seven at home against the Grizzlies, averaging 104.7 points. Gordon averaged 20.7 points and 5.6 assists in three games against Memphis last season. The Grizzlies, who haven't won two in a row since a season-high three-game run Nov. 20-26, are 3-9 on the road.
