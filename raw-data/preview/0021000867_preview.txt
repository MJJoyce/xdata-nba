Thunder-Magic Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Feb 25 2011 12:25AM With Kevin Durant and Dwight Howard as their respective centerpieces, the Oklahoma City Thunder and Orlando Magic are viable contenders for an NBA championship. Only the Thunder made moves to improve their chances, while Howard and the Magic aren't happy with much lately. With Kendrick Perkins and Nate Robinson possibly joining Durant in the lineup Friday night, the Thunder seek their first win at Orlando in almost seven years. Oklahoma City (36-20) leads the Northwest Division this late in a season for the first time since winning it as the Seattle SuperSonics in 2005. Durant is a major reason for the Thunder's success, leading the NBA in scoring for a second consecutive season, averaging 28.8 points in 2010-11 while his 7.1 rebounds tie Serge Ibaka for the team high. Howard is Orlando's team leader with 23.0 points per game and his 13.9 rebounds rank second in the league, as the Magic (36-22) are fourth in the Eastern Conference. Only one of these All-Stars, though, is getting help for the stretch run. The Thunder landed Perkins and Robinson from Boston in exchange for forward Jeff Green, center Nenad Kristic, a 2012 first-round pick and cash prior to Thursday's trade deadline. Perkins appears to be what Oklahoma City was looking for, a strong defender at center who helped the Celtics win the 2008 title and lose to the Los Angeles Lakers in seven games last season. Oklahoma City allows an average of 102.3 points, easily the worst of the six division leaders. "We had a unique opportunity to add a proven presence in our front court in acquiring Kendrick," general manager Sam Presti said. "He will help anchor our defense while Nate will add depth and athleticism to our backcourt." Perkins, though, has played just 12 games since returning from knee injury sustained in Game 6 of the NBA finals. He's averaging 7.3 points and 8.1 rebounds, getting a season-high 13 boards with Boston while playing opposite Howard in a 91-80 win over Orlando on Feb. 6. Robinson, averaging 7.1 points in 55 games - 11 starts - with the Celtics this season, will provide depth behind star guard Russell Westbrook. The additions might be timely after Durant scored 30 with nine rebounds while Westbrook added 25 points and seven assists in a 109-105 loss at San Antonio. The other three Thunder starters combined for 18 points. Westbrook had a triple-double with 32 points, 13 assists and 10 boards while Durant scored 36 in a 125-124 win over Orlando on Jan. 13. The Thunder have dropped six consecutive visits to Orlando since a win there March 13, 2004. The Magic have split their last 14 games, and Howard was livid following their 26.3 percent shooting in the fourth quarter of Wednesday's 111-105 loss to last-place Sacramento. "We've been talking for a long time - all we seem to do is talk," Howard said. "We have a lot of talent, but talent won't win you championships. You get to the finals, both teams are very talented. That's how they got to the finals. But hard work, commitment-every play, every night is what gets you the championship. "We're one of the most talented teams in the NBA. We're a deep team, we have guys that can do a lot of different things, but if you don't bring it, it's a waste of talent." Howard is doing his part, averaging 31.3 points and 13.3 rebounds over the last three games. He had 39 points and 18 boards in the latest meeting with Oklahoma City.
