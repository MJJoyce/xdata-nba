Trail Blazers-Timberwolves Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Jan 06 2011 9:05PM The Portland Trail Blazers overcame a sizable late deficit and pulled out a victory in their last game. They probably won't face the same dilemma on Friday night. That's when Portland will try to win its 14th straight over the last-place Minnesota Timberwolves as the Northwest Division rivals meet at the Target Center. Coming off an 84-81 loss to Dallas the night before, the Trail Blazers (19-17) erased a 13-point fourth-quarter deficit for a 103-100 victory over Houston on Wednesday. Portland got 36 points off the bench from Rudy Fernandez, Dante Cunningham and Patrick Mills, who hit four 3-pointers and matched a career high with 14. "The second unit was terrific," Marcus Camby told the Trail Blazers' website after the team improved to 7-3 since star guard Brandon Roy went out with a knee injury. "They provided a spark and that's what won the game for us. This is a team game and we got the win and that's all that matters." After snapping a six-game skid in Houston, the Trail Blazers, who last won consecutive road games on Oct. 27 and 30, will try to record their seventh straight victory at Minnesota. They'll face a Timberwolves team trying to bounce back from Wednesday's 108-105 overtime loss to Charlotte. Minnesota (9-27) rallied from 16 down in the third quarter and led by eight with less than three minutes to play in regulation, but Kurt Rambis' team committed five turnovers in the extra session and botched their final possession as Michael Beasley launched an off-balance 27-footer at the buzzer that didn't come close. "Not accurately tonight," Rambis said when asked if his players were executing his plays. "No, they did not." Kevin Love, though, continues to be a bright spot for the lowly Timberwolves, leading the league with 31 double-doubles and 15.6 rebounds per game. While Love scored 35 points and had 15 boards against the Bobcats to extend his career-high streak of double-doubles to 22 - tying him with Los Angeles Clippers rookie Blake Griffin for the longest current run in the league - the Timberwolves' third-year forward is more concerned with helping the team improve its poor play. Minnesota averages 17.3 turnovers and is giving up 108.6 points per game - both NBA highs. "There's not much Kurt can do," Love said. "We're the ones out there playing and making the mistakes. We were the ones who missed free throws ... committed dumb fouls, turned the ball over. It's not just one person. It's collectively, the entire unit." Beasley scored 33 points and Love added 19 with 17 boards as Minnesota dropped its 13th straight to Portland, 107-102 on Dec. 17 at the Rose Garden. LaMarcus Aldridge scored a career-high 36 while Fernandez also had a career night with 26 and six assists. In the teams' last matchup in Minnesota, the Trail Blazers won 110-91 on Feb. 27 as Nicolas Batum recorded career highs with 31 points and seven assists. Minnesota's last victory versus Portland was 94-93 at home on March 25, 2007. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
