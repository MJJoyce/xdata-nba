Detroit looks for its fourth win in five games since its ugly beginning Sunday at Arco Arena, where the Kings try to avoid a fifth consecutive loss. The Pistons (3-6) blew three halftime leads in losing their first five games, but managed to head into a four-game Western road trip with a little momentum after a pair of home victories. They fell to 0-4 on the road after a 22-point drubbing in Portland on Tuesday, and looked like they might blow another lead Friday after allowing the Los Angeles Clippers to rally from a 14-point deficit to force overtime. But this time they didn't fold, using a 9-0 run in the extra five minutes to pick up a 113-107 victory. "We were definitely determined to get a win on the road, we haven't been so good on the road," reserve Charlie Villanueva said after scoring a season-high 30 points. "This was a game that we definitely needed." The Pistons have won consecutive road games just once since March 2009, but have reason to believe they can do it again Sunday. Detroit has won its last two visits to Sacramento (3-5), including a 100-92 win Feb. 23 behind 30 points from Richard Hamilton. It'll be expecting a big game from Tayshaun Prince against the Kings. He's scored between 10 and 17 points in each game this season, but has scored at least 22 in his last four games versus Sacramento - something he's never done against any other opponent. The Pistons will also be looking for early success at Arco, particularly considering they average an NBA-low 42.8 points in the second half. When it comes to fast starts, the Kings have been one of the league's most accommodating teams. Sacramento has allowed 58.3 points per game prior to halftime - 29th in the league - and has trailed in all eight games. Phoenix only had 52 points at the break Friday, but that proved to be enough. The Kings shot a season-low 40.9 percent while Suns guard Steve Nash had 28 points and 14 assists in a 103-89 loss, their fourth straight. "We didn't play well enough to get the job done," said Carl Landry, who had 20 points and 11 rebounds. "We did some things that were positive and things we can grow off of and learn from, but not quite well enough to get the win." Sacramento has been held to 91 or fewer points in each of its last three defeats, a troubling trend for a team that needs to score to be successful. The Kings are 1-55 since the start of the 2007-08 season when they score under 92 points. One way to take advantage of Detroit is on the boards. The Pistons' minus-5.2 rebound differential is one of the league's worst marks. Sacramento, meanwhile, is among the league's best offensive rebounding clubs (13.4 per game) thanks to Landry and Samuel Dalembert, who have it tied for second in second-chance points (17.3). The Kings' lone win over Detroit in the past two seasons came 103-97 at The Palace on Feb. 10 behind 22 points from Beno Udrih. The guard's 54.8 shooting percentage against the Pistons is his best against any opponent. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
