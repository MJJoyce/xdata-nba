Warriors-Grizzlies Preview By JORDAN GARRETSON Posted Dec 07 2013 1:54AM The Golden State Warriors have been dominated by the Memphis Grizzlies over the last three seasons. A trend that could very well continue if Golden State can't shake off Friday's ugly offensive performance. The Warriors will try to snap an 11-game skid in the series when they visit the Grizzlies on Saturday night. Golden State hasn't notched a win over the Grizzlies since Nov. 3, 2010, and has also dropped nine in a row in Memphis since April 4, 2008. Memphis has already won two meetings this season, including an 88-81 overtime road victory Nov. 20 despite shooting 38.6 percent. A win Saturday would give the Grizzlies their longest winning streak over a single opponent. They've won 11 in a row against Minnesota. The Warriors (11-9), who are averaging 93.3 points during the skid against the Grizzlies - compared to 101.1 points in all games since the streak started on Nov. 26, 2010 - were offensively inept in a 105-83 loss at Houston on Friday. It was their worst defeat since a 140-109 setback, also in Houston on Feb. 5. They shot a season-low 35.5 percent from the field and were 2 of 16 from 3-point range. Stephen Curry had 22 points but was 5 for 14 and committed eight turnovers while Klay Thompson was 2 for 10. "It's like tonight we didn't hit shots early, and we have a tendency to dwell on that, and we weren't getting stops and we can't turn the ball over on offense," Curry said after the Warriors finished with 12 first-quarter points and trailed 61-37 at halftime. They committed 22 turnovers after averaging just 14.8 over the previous five games. "We gave them extra possessions early in the game to get their confidence going," Curry said. Zach Randolph has five straight double-doubles against Golden State, but he struggled in a 101-81 defeat to the Clippers on Thursday, marking the fifth loss in the last six home games for the Grizzlies (9-9). Randolph was 4 of 13 for 12 points with 12 rebounds in his first contest after missing two following surgery on an ingrown toenail. Kosta Koufos scored a team-high 17 points in his fifth start in place of the injured Marc Gasol, but he was 5 of 12. "The Clippers played real well defensively," Koufos said. "They established themselves early in the second half. They hit some tough shots." Memphis' reserves were outscored 50-31, though the Grizzlies likely won't have the same problem against a Warriors bench averaging 22.3 points - third-worst in the league. Tony Allen was sidelined due to a bruised hip he suffered in Tuesday's win over Phoenix and is listed as day-to-day. Jerryd Bayless is listed as Saturday's probable starter. Mike Conley, who scored 16 points on 6-of-8 shooting Thursday, is hitting 45.9 percent of his 3-pointers during Memphis' win streak in the series. He's a 37.2 percent 3-point shooter for his career. Thompson, a career 41.4 percent shooter from beyond the arc, is shooting 30.8 percent from long range in nine career games against the Grizzlies. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
