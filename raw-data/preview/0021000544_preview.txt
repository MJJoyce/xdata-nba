Tyreke Evans and DeMarcus Cousins will now try to help the Kings stop a nine-game road skid when they face the struggling Toronto Raptors to open a season-high six-game trip Sunday. Evans had 27 points and 12 assists to lift the Kings to a 122-102 victory win over Denver on Thursday. He went 11 for 18 from the field, following up an 11-of-19, 29-point effort Tuesday to give him two straight outstanding shooting performances. The 2009-10 rookie of the year, who has dealt with foot problems and family issues this season, is averaging 17.2 points and 39.3 percent from the floor after scoring 20.1 points a game and shooting 45.8 percent last season. Cousins has bounced back from being relegated to the bench for disciplinary reasons to regain his starting center spot. The rookie made a choking gesture at Golden State's Reggie Williams during an overtime loss Dec. 21, and was used as a reserve the next three games. He had 21 points and 16 rebounds off the bench against Memphis on Dec. 29 and has started the four contests since, averaging 21.8 points and 9.0 boards in his last five. Cousins had 20 points against the Nuggets in Sacramento's first victory of the season over a team with a winning record. "It just took time," said Cousins, averaging 12.8 points and 7.6 rebounds on the season. "We're a young team. We just really had to find our roles. Now things are a lot better." The Kings (8-25), winners of three of five after dropping 22 of 24, are 2-10 on the road. They'll try to take advantage of the Raptors (12-24), who have lost 13 of 17 but have beaten the Sacramento six straight times at Air Canada Centre, outscoring the Kings 111.3-94.3 in the last four. The Raptors had six players score in double figures Friday in Boston but lost 122-102. DeMar DeRozan scored a team-best 20 points and has averaged 23.0 in his last five games - 10.0 more than his average in his first 31 this season. Toronto, opening a three-game homestand, has dropped six of seven at Air Canada Centre. "If we compete against anybody, we have to do it for 48 minutes," guard Jose Calderon said. "We have to keep working and keep learning." Evans had 23 points, seven rebounds and five assists to lead the Kings to their second straight win over the Raptors on Nov. 1, 111-108. Andrea Bargnani led Toronto with 28 points in that game, and has averaged 23.5 points and 58.6 percent shooting in his last four against Sacramento. The Kings will try to avoid moving closer to matching their longest road losing streak of last season, 11 games from Jan. 1-Feb. 7, 2010. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
