Grizzlies-Warriors Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Mar 06 2012 5:24PM Memphis Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins was thrilled with how his team closed out its last game. There were similar feelings following a furious fourth-quarter rally in Oakland six weeks ago. Memphis goes for a fifth consecutive win overall and fifth in a row over the Golden State Warriors, who get back to work Wednesday night after a strong finish to their longest trip of the season. Down by one heading into the fourth quarter Saturday, the Grizzlies (22-15) shot 11 for 20 from the field and forced seven turnovers in the final 12 minutes of a 100-83 victory over Detroit. "It was just awesome," Hollins said after his team won for the 10th time in 12 games. "I thought we switched. We challenged shots. We got steals. Our energy level just rose." The same thing happened in the Grizzlies' game at Oracle Arena on Jan. 23. After trailing by 20 in the third quarter, Memphis outscored the Warriors 39-22 in the fourth to pull out a 91-90 victory. Rudy Gay scored three of his team-high 23 points in the final 23 seconds to help Memphis end a three-game road losing streak to Golden State, which suffered a season-high third consecutive home defeat. The Warriors (15-20) return to the Bay Area following a 3-3 trip that ended Monday with a 120-100 victory over Washington. Golden State shot 54.2 percent from the field, including a season-best 65.2 percent (15 of 23) from 3-point range in its highest-scoring game of 2011-12. The team shot 39.6 percent overall during the trip's first five games. "I wish they would have came a little bit earlier, but we're going to take this one, go home and see what happens," said Monta Ellis, who went 4 for 10 from long distance in the last two games after opening the trip 2 for 15 from beyond the arc. Ellis and Stephen Curry were both on target in the last game against Memphis, scoring 33 and 36 points, respectively, but the host Grizzlies won 104-103 on Feb. 18 when Tony Allen put back Gay's miss with 5.6 seconds left. Memphis' last defeat in this series was 115-109 in Oakland on Nov. 3, 2010, as Ellis scored 39. The Grizzlies could continue that run if their 3s keep falling. Memphis, which is shooting just 32.8 percent from beyond the arc, hit 5 of 6 from long range in the fourth quarter on Saturday, with O.J. Mayo knocking down three. It's 14-2 when it hits more than a third of its 3s. "We're not a big 3-point shooting team, but, believe it or not, we have 3-point shooters on this team," said point guard Mike Conley. "Our philosophy is so much inside-out that we just don't look to shoot the ball at the 3-point line." All-Star center Marc Gasol leads the Grizzlies with 18.8 points per game and 9.8 rebounds during the winning streak. He has totaled 32 points and 24 rebounds against Golden State in 2011-12. Warriors forward David Lee has scored 13.5 points per contest against Memphis, 5.7 lower than his season average. Curry has a team-high 54 points versus Memphis this season - one more than Ellis - but could be backing up Dominic McGuire for a second straight game. The third-year guard had 12 points in nine minutes off the bench Tuesday after a strained foot tendon limited him to three seconds over the previous four games.
