Kings-Rockets Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Dec 13 2010 8:55PM The Sacramento Kings were comfortable trading Kevin Martin to the Houston Rockets last season because of the development of Tyreke Evans. Lately, though, the Rockets appear to be getting the better end of the deal. Coming off a season-high 40-point effort, Martin will try to help the Rockets win their sixth straight at home Tuesday night when they face a Kings team that could be without the reigning rookie of the year. Martin, a former Kings first-round pick who led them in scoring three times, was part of a three-team deal Feb. 18 that sent Carl Landry to Sacramento. Since the swap, Martin is averaging 22.2 points in 47 games. He scored 32 in the first half and finished with 40 in Saturday's 110-95 victory over Cleveland. Martin's output in the opening 24 minutes was the third-most in a half in franchise history. "He came out at the very start and was very aggressive," said coach Rick Adelman, whose team will try to win six in a row at home for the first time since an 8-0 stretch that ended Jan. 15. "He made 3s, he got fouls, but when he passed the ball early in the game, he made two or three hard cuts. "That's something he's just got to continue to do. When he passes, he's got to make hard cuts, because he's so quick, it's going to give him the opportunity to get open." Martin's previous high with Houston (9-14) was 39 in a 117-107 victory over the Kings on April 12 in his first game in Sacramento since the deal. Kings coach Paul Westphal wishes Evans was making similar contributions. Bothered by an inflamed arch on his left foot, Evans is averaging 16.5 points - 3.6 fewer than in 2009-10 - and shooting 39.1 percent from the field. He has scored 13 points on 5-for-19 shooting in the last two games. "We're not really adjusting the offense but certainly it can't continue like it is," Westphal said after his team made 36.7 percent of its attempts in Saturday's 104-83 home loss to Miami. "We've either got to get Tyreke playing like he can play or do something else." Evans was scheduled to travel with the Kings (5-16) as they open a three-game trip, but if he can't go, Francisco Garcia will likely get the start. "When the star player goes out, they saw last year, they can turn it around," said Martin, referring to his two-month absence early last season when he was sidelined with a broken left wrist. "Other guys, they get a big smile on their face to see what they can do with the number of shots that will be given to them now." Martin wasn't smiling when the Rockets hosted Sacramento on March 3. Facing the Kings for the first time, he missed 10 of 13 shots and scored 14 as the Kings ended a six-game skid at Toyota Center with an 84-81 victory. Evans endured a 4-of-22 shooting performance and scored eight in that matchup, while Landry had 22 points with 10 rebounds. The Kings are averaging 85.0 points on 38.8 percent shooting during a five-game road skid. The Rockets are limiting opponents to 95.2 points - 9.7 fewer than their season average - and 45.2 percent shooting during their home winning streak. These team meet again in Sacramento on Sunday.
