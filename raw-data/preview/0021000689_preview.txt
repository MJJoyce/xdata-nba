Timberwolves-Jazz Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Jan 27 2011 4:32PM Returning to their home court couldn't help the Utah Jazz end their lengthy slide, but a visit from the lowly Minnesota Timberwolves might. The Jazz will try to snap a six-game losing streak Friday night when they welcome the Western Conference's worst team, which has dropped 10 of 11. After three straight victories earlier this month, Utah (27-19) went winless on its season-high, five-game road trip then fell 112-105 to the NBA's best team, San Antonio, on Wednesday night. Despite battling a sprained wrist, Deron Williams scored 17 of his season-best 39 points in the fourth quarter to help Utah cut a 10-point deficit to four with 22 seconds left. The Jazz, though, missed three consecutive 3-pointers after that, including two from Williams. "Our guys played much harder than they have been," coach Jerry Sloan said. "They put themselves in a position to have a chance to win. But again, you have to have a great finish." Sloan's team has averaged 93.8 points and allowed 108.2 per game during its longest skid since Dec. 4-14, 2007. During its previous 40 games, Utah averaged 101.0 points and allowed 98.4 per contest. In spite of those struggles, the Jazz would seem to have a good shot to avoid dropping seven in a row for the first time since a nine-game slide March 4-19, 2005. The Timberwolves (10-35) are 2-21 on the road this season and 7-57 there over the past two. Lately, they've struggled to win no matter where they have played. Minnesota had a chance for a rare victory Wednesday night but missed two late scoring opportunities in a 118-117 overtime loss to visiting Oklahoma City. Kevin Love, who had 31 points and 21 rebounds, had his hook shot rattle out near the end of regulation, and Luke Ridnour couldn't make a 3-pointer with two seconds left in the extra period. "We all played hard," said forward Michael Beasley, who scored 30 points. "We showed character and we showed heart." The Timberwolves also had a chance to beat the Jazz on Dec. 22 at home as they led by 15 late in the third quarter and by seven with 2:40 remaining. Utah, though, closed on an 18-6 run in a 112-107 victory. Williams had a team-best 25 points in that game, while Paul Millsap and former Minnesota player Al Jefferson scored 23 apiece. Love had 25 points and 19 rebounds as part of his current streak of 31 consecutive double-doubles - six shy of matching Kevin Garnett's team record. With the Jazz struggling on defense, the Timberwolves could provide some trouble as they've averaged 117.7 points in the past three games. However, they've also given up 124.3 per game to remain the league's worst defensive club (109.1). Minnesota has scored at least 100 points in eight straight meetings with Utah but has allowed the Jazz to top the century mark in all of those games and 16 of the past 18 matchups. The Timberwolves have dropped three in a row to their Northwest Division rivals but have won two of three in Utah. Millsap scored 21 to lead the Jazz to a 122-100 home victory over Minnesota on March 17. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
