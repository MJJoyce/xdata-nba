Warriors-Thunder Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Jan 17 2014 2:51AM The Oklahoma City Thunder and Golden State Warriors have split two meetings this season, and both were decided in the final second. Kevin Durant will try to continue his recent scoring surge Friday night and lift the Thunder to a 10th straight home win against the Warriors. Oklahoma City (29-10) has won its last nine at home against Golden State (25-15) by an average of 10.3 points, but the margin was as slim as could be Nov. 29. Russell Westbrook hit a 3 with 0.1 seconds left in overtime to give the Thunder a 113-112 victory. That dramatic ending came 15 days after Andre Iguodala connected on a fadeaway jumper along the baseline as time expired to give the Warriors a 116-115 home win. If there's another spectacular ending, it won't involve Westbrook, who is recovering from knee surgery and isn't expected back until after the All-Star break. Durant, meanwhile, has had a relatively rough two games versus Golden State this season. The league's leading scorer has totaled 45 points and 20 rebounds while making 34.4 percent from the floor - 2 for 8 from beyond the arc - in a combined 86 minutes against the Warriors. He's taken on an even larger role offensively since Westbrook has gone down, averaging 34.6 points as the Thunder have gone 6-5 without their point guard. Durant is only shooting 43.7 percent from the field in his last five games, but he's helping Oklahoma City by getting to the line. He's averaged 16.2 free-throw attempts in his last five games, and went 18 for 20 from the line and finished with 36 points in Thursday's 104-92 win at Houston. Reggie Jackson had 23 points while Serge Ibaka added 21 with 15 rebounds. "Kevin Durant is still as good as it gets," Warriors coach Mark Jackson said. "His ability to put everybody on his back. His ability to score, and make everybody a live weapon. We've gotta be able to contain and attempt to make him work. "We've gotta be aware of the other guys on the floor, but it's still a very good team that is very well coached and it's going to be tough for us." That may certainly be the case after the Thunder held the Rockets to a franchise-low 19 points in the second half. Houston missed all 14 3-pointers in the final 24 minutes after hitting 12 in the first half. "I've never seen anything like that," said coach Scott Brooks, who showed his team video of Houston's 3s at halftime. "That's inspiring." Golden State is fourth in the league from beyond the arc at 38.4 percent, but it's shooting 3s at just a 33.2 percent clip in its past eight games. The Warriors missed 19 of 28 3s while Denver hit 12 of 24 from long distance in a 123-116 home loss Wednesday, falling for the second time in three games following a season-high 10-game winning streak. It was just the fifth time in 25 games Golden State lost when its regulars - Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, David Lee and Andrew Bogut - are in the starting lineup. "It's scary to think how good we are when we click on all cylinders," Jackson said. Curry has been in a shooting slump lately, connecting on 36.1 percent from the field - 25.5 percent from 3-point range - in his last five games. He scored 32 with 11 rebounds and five assists at Oklahoma City in November after averaging 15.7 points over his three previous visits. The Warriors are expected to have Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks available after acquiring them in a trade from Boston earlier this week. Copyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
