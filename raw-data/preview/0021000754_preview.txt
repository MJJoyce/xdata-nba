Clippers-Heat Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 05 2011 10:30PM The Miami Heat's Big Three are starting to get healthy and have the offense clicking on all cylinders. Another impressive display might be in store against the road-weary Los Angeles Clippers. The Heat will look to avenge their loss to the Clippers from earlier this season as they try for a sixth consecutive win Sunday. One night after LeBron James scored a season-high 51 points in a 104-100 win at Orlando, Dwyane Wade stepped up Friday with his fourth career triple-double, recording 22 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists as Miami (36-14) defeated Charlotte 109-97 on the road. "Just the fact that they're sharing and scoring and rebounding and playing defense all at the same time, it shows how versatile they are," said Chris Bosh of his superstar teammates. Wade, who recently missed time due to a sprained wrist, nearly sat out against the Bobcats after falling awkwardly on his back against the Magic. Friday marked just the fourth time that he played alongside Bosh and James since James sprained his ankle in a 111-105 loss Jan. 12 at Los Angeles. James went on to miss the next two games while Bosh, who is averaging 26.1 points in his last 11 games against the Clippers, was held out Jan. 18-28 with a sprained ankle. The Heat lost four of their first five without their trio intact. But after escaping with an 88-87 win over Detroit on Jan. 28 without Bosh, they've shot 51.4 percent and averaged 109.5 points - 7.7 more than their season mark - over their last four victories with their three All-Stars healthy. Miami could be in line for another offensive outpouring against a Clippers team allowing an average of 107.8 points during its five-game road skid. "We're playing good basketball right now," said James, who had 19 points, nine assists and eight rebounds Friday. "We feel whole finally. Everyone is feeling confident that they can make a contribution right now. No one is worrying about playing time or stats. We just go out and play." The Clippers (19-30), meanwhile, began their season-high 11-game road trip with a disappointing loss at Atlanta on Friday night. With his team up one, Blake Griffin was called for a flagrant foul with 0.6 seconds remaining and Hawks center Al Horford made both free throws as Los Angeles fell 101-100. "It's tough to lose a game like that," Griffin, who had 19 points and 11 rebounds, told NBA.com. "It's one of those games where you just feel bad. With the way I played, I really didn't help my teammates tonight. I've got to do a better job." While Griffin recorded his 35th double-double in 36 games, the All-Star rookie was just 8 of 18 from the floor and also committed four turnovers. The Clippers outscored the Hawks 33-22 in the fourth quarter and nearly recorded their first road win since a 100-99 victory Dec. 27 at Sacramento, but they fell to 3-16 on the road. "I'm pleased with the effort, and if we do that (in the future), we'll be fine," said coach Vinny Del Negro. Baron Davis registered 22 points and 13 assists Friday and may need another big game if Los Angeles - still without leading scorer Eric Gordon - hopes to keep up with Miami. Gordon, averaging 24.1 points, scored 26 in the Jan. 12 win over the Heat but remains out with a wrist injury. The Clippers are 0-15 on the road when allowing 100 or more points. Miami is averaging 103.0 points at home. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
