Spurs-Timberwolves Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Nov 23 2010 9:45PM The San Antonio Spurs have lost one game all season and that came nearly a month ago. Their next opponent isn't likely to slow them down either. The NBA-leading Spurs look to extend their own winning streak to 12 and make it 13 straight wins over the Minnesota Timberwolves when the teams meet at the Target Center on Wednesday night. San Antonio (12-1) is off to the best start in franchise history, winning 11 in row since losing to New Orleans on Oct. 30. A victory Wednesday would give the Spurs their first 12-game streak since a 13-game run Feb. 13-March 13, 2007. A potent offense has played a big part in San Antonio's success. The team ranks second in the league, averaging 107.6 points per game, but has also stepped up its play on the defensive end lately, holding opponents to 93.5 points over the last eight games. Manu Ginobili, who leads the team in scoring with 20.4 points per game, knows there is still a lot of work to be done. "It's too early to tell. What we know we're winning games that last year we would have lost," Ginobili said. "But it's too early. Thirteen games so far. We've got a long way to go." The Spurs looked like championship contenders in their 106-97 win over Orlando on Monday night as they shot a season-best 63.2 (12 for 19) percent from 3-point range. San Antonio is knocking down 3-pointers at an NBA-best 44.4 percent clip, and has received an extra boost from Matt Bonner, who went 4 for 4 from beyond the arc versus the Magic. "We wanted to give the fans their money's worth," he said. Bonner missed six games with a sprained ankle but has gone 18 for 26 (69.2 percent) from long distance since his return. While the Spurs' offense seems to be clicking on all cylinders, 12-time All Star and two-time MVP Tim Duncan is averaging a career-low 13.8 points in just 28.9 minutes per game. Despite the lack of production, Duncan's teammates aren't concerned. "Timmy's taking a little bit of the back seat so we can save him for the playoffs," said Tony Parker, who is averaging a career-best 7.8 assists. Parker matched a season high with 24 points and distributed 10 assists Monday and is likely looking forward to the trip to Minnesota, where he recorded a career-high 55 points Nov. 5, 2008. The Timberwolves (4-11) will be looking for their first win over the Spurs since Jan. 3, 2007, and have lost the last three meetings by at least 18 points. San Antonio could be in line for a big offensive night with the Timberwolves ranking second-to-last in field-goal percentage (42.2) and last in scoring defense (110.4). Minnesota lost for the fourth time in five games Monday, falling to Oklahoma City 117-107 despite strong performances from Kevin Love and Darko Milicic. Love, averaging an league-best 14.0 rebounds, had 24 points and 17 boards while Milicic, the forgotten second-overall pick from the 2003 draft, scored 21. Milicic, now on his fifth team in eight years, is averaging 5.7 points over his career, but with back-to-back 20-point efforts, may have found a home in Minnesota. "He's making great shots. He's getting himself integrated into the offense really well," said Love. "Blocking a ton of shots, getting rebounds. We're happy for him." Love, limited to 10.8 points per game against the Spurs over his career, remains confident despite his team's poor record. "We just need to execute down the stretch a little bit better, and be put in those situations and eventually we'll grow up and we'll learn from them," he said.
