Warriors-Trail Blazers Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Apr 10 2012 3:45PM Coming off their most lopsided defeat in five seasons, the deflated Golden State Warriors seem to have hit rock bottom. While the Portland Trail Blazers' recent efforts also have left much to be desired, they don't appear ready to throw in the towel just yet. The visiting Warriors try to avoid a ninth loss in 11 games Wednesday night and a third consecutive defeat to the Trail Blazers, who could be missing LaMarcus Aldridge. The All-Star forward flew to Colorado to have his sore right hip examined, leaving his status for this game questionable. Aldridge had an MRI on the hip last month, but the results were negative. Golden State (22-34) also was in Colorado on Monday, losing 123-84 to Denver two nights after winning 112-97 at Oakland in the front end of that home-and-home set. The Warriors were outscored 37-13 in the opening quarter Monday, outrebounded 60-27 and outscored 70-18 in the paint. "(Monday) was about as bad as we could play as a team," said David Lee, who shot 4 of 15 and scored 10 points after averaging 25.1 in his previous eight games. "... It was just one of those days where when you play an 82, or in this case a 66-game season, it's going to happen. It's the unfortunate part of being in the NBA is nights like this. It's one of the worst feelings in the world." Klay Thompson had 17 points while Nate Robinson scored 16 for the Warriors, who shot 36.9 percent en route to their worst loss since falling 129-89 at San Antonio on Dec. 4, 2006. "It's terrible. This one should really hurt us and motivate us to finish strong," Thompson said. Sitting in 11th place in the Western Conference, Portland (27-31) is coming off Monday's 94-89 loss to Houston. Aldridge had 20 points and former Warrior Jamal Crawford scored 18 for the Trail Blazers, whose 9-15 record since the All-Star break is eighth-worst in the NBA. "It's getting closer and closer," Aldridge said of the point when the Blazers can rule out the postseason. "But we've got to keep working, keep getting better and continue to build." Portland won 11 of its first 12 home games while allowing an average of 89.3 points, but has since given up 98.7 per contest while dropping 10 of 18 at the Rose Garden. "We have to get it done on the defensive end of the floor, not the offensive end of the floor," interim coach Kaleb Canales told the team's official website. The Blazers had dropped four straight to Golden State before taking the two most recent matchups by a combined five points, including a 90-87 home win March 25 behind 24 points from Raymond Felton. The Warriors have lost six of eight in Portland. While Golden State continues to play without Stephen Curry (sprained right ankle), Portland could be short-handed again with Nicolas Batum's status uncertain. Batum (left quad) was held out Monday and is listed as day-to-day. Aldridge is averaging 15.6 points lifetime against the Warriors - his third-lowest mark against any opponent.
