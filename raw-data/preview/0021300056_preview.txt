Lakers-Mavericks Preview By KEVIN CHROUST Posted Nov 04 2013 11:32PM Winning in Dallas has become routine for the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers have gone an NBA-best 8-2 at American Airlines Center since March 18, 2008, while the Mavericks have a .691 home winning percentage in that time (143-64). Los Angeles goes for its sixth straight regular-season win in Dallas on Tuesday night. The Mavericks haven't cracked 100 points during their five-game home skid against the Lakers, which dates to March 12, 2011. They've averaged 101.1 in all home games since then, but the Lakers have held them to 92.6, winning by an average of 11.2 points. Kobe Bryant played in all of those games. Continuing the road streak will have to happen without him while he continues to recover from a torn left Achilles. The Lakers have gone 2-2 without their star guard after snapping a two-game skid with a 105-103 home win over Atlanta on Sunday. Pau Gasol hit a pair of free throws with 6 seconds left to secure the win. Xavier Henry made his first start of the season and scored a team-high 18 points as the Lakers continue to look for the right rotation without Bryant. Henry scored a game-high 22 points off the bench in their season-opening win over the Los Angeles Clippers on Oct. 29, but has been held to 4-of-17 shooting in their losses. "We're still trying to find the right combinations and rack up the wins while we do it," Henry said. "We have a lot of new guys, and a lot of guys still need to learn how to play with each other. We're trying new lineups and stuff, so we're still going to be working and trying to compete." Henry is averaging 14.3 points through four games, second on the team behind Gasol's 15.8. They have eight players averaging at least 7.0 points. They've also had to figure out how to replace their leading rebounder from a year ago. Dwight Howard's 12.4 per game are gone, but the Lakers have an even rebounding margin (190-190) and are averaging 47.5 per game after finishing 2012-13 at 44.8. The Lakers went 3-1 against Dallas last season, outrebounding them in each game. The Mavericks (2-1) are averaging 111.3 points after Saturday's 111-99 home win over Memphis. They're shooting only 38.9 percent in their last two games, but they made up for it against the Grizzlies with a 40-for-46 night at the free throw line. Six players reached double figures, led by Dirk Nowitzki's 24. Nowitzki and newcomer Monta Ellis are each averaging 23.3 points through their first three games together. The scoring hasn't necessarily made for blowout wins. They're allowing 107.0 points per game after giving up 101.7 in 2012-13, which was 27th in the league. "We can score the ball like we should, but we've got to play defense, too," said Shawn Marion, who had 21 points and 14 rebounds against the Grizzlies. In addition to their road success against Dallas, the Lakers have won seven of the last eight overall in the series. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
