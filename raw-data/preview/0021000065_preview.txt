The Kings might not be as fortunate if they fall too far behind their next opponent. Trying to match their best start in nine seasons, Sacramento will attempt to hand the rival Los Angeles Lakers their first loss of the season Wednesday night at Arco Arena. The Kings trailed by 16 points on Saturday in Cleveland but outscored the Cavaliers 31-15 in the third quarter en route to a 107-104 win. They overcame the same margin in the final two quarters of Monday's home opener against Toronto in a 111-108 victory. Battling an aching stomach that caused him to leave briefly, Tyreke Evans finished with 23 points and DeMarcus Cousins had 10 of his 16 in the final seven minutes. "That was a really exciting game," coach Paul Westphal said. "I'm so happy for our guys. I don't want to have to come back every game like this, but it's nice to know we can." The Kings (3-1) haven't won four of their first five games since 2001-02, but could have a difficult time pulling off that feat against the reigning two-time champions. The Lakers (4-0) are also leading the NBA with 114.3 points per game and coming off their highest-scoring game of the season. Los Angeles also shot a season-best 51.2 percent in Tuesday night's 124-105 win over visiting Memphis. Kobe Bryant scored all of his 23 points in the first half as his team remained one of three unbeaten clubs in the NBA. Pau Gasol, who holds a slight scoring lead over his All-Star teammate (24.3 to 23.8 ppg), had 21 points and a season-high 13 rebounds. The Lakers bench also accounted for 50 points, scoring much of that while some of the team's starters rested in the final period. "Our starters can't do everything," said swingman Shannon Brown, who scored 13 points Tuesday. "The bench players are going to have to continue to come out and bring energy and do what is needed for us to win." Those offensive fireworks could continue Wednesday, as the Lakers have surpassed 100 points in 16 consecutive games against Sacramento, averaging 114.8 while winning 13 of those matchups. Los Angeles has also scored at least 106 points in each of its six consecutive victories against its Pacific Division rival, but coach Phil Jackson doesn't expect to have it easy. "They have just come off a really big win coming back from a deficit in the fourth quarter, beating Toronto, so they have a lot of enthusiasm up there," Jackson said. "They're playing with some confidence, I think that's the biggest part." Bryant has averaged 32.2 points while playing in five victories during the streak, while Gasol has averaged 23.5 in the six wins. The Lakers have also won their last three at Sacramento and seven of eight there. Bryant sealed a double-overtime win there last December with a pair of 3-pointers late. Evans had 25 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists in that game and averaged 21.5 points in his first two games against the Lakers. However, early foul trouble before a third-quarter ejection for arguing limited him to 10 points in last season's finale, a 106-100 loss at the Staples Center.
