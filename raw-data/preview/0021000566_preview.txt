Spurs-Bucks Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Jan 12 2011 12:41AM An unexpected extra day off might help the Milwaukee Bucks in their preparation to face the team with NBA's best record. The Bucks look to win consecutive games for the first time in almost three weeks while trying to avoid a fourth consecutive loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night at the Bradley Center. Milwaukee (14-21) must wait an extra day to build on its latest victory after Tuesday's game at Atlanta was postponed due to the winter storm that hit the area. The Bucks, who snapped a three-game skid with a 115-92 win at New Jersey on Saturday, planned to arrive back in Milwaukee late Tuesday and be ready to face San Antonio (32-6) as scheduled. With an added off day, the Bucks could be a little fresher while trying to post consecutive wins for the first time since Dec. 21-23. That extra day also may help center Andrew Bogut return to the lineup after missing Saturday's contest with a viral infection. Bogut had 12 points and a career-high 27 rebounds in Friday's 101-95 overtime loss to Miami. Against the Nets, Chris Douglas-Roberts scored 18 of his 24 points in the second half while Ersan Ilyasova posted a season-high 22 with 13 rebounds as the NBA's worst-shooting team at 41.8 percent shot a season-high 58.3 percent. "We knew how important this game was to us," said Douglas-Roberts, who scored 30 against the Heat. "We need to win these kinds of games." The Bucks also could use a victory over one of the NBA's elite clubs while capping a tough string of home games. In its last four home contests, Milwaukee lost to Utah and Atlanta, then beat Dallas before falling to Miami. Douglas-Roberts scored 21 points in a 92-90 loss at San Antonio on Dec. 15. Manu Ginobili hit a fadeaway at the buzzer for the game-winner. Ginobili scored 19 points and Tony Parker added 12 with 13 assists Tuesday to give San Antonio a third straight victory, 107-96 at Minnesota. Though the Spurs won for the 17th time in 20 games, they are not content despite holding the Timberwolves to 37.8 percent shooting and their third straight opponent to fewer than 97 points. "I think we are at the point where we are more looking toward improving more than beating the Wolves," Ginobili told the Spurs' official website. "I don't think we got any better." Ginobili is averaging 22.3 points in the last four games. He had 26 against the Bucks last month but has averaged 13.5 in six career games at the Bradley Center. Ginobili did score 30 points in the Spurs' 96-94 win at Milwaukee on March 1, 2008. San Antonio has averaged 105.3 points on 54.5 percent shooting during its three-game winning streak against the Bucks. While Bogut is likely to return for this contest, Milwaukee will remain without leading scorer Brandon Jennings (17.9 points per game) for an 11th straight game due to a broken foot. Carlos Delfino, who has not played since Nov. 6, is nearing a return but remains out for the Bucks with concussion-like symptoms. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
