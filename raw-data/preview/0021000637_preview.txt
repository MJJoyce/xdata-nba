Lakers-Nuggets Preview By BRETT HUSTON Posted Jan 20 2011 3:03PM Kobe Bryant was concerned about the Los Angeles Lakers' defense in their latest loss. In their recent visits to Denver, they've had the opposite problem. Dreadful shooting has plagued the Lakers in four straight regular-season defeats in Denver, a streak they'll try to end Friday night against a Nuggets team that's won four of five despite the ongoing swirl of speculation surrounding Carmelo Anthony. The Lakers (31-13) shot 55.6 percent and scored 56 points in the first half Wednesday at Dallas, but they couldn't hold a four-point lead. The Mavericks shot 57.1 percent after the break and outscored Los Angeles 57-44 in a 109-100 win. "We were making mistakes all night on defense, because offensively things were going well for us," said Bryant, who finished with 21 points and 10 assists. "It was one of those games that was fool's gold. We were playing well offensively and got a lead, but we were making mistakes defensively." When the Lakers have visited Denver (24-17) recently, it's been their inability to knock down shots that's cost them. Los Angeles has shot 35.5 percent during four straight regular-season losses at the Pepsi Center, though they shot 48.0 percent in going 2-1 there in the 2009 Western Conference finals. Bryant and Lamar Odom have struggled the most. Bryant has played in three of the losses, shooting 35.0 percent while averaging 26.7 shots, while Odom's shot a woeful 29.3 percent and averaged 8.5 points in all four. Bryant had 34 points in a 118-112 loss in Denver on Nov. 11, but went 11 for 32. Anthony led the way for the Nuggets with 32 points, shooting 14 of 25. When Bryant's taking a lot of shots, the Lakers typically aren't successful. They're 8-16 over the past four seasons when Bryant's attempted at least 30 shots. This season, Los Angeles is 8-8 when he shoots it 21 or more times and 23-5 when he takes 20 or fewer. The Nuggets, meanwhile, fare better when Anthony's getting plenty of looks. They're 11-5 when he takes 20 or more shots and 10-8 when he's attempted 19 or fewer. It's anyone's guess how many more shots Anthony will take in a Denver uniform, but he didn't look fazed Wednesday against Oklahoma City. Hours after Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov announced he was ending his team's pursuit of the three-time All-Star, Anthony bounced back from consecutive 12-point games with 35 in a 112-107 win, making 12 of 25 shots. "It was personal. I wanted to get it going early for myself and my team," Anthony said. "I'm still here, I'm still playing. I'm still a Denver Nugget. I still have games to play." That's not exactly what Nuggets fans are hoping to hear. Many Nuggets fans booed Anthony despite his role in the victory. "At this point," Anthony said, "I don't expect any cheers." Denver's making it difficult not to cheer lately despite the constant melodrama surrounding Anthony. The Nuggets have averaged 125.3 points in their last four home games, shooting 54.6 percent. Seven players have averaged double figures in that stretch, including Arron Afflalo at 18.0. Denver has averaged 42.5 points in the paint during their home streak against the Lakers. That's 9.0 per game more than Los Angeles despite the Nuggets being outrebounded by 6.2 per contest. Lakers center Andrew Bynum, who's missed three of the past four visits to Denver, hyperextended his right elbow Wednesday but expects to play Friday. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
