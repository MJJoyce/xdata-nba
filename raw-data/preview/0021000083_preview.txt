A franchise-best start under first-year coach Monty Williams has helped the Hornets steal some of that spotlight. After an attention-getting victory, New Orleans will try to further its unbeaten start by topping the Milwaukee Bucks for the second time this season Saturday night at the Bradley Center. After missing the playoffs last season, the Hornets were hoping to improve with star guard Chris Paul healthy. At 5-0, New Orleans is well on its way to leaving that 37-45 finish behind, especially after its latest win. On Friday night, the Hornets became the second team to take down the well-hyped Miami Heat as Trevor Ariza hit a key 3-pointer with 14 seconds left. Emeka Okafor had a season-high 26 points and 13 rebounds in the 96-93 victory, and Paul contributed a season-best 19 assists to go with his 13 points. "It's nice to be part of a group who plays hard every night," Williams said. "Different guys are stepping up." The Hornets will try to follow up that performance by continuing their recent success against the Bucks (2-4). A 95-91 victory in the season opener Oct. 27 was New Orleans' ninth in 10 games against Milwaukee. The Hornets have also won three of four at the Bradley Center but that lone defeat came in their most recent trip there Feb. 24. Paul, who played a career-low 45 games in 2009-10, missed both games against the Bucks last season. While the Hornets will try to keep rolling, the Bucks will attempt to build off Friday night's comeback for their second win this season, 94-90 at Indiana. After giving up 40 points in the second quarter, Milwaukee overcame an eight-point halftime deficit and outscored the Pacers 42-30 in the second half. "It was a big win for us," said guard John Salmons, who scored 22 points. "We started off a little slow, but we're gradually getting better." Brandon Jennings added 18 points but his shooting struggles have continued into his second NBA season. Jennings missed 12 of 19 attempts Friday, leaving him at 38.2 percent. That's a slight improvement from his rookie campaign when he shot just 37.1 percent. He's averaging 14.7 points this season after scoring 15.5 per game in 2009-10. "Instead of me just trying to figure out everybody else's game and trying to set back for other people on the team, I'm just going to have to play like I played last year, and that's just be more aggressive," Jennings said. "Take shots, and hey, if I miss them, I miss them. If I make shots, that opens up things for everybody else." Against the Hornets, Jennings has been held to 12.7 points on 32.5 percent shooting. West, meanwhile, has averaged 22.8 points and 11.1 rebounds in his last 11 games against Milwaukee. Bucks center Andrew Bogut is questionable for this game. Bogut, who had 15 points and 15 rebounds in the season opener, sat out Friday's win due to a migraine. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
