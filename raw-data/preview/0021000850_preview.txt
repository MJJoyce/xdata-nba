Continuing that solid play coming out of the All-Star break may not be a difficult task at all. The 76ers seek their fourth win in five games Wednesday night when they meet the woeful Washington Wizards for the final time in 2010-11. Philadelphia lost 13 of its first 16 with two of those defeats coming against Washington (15-40), both in overtime and by a combined three points. On Jan. 20, the 76ers were eight games below .500 and outside the top eight in the Eastern Conference. They've since gone 10-4 - a stretch highlighted by home wins over league-leading San Antonio, Denver and Utah, and a 34-point victory in Atlanta. "We have to start believing that we're a really good team," forward Andre Iguodala said. "... We've shown that we can compete with anybody. We've just got to stay consistent and beat the teams we're supposed to (beat). That's the biggest thing." Philadelphia entered the break following a 114-105 win at Houston last Wednesday. Jrue Holiday had 20 points to lead seven Sixers in double figures, and Iguodala recorded 13 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his first triple-double since March 7, 2007. With its next victory, Philadelphia (27-29) will exceed last season's total, and the 76ers will now begin a favorable stretch of schedule that could move them further up the East ladder. After Washington, Philadelphia will play Detroit and Cleveland to close February. "We've got our minds on something else, and that's the playoffs," Holiday said. "To start off 3-13 and kick butt from there on, it's great for us." Keys to Philadelphia's recent success have been the overall play of Elton Brand and long-range shooting by Louis Williams and Jodie Meeks. Over the last 14 games, Brand has shot 55.0 percent from the floor while averaging team highs of 16.6 points and 8.8 rebounds. Williams has gone 22 of 51 from beyond the arc and is second with 15.9 points per game in that span, while Meeks has drained a club-best 27 3-pointers. The 76ers are in position to split this season series after a 109-97 home win over Washington on Jan. 5 behind 26 points each from Holiday and Williams. Philadelphia has taken 15 of the last 20 home meetings with the Wizards. After alternating wins and losses over its last four games before the break, Washington fell 113-96 on Tuesday at home to Indiana. Andray Blatche scored 21 points, Nick Young added 16 and John Wall chipped in 15 with 10 assists, but also had six turnovers. "Guys didn't bring no effort," Blatche said. "...For a minute out there, it seems like guys didn't care after a while - like we just gave in to a team that we're definitely much better than them if we compete. But nobody brought heart with them." Washington has dropped two straight by an average of 21.0 points after snapping a 25-game road losing streak Feb. 13 against NBA-worst Cleveland. Wall has played well against Philadelphia in his brief career. In three games, he's tallied 72 points, 33 assists and 11 steals - all his most against any opponent. Center JaVale McGee is averaging a double-double - 10.3 points and 10.0 rebounds - versus Philadelphia this season. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
