Hawks-Mavericks Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Jan 29 2011 1:19AM Dirk Nowitzki still isn't fully healthy, but the Dallas Mavericks are winning partly thanks to an unlikely source. With their best player still working himself into shape, the Mavericks may need another strong effort from Jose Juan Barea as they attempt to run their winning streak to four against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night. Nowitzki missed nine games with a sore right knee, and is still trying to re-establish himself through seven games. The star forward is averaging 19.0 points in that span, a drop from his team-leading 23.1 season average. He scored 18 points in a 111-106 win over Houston on Thursday, but stated that he's still struggling physically. "Not very well, but it's getting better," Nowitzki said of his conditioning. "Moving better again, especially in the first half, but in the second half I got a little fatigued. But I've got to keep on fighting, and eventually I'll get there." While Nowitzki attempts to regain his form and fitness, Dallas (30-15) has won four of five and three in a row with help from Barea. Though he is averaging a career-high 8.5 points as a reserve, Barea scored 19 points Thursday after getting 25 in a 112-105 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday. He's made 17 of 22 shots in those two games. "Everybody has to step up," said Barea, averaging 6.7 points during his four-plus seasons with the Mavericks. "There's no question he's not even close to being Dirk Nowitzki. We've got to keep getting wins and giving him some time." Tyson Chandler is also helping to pick up some of the slack. The center is averaging 20.3 points during the winning streak, more than doubling his season average of 9.9. He leads the team with 9.1 rebounds per game, and grabbed 15 while scoring 21 points for a second consecutive contest against the Rockets. A meeting with Atlanta (30-17) might get Nowitzki untracked. He's averaging 26.9 points over the last 10 matchups, but struggled to get to 21 points in a 98-93 road victory Nov. 20, making 8 of 22 field goals. Barea and Chandler combined for 13 points in that meeting. Dallas has won 10 of 12 at home against Atlanta, but lost 80-75 in the most recent matchup at American Airlines Center on Dec. 5, 2009, ending its five-game home winning streak in the series. The Hawks enter this meeting with some momentum after beating New York 111-102 on Friday after their six-game road winning streak ended with Wednesday's 98-90 loss to Milwaukee. Joe Johnson has been somewhat erratic of late, scoring at least 30 points in four of the last seven games, including 34 against the Knicks. However, the swingman has scored under 20 points in the other three games in that stretch. He leads the team with 19.9 points per game. Atlanta might be awaiting word from the NBA concerning an altercation between Marvin Williams and New York's Shawne Williams, as the two were ejected with a technical foul and another for fighting Friday. Marvin Williams, averaging 10.8 points, has been called for only 10 technical fouls in six seasons, none in 2010-11 until Friday. He'd been ejected only once before in a loss at Sacramento on Dec. 10, 2006. "I've never seen him snap like that," coach Larry Drew. 'It's an emotional game. Sometimes these things happen. Hopefully whatever the penalty is, it won't be too severe." Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
