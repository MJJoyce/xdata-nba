Raptors-Timberwolves Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 29 2011 2:47AM Minnesota is in position to match its longest losing streak of the season. Though the Toronto Raptors are also struggling, they've had no problem beating the Timberwolves for more than seven years. Looking to avoid its seventh straight loss, Minnesota will try to snap a 12-game losing streak to the Raptors when the last-place clubs meet Saturday night at the Target Center. Minnesota (10-36), at the bottom of the Northwest Division, returns home following a 108-100 defeat to Utah on Friday despite another strong effort from Kevin Love. Love, who is the only player averaging at least 20.0 points and 15.0 rebounds, recorded 22 and 15 for his NBA-best 32nd straight double-double. He is averaging 23.4 points and 16.6 rebounds over that span. "..We still had our chances, but in the end they were a little too much," said Love, who has registered only 15.3 points and 7.3 rebounds in four career games against the Raptors (13-34). Wesley Johnson came through with another impressive effort, coming off the bench to score 19 points. Johnson, picked fourth overall in the 2010 draft, is averaging 17.0 points on 54.1 percent shooting in his last three games. The Timberwolves are allowing an NBA-worst 109.0 points per game, but they've surrendered 117.0 during the current skid. They could, however, be in line for a breakout defensive performance against the Raptors, who have scored just 91.3 points while losing six straight on the road, The Timberwolves are 6-0 at home when giving up fewer than 100 points. Minnesota, which last defeated the Raptors on Jan. 21, 2004, has been outscored by 10.5 points in 12 meetings since then. Toronto dropped its 10th straight overall after falling 116-110 in overtime to Milwaukee on Friday. DeMar DeRozan, who had recorded 25.2 points over his previous six games, finished with 11 while Andrea Bargnani went 9 of 23 from the floor - including 0 of 5 from 3-point range. Bargnani, averaging a team-best 21.5 points, still scored 23. He had a chance to win the game but missed a jumper as time expired in regulation. "It's tough, our best guys didn't have very good games tonight," Raptors coach Jay Triano said. "DeMar and Andrea struggled a little bit tonight and that's going to happen sometimes." Amir Johnson picked up some of the slack with a season-high 24 points and 12 rebounds. Johnson, averaging a career-high 9.8 points this season, is scoring 14.8 on 74.4 percent shooting over the last five games. Toronto, which is last in the Atlantic, hasn't dropped 11 straight since a 12-game skid from Dec. 18, 2002-Jan. 10, 2003. That losing streak ended with a 14-point win over Minnesota.
