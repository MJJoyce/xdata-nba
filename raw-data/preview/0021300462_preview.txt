Warriors-Magic Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Dec 30 2013 2:05PM While Stephen Curry is struggling to find consistency with his shot, he's coming through in different ways to help the Golden State Warriors extend their winning streak. Now he'll try to lead them to a victory in Orlando for the first time in his career. Golden State looks to win six in a row for the first time in six years while the Magic attempt to match their longest winning streak of the season Tuesday night. Although he endured another rough shooting stretch, Curry had 29 points along with 11 assists and nine rebounds in a 108-104 overtime victory at Cleveland on Sunday. It was nearly a second straight triple-double for Curry, who notched the third of his career Friday against Phoenix as he had 14 points on 5-of-17 shooting with 16 assists and 13 boards. The star guard missed 10 of 11 shots in the second half and overtime Sunday before sinking a clutch jumper with 13.5 seconds left as the Warriors (19-13) opened a seven-game road trip with their fifth straight victory. He finished 10 for 23 from the field with five 3-pointers as Golden State rallied from a 17-point deficit. Curry averaged just 15.3 points on 31.7 percent shooting in the previous four games, but he's contributed in other ways during the win streak with 11.0 assists and 7.4 boards per game. The Warriors are 12-2 when he has at least 10 assists and just 2-5 when he scores 30 or more. "I love the fact he's picking and choosing when to facilitate, when to score," coach Mark Jackson said. "He's scoring the basketball but even more impressive is he's second in the league in assists (9.6 per game)." Curry has endured some cold streaks in Orlando, averaging 16.3 points on 36.4 percent shooting in three career visits. The Warriors have lost four straight there by an average of 23.3 points and have dropped eight of nine overall in the series. Golden State, however, is 4-1 versus Eastern Conference opponents this season and looking to win six straight overall for the first time since Nov. 23-Dec. 2, 2007. Southeast Division-worst Orlando (10-20) hopes to end an eight-game skid against West teams while matching a season high with its third straight victory. Arron Afflalo, averaging a team-high 21.9 points, overcame a sore ankle to lead seven players in double figures with 21 points in Sunday's 109-102 win over visiting Atlanta. Rookie Victor Oladipo has totaled 31 points, 19 assists and 10 rebounds in the last two victories after a four-game stretch in which the No. 2 overall pick averaged 6.5 points on 24.4 percent shooting. "He's pretty impressive and he's just starting this thing," coach Jacque Vaughn said. "You get a pulse from him and a sense from him that he wants to do something special." Tobias Harris and Nikola Vucevic also have been key contributors. Harris has averaged 17.0 points and 7.0 rebounds in his last four games, and Vucevic has posted three straight double-doubles with averages of 16.7 and 12.3, respectively. Vucevic totaled 26 points and 32 boards in last season's two-game sweep of the Warriors. The Magic have shot 54.1 percent from the field while putting up 109 points in each of their last two games. They may have to continue that kind of production against Golden State, which has scored 110.8 per game versus East foes. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
