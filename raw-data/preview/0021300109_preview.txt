Pistons-Warriors Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Nov 12 2013 2:11AM Although Stephen Curry wasn't able to lead Golden State to a win in his return, he might be able to help the Warriors pull out of their offensive funk against the Detroit Pistons. The Warriors hope to get back on track at home Tuesday night when they seek their fifth straight win over the defensively challenged Pistons. Golden State (4-3) averaged 110.8 points on 50.2 percent shooting - including 45.9 percent from 3-point range - while winning four of five to open the season. But Curry sustained a left foot bruise in Wednesday's 106-93 win at Minnesota, and the Warriors shot a season-low 40.8 percent from the field with their star sidelined in a 76-74 loss at San Antonio on Friday. Curry finished with a team-high 22 points and hit 4 of 10 from 3-point range in his return Saturday. Golden State, though, managed just 40 second-half points and shot 42.3 percent overall in a 108-90 loss at Memphis. "We didn't execute," coach Mark Jackson said. "They were the more physical team, and it's just a disappointing loss for us." Since averaging 24.0 points while hitting 57.9 percent and 19 of 34 from beyond the arc in his first five games, backcourt mate Klay Thompson has totaled 23 points on 34.5 percent shooting and missed 10 of 13 3-point attempts in his last two. After splitting the four games on their road trip, the Warriors return home looking for improved efficiency and their third straight win in Oakland. They might be able to find some better looks against the Pistons (2-4), who have allowed an average of 109.0 points over a three-game losing streak. Detroit will try to end that skid with its first win at Golden State since Nov. 13, 2008. Curry totaled 53 points while sinking 9 of 13 from 3-point range and added 18 assists to help Golden State take both games from the Pistons last season. Teammate David Lee had a combined 40 points on 16-of-25 shooting with 26 boards in last year's season series. He's looking to get back on track in this meeting after totaling 26 points in his last two games. Detroit's Brandon Jennings finished with a season-high 28 points as Detroit opened its four-game road trip with a 109-103 loss at Portland on Monday. Greg Monroe added 19 and eight rebounds, while Andre Drummond had 16 and 16. "We've got a tough one (against the Warriors)," Jennings told the team's official website. "Another team that likes to shoot a lot of 3s. It's going to be even tougher." While with Milwaukee last season, Jennings put up 51 points, 17 assists and made 11 of 19 from beyond the arc in a pair of victories against Golden State. Rodney Stuckey had 13 points on 4-of-15 shooting Monday, but he's looking to continue his strong play against the Warriors. He finished with 17 points in a 104-97 loss in Detroit on Dec. 5 before scoring a team-high 22 in a 105-97 defeat in the most recent meeting in Oakland on March 13. Monroe, averaging team high of 18.0 points and 11.2 rebounds, leads a Detroit team that leads the NBA with 52.0 paint points per game after outscoring the Trail Blazers 60-36. They'll attempt to take advantage of a Golden State team that was outscored 54-18 in the paint and outrebounded 44-33 by the Grizzlies. Detroit has dropped 13 of 16 road games dating back to last season. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
