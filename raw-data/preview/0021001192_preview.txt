Timberwolves-Nuggets Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Apr 09 2011 12:45AM The Denver Nuggets will not host a first-round playoff series. However, a matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves should help Denver move closer to clinching the fifth seed in the Western Conference standings. The Nuggets go for their sixth straight victory in this Northwest Division matchup Saturday night when the teams meet in Denver. Needing a victory at Oklahoma City on Friday to all but clinch the fifth spot, the Nuggets (48-31) lost for just the second time in nine games, 104-89. Denver had its season high-tying 10-game home winning streak snapped by Oklahoma City on Tuesday with a 101-94 loss. "We had a lapse tonight but we've got to get it together," Nuggets point guard Raymond Felton said Friday after scoring 17 points off the bench. "With three games left, the playoffs coming up, we've got to figure this thing out. It's possible that's the same team we'll be playing." While the Nuggets can't control the Thunder from catching third-place Dallas, coach George Karl's team is nearly locked into the fifth spot, leading Portland by 1 1/2 games and New Orleans by two for that position. Denver has a good chance of extending that lead with a matchup against the lowly Timberwolves (17-62). Minnesota has dropped 12 straight since a 122-101 victory over Utah on March 11 and is tied with Cleveland for the NBA's worst record. "I feel bad for our guys," coach Kurt Rambis said following Wednesday's 108-98 home loss to Phoenix. "It's very hard emotionally on the players to go through a season like this." The Timberwolves, losers of nine straight on the road, last dropped 13 in a row during a 16-game skid Feb. 24-March 28, 2010. Minnesota could move closer to that mark if Kevin Love misses his fourth straight game with a groin injury. The All-Star forward, averaging career highs with 20.2 points and a league-best 15.2 rebounds, has been sidelined six of the last eight contests with the injury. The Nuggets likely wouldn't mind if Love took more time to recuperate. He is averaging 29.0 points and 16.7 rebounds in three games against the Nuggets this season. Love had a career-high 43 points with 17 boards in the teams' only meeting in Denver in 2010-11, a 115-113 Nuggets victory Dec. 18. Denver has its own injury problems, with Arron Afflalo (hamstring) missing 11 of the last 13 games, Chris Andersen (ankle) out the last four and rookie center Timofey Mozgov (ankle, knee) sidelined the last two. "I think having some extra bodies, healthier bodies, would probably help us a little bit, too," said Karl, whose team leads the league with 107.1 points per game but has been held under 100 in four of its last five. Even with a short bench, Karl should have more than enough offense against a Timberwolves team allowing a league-worst 106.9 points per game. Denver is averaging a league-high 110.7 points at home. The Nuggets have won 15 of 16 overall against the Timberwolves. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
