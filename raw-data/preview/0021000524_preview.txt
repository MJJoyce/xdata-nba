Nuggets-Kings Preview By BRETT HUSTON Posted Jan 06 2011 2:51AM One night after having their four-game winning streak snapped by one of the Western Conference's worst teams, the Denver Nuggets hope to bounce back against the club that's looking up at everyone. The Nuggets beat the woeful Sacramento Kings last week in Denver, but they'll be looking to avoid a fourth straight loss at Arco Arena when they wrap up a two-game road trip Thursday night. Denver (20-14) built half of its four-game winning streak without Carmelo Anthony, then got their star back Saturday against Sacramento (7-25). Anthony shot just 6 of 22 in his return from a five-game absence following the death of his sister, but the Nuggets cruised to a 104-86 victory behind 22 points from Chauncey Billups. Anthony was much better Monday against Houston, putting up 33 points and 11 boards in a 113-106 win. He had 31 Wednesday against the Los Angeles Clippers, but a poor shooting night - and an even worse rebounding effort - ensured Denver's streak would end. The Nuggets shots 37.5 percent and were outrebounded 57-43 in a 106-93 loss. "We weren't good at either end of the court," coach George Karl said. "Most nights this year we've had something going and tonight our defense wasn't good enough and our offense wasn't good enough." To make matters worse, backup point guard Ty Lawson left in the second quarter with a sprained left knee. He said he hopes to play Thursday. Despite Denver's easy win against the Kings on New Year's Day, it might have a more difficult time in Sacramento. The Nuggets have shot 42.7 percent from the field in losing three straight at Arco Arena. Anthony missed the most recent meeting in Sacramento - a 102-100 loss Jan. 9. Although he averaged 33.0 points in the other two losses, he needed 32.0 shots per game to get there. Though the NBA-worst Kings are 5-15 at home, Denver isn't much better on the road. The Nuggets have lost 10 of 13 away from home since early November, and the three wins are against teams that are a combined 35-71. Sacramento had won two straight at home - beating Memphis on Tyreke Evans' half-court buzzer-beater Dec. 29, then topping Phoenix 94-89 on Sunday - before hosting Atlanta on Tuesday. Evans had 29 points and five steals while DeMarcus Cousins added 24 points, but the Kings' defense cost them. The Hawks shot 51.3 percent in a 108-102 victory. "It's encouraging," Kings coach Paul Westphal said. "There's no doubt that we have things to work on, but I like the way that our players were relating to each other. ... There are signs that we're on the right path with these guys." Cousins has certainly been one of Sacramento's bright spots. The rookie center has averaged 22.3 points and 9.8 rebounds in his last four games after a three-game stretch in which he totaled just 13 points. "I think my focus is a lot better," said Cousins, who had 16 points while battling foul trouble Saturday in Denver. "I'm not letting the distractions like referees or bad plays on my part determine the rest of my game." Forcing bad shots could be Sacramento's key to extending its home streak in the series to four. Denver is 17-5 when its shoots 45 percent or better this season. The Kings, meanwhile, are 11-67 since 2009-10 when their opponents shoot 45 percent. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
