Heat-Grizzlies Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Nov 20 2010 2:36AM Chris Bosh hasn't quite lived up to expectations since coming over to Miami, but is doing his best to make up for lost time. After a six-game home stand, the Heat look to hand the struggling Memphis Grizzlies a sixth consecutive loss on Saturday night at FedExForum. Bosh averaged a career-high 24.0 points last season while with Toronto, but managed 14.5  per game in his first 10 games with the Heat (8-4). The five-time All Star broke out with a season-high 35 points on Wednesday, and followed with a 22-point, 14-rebound effort in Friday night's 95-87 win over Charlotte. The Heat blew a 21-point lead before regrouping over the final five minutes as LeBron James finished with 32 points and five assists, picking up the slack for Dwyane Wade, who was struggling with flu-like symptoms and had 11 points on 4-of-13 shooting. "We found a way to win a grind-out game," said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who saw his team blow a 22-point lead against Utah on Nov. 9. "It was ugly at times. It was not smooth ... but these games are good for us right now." Bosh, who is averaging 25.4 points in his last seven games against the Grizzlies, isn't concerned about aesthetics and simply wants to rack up as many victories as possible. "I just like to win," he told the team's official website. "You're going to have some games like that. Every game is going to give up a lead, if you point out one team in the league that hasn't done it or won't do it, then that will be spectacular. "Call me a glass half full kind of guy, but we won." Miami is scoring only 92.8 points per game on the road compared to 109.3 at home, and is hoping to have a full complement of players when it visits Memphis. James is averaging 8.6 assists, recording at least five in 11 consecutive games. While the two-time reigning MVP has gotten his teammates involved, look for him to get back to scoring in this game. He averaged 33.4 points on 55.6 percent shooting in seven games at Memphis while with Cleveland. The Grizzlies (4-9) meanwhile can't seem to get anything going as they continue to have issues on offense. They are scoring 91.6 points per game during their five-game losing streak, and struggled during their 89-86 loss in Washington on Friday night. O.J. Mayo, who is averaging 14.5 points, was held to career-low three on 1-of-11 shooting from the field. "We've got to do a better job mentally," said Mayo, who has scored 20.5 points per game lifetime versus the Heat. "What we're doing ain't working." Zach Randolph scored a team-high 19 points in Friday's loss and is averaging 18.3 points and 12.5 rebounds over his last eight games. Rudy Gay, who leads the team in scoring at 22.5 points per game, put up a career-high 41 against the Heat on Dec.13, 2009. Memphis has won four of six between the teams.
