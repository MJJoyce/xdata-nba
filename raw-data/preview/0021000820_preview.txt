76ers-Grizzlies Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Feb 14 2011 5:18PM Better results on the road have helped the Philadelphia 76ers remain in playoff contention. The Memphis Grizzlies are vying for a postseason berth in large part because of their strong play at home. While the Grizzlies won the previous matchup between the teams, the 76ers have shined in recent trips to Memphis and will search for a fourth straight win there Tuesday night. Philadelphia (26-28) has climbed into seventh in the Eastern Conference by winning nine of 12 and has prevailed in four of its last five road games after starting 5-18 there. After topping NBA leader San Antonio at home Friday night, the 76ers kicked off a three-game road trip by blowing out lowly Minnesota 107-87 the next evening. "When you have big wins like that, like we had last night, the next game against a supposedly lesser opponent is a tougher game," swingman Andre Iguodala said. "It's more important in a sense, I think. "It kind of shows where the team's at as far as not having too many ups and downs. Earlier in the year, we'd be way up here and we'd have a huge letdown the next night." After winning back-to-back games, Memphis seemed like it was experiencing its own letdown when it fell behind by 17 points with 3:56 left in the third quarter Sunday against visiting Denver. The Grizzlies, however, pulled away for a 116-108 victory by outscoring the Nuggets 20-8 over the final 7:10. "We feel like we have found our identity now. Now we know who we are and everyone knows their role," said swingman Sam Young, whose team shot a season-best 55.7 percent. "Everybody has a good understanding of what (coach Lionel Hollins) wants from us. We are applying everything that we are learning and everyone is starting to buy into it." The win was Memphis' 16th in 20 home games following a 2-4 start there. The Grizzlies, who haven't reached the postseason since 2006, have used those performances at home to remain in ninth in the West. They were 30-11 at home while earning their previous playoff berth but haven't won more than 18 games there in each of the past four seasons. Snapping a three-game home losing streak to the 76ers could help in the push to end that drought. After dropping five consecutive overall matchups, Memphis (30-26) has won two of three and earned a 99-94 victory at the Wells Fargo Center on Jan. 28 by outscoring the 76ers 42-21 in the final quarter. During that contest, Grizzlies guard O.J. Mayo began serving a 10-game suspension for violating the league's drug policy and could return Tuesday. Memphis also got Zach Randolph back Sunday after he missed one game with a sprained right ankle. Randolph recorded his 19th double-double in 21 games and has three straight against Philadelphia. He had 22 points and 12 rebounds in last month's win to lead five players in double figures. Iguodala has averaged 20.7 points on 51.0 percent shooting in his last three games in Memphis.
