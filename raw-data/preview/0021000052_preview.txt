A visit to Milwaukee could help make that happen. The Trail Blazers look to continue their recent success against the Bucks to conclude a four-game trip Tuesday night. Portland (3-1) outscored its opponents 85-49 in the fourth quarter to win its first three contests. Despite outscoring Chicago 25-22 in the final period Monday, the Trail Blazers never mounted a serious comeback in a 110-98 loss to the Bulls. "We just didn't have it," said Portland center Marcus Camby, who had nine points and 11 rebounds. "It would have been great to go undefeated." Despite the defeat, Portland is off to its best start since opening 4-1 in 1999-2000. With Milwaukee (1-2) up next, the Trail Blazers have a good chance to match that feat. Portland has averaged 105.4 points while winning six of seven over the Bucks. LaMarcus Aldridge, who had 33 points and pulled down nine rebounds Monday, has totaled 52 points and 18 boards in his last two games against the Bucks. He had 31 and 11, respectively, in a 108-101 double-overtime loss at Milwaukee on Dec. 12. Brandon Roy scored 23 points in that contest, and has averaged 24.3 on 46.6 percent shooting in three career games at the Bradley Center. Despite being held to 17 versus Chicago, Roy is averaging 23.0 points this season. Though Milwaukee is averaging 91.3 points and shooting 40.9 percent through three games, Portland must defend better after allowing the Bulls to shoot 60.6 percent. "We definitely need to play with more energy," Portland coach Nate McMillan said. "Defensively, I think we're playing soft." The Bucks look to build on their first win, 98-88 over Charlotte in Saturday's home opener. Brandon Jennings recorded his first career triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, and Carlos Delfino had 23 points as the Bucks finally displayed the unselfish, complete play coach Scott Skiles wanted to see. "We're getting there," Skiles told the Bucks' official website. "A win kind of stems the blows from the last two games." Jennings, who scored 55 points against Golden State as a rookie last November, believes his performance Saturday is the kind of effort he needs to put forth every game. "This is my best game since I've been in the NBA just the fact that I had a nose for the ball and I was being unselfish and I was everywhere," said Jennings, who averaged 15.0 points and 9.0 assists in two games versus Portland last season. Andrew Bogut, who scored 27 points in the December home win over Portland, had 14 points, eight rebounds and four blocks Saturday in his first regular-season game at the Bradley Center since dislocating his right elbow, spraining his wrist and breaking his hand in a severe fall in April. "I'm trying to get more confidence in my arm. I'm not entirely overly confident with where I think it needs to be, but it's going to take some time," said Bogut, who is averaging 12.3 points and 11.0 rebounds this season.
