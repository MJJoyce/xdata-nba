Raptors-Clippers Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Mar 26 2011 2:21AM Having recorded only one win away from home over nearly three months, the Toronto Raptors are threatening to match their worst single-season road record in franchise history. The Raptors, though, could have a chance to avoid that dubious feat in their next game. Following one of its most lopsided defeats this season, Toronto will try to bounce back with its sixth consecutive win over the Los Angeles Clippers and fifth in a row at Staples Center on Saturday night. The Raptors (20-52) suffered their 17th loss in 18 road games Friday with a 138-100 drubbing to Golden State. They allowed 84 points in the first half, 116 after three quarters, and trailed by as much as 47 in the final period. "It's probably one of the toughest games mentally I've had to go through in my career," rookie forward Ed Davis said. "You never want to go through that again." The blowout dropped Toronto to 6-30 away from home this season, and left it five losses shy of tying its 6-35 record from its inaugural 1995-96 campaign. Another win over the Clippers, however, would keep Toronto from that share of unwanted history. The Raptors have lost 28 of 35 overall, but one of those wins was a 98-93 home victory over the Clippers on Feb. 13. Toronto used Andrea Bargnani's 27 points, and a then-career high 14 rebounds from Davis to earn that win. The Raptors also entered that game excited to face Clippers rookie Blake Griffin, who still managed 21 points and 15 rebounds. "I think it gets our guys fired up to play him and try to stop him," coach Jay Triano said following the game. Toronto, though, didn't have to face Los Angeles' leading scorer, Eric Gordon, who was nursing a fractured right wrist. He has gotten off to an uneven start in four games since returning March 19. Gordon has scored 29 or more points in two of those games and 10 or fewer in the other two. He had seven points on 3-of-14 shooting in Friday's 112-104 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. Mo Williams tried to carry the club with a season-high 30 points, but the Clippers (28-45) trailed throughout. "I had an off night," Gordon said. "Things weren't going my way, and I just couldn't knock down a shot." The Clippers will try to rebound with their fifth win in seven March home games. However, they've lost by an average of 18.5 points in their last two matchups there against the Raptors. Toronto completed the biggest road comeback in team history in that building on Nov. 13, 2009, rallying from 22 down for a 104-89 victory. The Raptors might have to try to win this game without starting guard Jose Calderon, who left Friday with a strained left hamstring. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
