Knicks-Lakers Preview By BRETT HUSTON Posted Jan 08 2011 9:55PM The New York Knicks haven't beaten the Los Angeles Lakers since February 2007, but these are hardly the same Knicks of recent years. Amare Stoudemire and the Knicks look for a 10th straight win against a Western Conference foe as they continue their four-game trip Sunday night against the Lakers, winners of three straight after a rough stretch. The additions of Stoudemire and Raymond Felton have breathed new life into a team that's missed the playoffs in six straight seasons, with New York's latest win being its most lopsided yet. Stoudemire had 23 points in his return to Phoenix on Friday, but it was Felton who stole the show by posting his first career triple-double in a 121-96 rout that was the Knicks' first road win over the Suns in nearly seven years. "We had an all-around game tonight," said Felton, who had 23 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. "We had great defense and everybody was clicking on all cylinders offensively and defensively. I thought it was one of our best games this year." New York (21-14) arrives at Staples Center having lost six straight to the Lakers (26-11), but there's reason to believe it can snap that streak. The Knicks have averaged an astounding 119.2 points in winning nine straight versus Western opponents. That's the franchise's longest interconference winning streak since running off 13 straight from Dec. 7, 1993-Jan. 25, 1994. Stoudemire has averaged 29.3 points on 57.1 percent shooting during the nine wins, while Felton has averaged 20.9 points and 10.0 assists. Visiting Los Angeles has typically slowed Stoudemire down, however. He's averaged 15.1 points in 11 career regular-season road games against the Lakers, easily his lowest average away from home. Los Angeles has been playing impressive defense lately, holding 14 of its last 16 opponents under 100 points. An inconsistent and turnover-prone offense was evident during a 2-4 stretch from Dec. 21-Jan. 2, though, as Phil Jackson's team averaged just 88.5 points and 17.0 turnovers. Those problems seem to have disappeared. The Lakers have averaged 102.7 points and just 9.7 turnovers in three consecutive wins, the latest 101-97 against New Orleans on Friday. "Offensively, I think we're starting to work it out, starting to trust the offense, moving the ball," said center Andrew Bynum, who's averaged 14.7 points and shot 65.5 percent in the three victories. "If we continue to do both those things we'll be alright." While Bynum's increased production hasn't hurt, Los Angeles' biggest key to success seems to be getting Pau Gasol involved. The Lakers are 18-3 when Gasol scores at least 18 points. "We need him as a scorer," Jackson said. "It changes how the defense plays us. They can't focus on Kobe (Bryant) as much if they're worried about defending big guys back in the lane, and the big guys aren't so interested in coming to help out on Kobe or anybody else." Gasol and Bynum should be able to have success inside against a Knicks team that allows 47.7 points per game in the paint - second-worst in the league - but keeping Bryant in check should still be the first priority. He's averaged 35.5 points during the Lakers' six-game winning streak in the series, including a 61-point outburst on Feb. 2, 2009 at Madison Square Garden. There's reason for concern on the Los Angeles bench, however. Forward Matt Barnes tore the lateral meniscus in his right knee Friday and is out indefinitely.
