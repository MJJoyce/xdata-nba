Warriors-76ers Preview By JUSTIN EINHORN Posted Mar 01 2012 6:00PM On a night commemorating Wilt Chamberlain scoring 100 points, an entire team might not even reach that mark in his hometown of Philadelphia. The 76ers rarely give up 100 and haven't scored that many in nearly six weeks, and they'll face a struggling Golden State Warriors offense Friday night in a matchup of Chamberlain's former teams on the 50th anniversary of his historic performance. In nearby Hershey, Pa., Chamberlain scored 100 points to lead the Philadelphia Warriors to a win over the New York Knicks, setting a record that many believe will never be broken. The closest anyone has come was Kobe Bryant with 81 in a January 2006 game. Besides all fans in Philadelphia receiving a piece of the court from that 1962 game, the late Chamberlain's family will be honored in a halftime ceremony which will include many friends, former teammates and others connected to that memorable night. "It's going to be all Wilt, all night long," 76ers CEO Adam Aron said. The Warriors scored 169 points in the game, and it seems possible both teams won't even combine for that total Friday. The 76ers (21-15) haven't scored 100 in 19 consecutive games, their longest such stretch since the 2003-04 season. They've given up 100 twice in that span and lead the NBA in scoring defense, allowing 87.1 per game. Golden State has not scored 90 in either of its games since the All-Star break, failing to do so in back-to-back contests for the first time this season. Stephen Curry (foot) might be out again after missing most of those two games as the Warriors shot 4 of 34 from 3-point range and 37.5 percent overall. Philadelphia went 9 of 39 from beyond the arc in its final three games of February. The Sixers have failed to score 90 five times during their current 1-6 slump. They've been tied or led in the fourth quarter in three of those defeats, including a blown seven-point advantage in a 92-88 loss to Oklahoma City on Wednesday. "I think it's a trend late in games that we're struggling, we gotta get out of that," said Andre Iguodala, whose 3-pointer was Philadelphia's only scoring in the final four minutes. It was the 76ers' fourth straight home loss, though all of those defeats came to top-tier Western Conference foes - San Antonio, the Clippers, Dallas and Oklahoma City. They were 13-3 at home before this skid. "When you look at the teams here we've played at home, it's just been one after the other of cream of the crop teams," coach Doug Collins said. "We're growing, we're learning. It's frustrating, but we're gonna keep fighting and hopefully we're gonna find a way to start winning some of these games." Golden State (14-18) is far from being elite but has won three of four, including an 85-82 victory at Atlanta on Wednesday. Curry missed all but the final 3 seconds due to a strained tendon in his right foot. Dominic McGuire took his place in the starting lineup and went scoreless, but grabbed 15 rebounds while helping hold Hawks leading scorer Joe Johnson to 6 of 17 from the field. "He embodies everything we've preached about since Day 1, and I thought the important thing is to make a statement and to start the guy that has done everything we've asked him to do," coach Mark Jackson said. McGuire's job Friday will likely involve trying to extend Lou Williams' struggles. The 76ers' top scorer has averaged 12.3 points and 31.6 percent shooting in the past six games, including 4 of 16 from 3-point range. Williams scored 23 points in a 107-79 road victory over Golden State on New Year's Eve, the Sixers' fourth win in five meetings. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
