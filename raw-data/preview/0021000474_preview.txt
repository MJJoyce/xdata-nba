Spurs-Mavericks Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Dec 30 2010 10:21AM Statistically, Tim Duncan is having one of the worst seasons of his career. That hasn't stopped the San Antonio Spurs from getting off to their best start in franchise history. The Dallas Mavericks are struggling to adapt without injured superstar Dirk Nowitzki. The top two teams in the Western Conference meet Monday night when San Antonio travels to Dallas in search of its 13th win in 14 games. Duncan is averaging 13.2 points and 9.4 rebounds, far below his career norms of 20.9 and 11.5. His two points on 1-for-7 shooting in Tuesday's 97-82 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers matched a career low set two other times, most recently Dec. 2, 2007. The other two times Duncan finished with two points, though, were games which he left early due to injury - playing less than 11 minutes in each case. The two-time NBA MVP played nearly 30 minutes against the Lakers. Duncan has scored in single digits in three of the last four games after recording four straight double-doubles Dec. 15-20. DeJuan Blair had 17 points and 15 rebounds to help make up for Duncan's lack of presence in the paint. With Manu Ginobili also struggling Tuesday, Tony Parker picked up the slack. Parker scored 23 points for the Spurs (27-4), who are off to the NBA's best 31-game start since the 2007-08 Boston Celtics opened 28-3. Duncan and Ginobili sat most of the fourth quarter against the Lakers. "It means Tony Parker was amazing tonight," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. In-state rival Dallas didn't fare nearly as well in its first game without Nowitzki. The Mavericks (24-6) lost for only the second time in 19 games, falling 84-76 at home Tuesday against Toronto. Dallas shot 41.3 percent as Nowitzki nursed a sprained knee suffered in the second quarter of Monday's win against Oklahoma City. He's listed as day to day, but the Mavericks may lose his 24.1 points for multiple games. Shawn Marion started in place of Nowitzki and scored 12 points, and Jason Terry scored a game-high 18 as the Mavericks set a season low for points. The last time Dallas produced such a low total was Dec. 5, 2009, in an 80-75 loss to Atlanta. "We've got to get used to playing without the big fella for a while," center Tyson Chandler said. "We had a tough time adjusting. Our defense held them to 84, but offensively we had nothing." Dallas is one of the few teams to have beaten San Antonio, winning 103-94 on the road Nov. 26. The Mavericks outscored the Spurs 32-21 in the fourth quarter to pull away, snapping San Antonio's 12-game winning streak and extending their own streak to 12. Nowitzki, who scored 26 points in the victory, is likely to miss his second straight game. Dallas has defeated San Antonio four straight times in the regular season but lost to the Spurs in six games in the first round of last season's playoffs.
