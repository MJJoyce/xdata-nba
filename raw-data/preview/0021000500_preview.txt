Warriors-Magic Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Jan 02 2011 8:02PM Two weeks after revamping their roster, the new-look Orlando Magic appear to have hit their stride once again. The Magic look to match a season high with their sixth straight victory when they host the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. Orlando (21-12) lost its first two games as part of a 1-8 stretch after acquiring veterans Gilbert Arenas, Hedo Turkoglu and Jason Richardson in a pair of trades Dec. 18. The retooled roster now appears to be getting comfortable, as the Magic have won five in a row and regained some confidence. The Magic, who extended their current streak Friday with a 112-103 home victory over New York, won six straight Nov. 24-Dec. 3. "I think that we're becoming a very unselfish team," forward Ryan Anderson told the Magic's official website. "We're learning what each other can do. We're definitely just looking for each other's shots and creating openings." Orlando averaged 96.6 points before the new acquisitions joined the lineup, and 107.0 on 49.5-percent shooting during the five-game winning streak. "I think we're playing at a faster pace," backup guard J.J. Redick said. "It's more energy and I think that was the thinking behind the trade was to give us new life." Turkoglu had 17 points against the Knicks, and is averaging 15.5 over the last four games. After averaging 12.3 points in his previous three games, Dwight Howard broke out with 24 and 18 rebounds versus New York. Howard also collected his NBA-high 12th technical foul, leading coach Stan Van Gundy to believe his star is being singled out by the officials. "I don't think he's any harder on officials than anybody else in the league," said Van Gundy, who was later fined $35,000 for his comments. "There are a lot of guys around the league who are a lot harder on officials, yell at them, swear and everything else and get away with it." Howard had 28 points with 12 boards in the Magic's 117-90 victory over Golden State on March 3. Orlando is averaging 116.3 points and shooting 50.1 percent during a four-game winning streak in this series. Richardson has averaged 11.7 points in seven games since joining Orlando, but 23.1 in 10 career contests against the Warriors. Golden State (13-20) fell to 1-2 on a five-game trip after blowing a 20-point lead in a 114-107 loss at Miami on New Year's Day. The largest lead the Warriors had previously blown in an eventual loss this season was nine, at Detroit on Nov. 7. Dorell Wright scored 30 points and Monta Ellis added 25 but the Warriors were outscored 56-35 in the second half to fall to 5-14 on the road. Wright is averaging 26.8 points on 59.1 percent shooting over the last four games. "I'm just getting an opportunity," said Wright, scoring a career-high 16.2 points per game in his first season with the Warriors. "I don't have to worry about anything. Just go out there and play my game. There is no better feeling than that." Ellis ranks among the league leaders averaging 25.4 points, but has averaged just 12.0 in three career games at Orlando.
