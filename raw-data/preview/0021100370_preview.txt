Suns-Bucks Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Feb 07 2012 12:25AM Michael Redd broke the 40-point barrier 11 times during his time with the Milwaukee Bucks, but a 17-point performance for the Phoenix Suns on Saturday could have been one of the best moments of his career. Redd is likely in for another memorable game Tuesday, regardless of how many points he scores. Returning to Milwaukee for the first time since spending his first 11 seasons there, Redd will try to help the Phoenix Suns win three straight for the first time in nearly a year. Signed by Phoenix as a free agent two games into this season, Redd replaced the injured Jared Dudley (bruised thigh) on Saturday, earning his first start since Jan. 10, 2010, while with the Bucks. Redd took advantage of the chance, hitting four 3-pointers and scoring a season-high 17 points in a 95-89 victory over league-worst Charlotte. Left knee injuries limited Redd to 61 total games from 2008-11. "To come back, through the (ACL and MCL) tears, through the hurt, through the hours of rehab, training to come back and accomplish this is may be the most proud moment of my career," he said. That's saying a lot coming from a player who is ranked second in Bucks history with 1,003 3-pointers and fourth with 11,554 points. While the 32-year-old Redd, who scored 10 points off the bench in Monday's 99-90 victory at Atlanta, is trying to revive his career, Steve Nash continues to play at a high level in his 16th season. The two-time league MVP, who turns 38 on Tuesday, is averaging 15.0 points and 10.0 assists for Phoenix. "I feel good and I enjoy playing," Nash said after scoring 24 points with 11 assists Monday. Nash said the discomfort in his bothersome right shoulder "wasn't bad," so there's a good chance he'll be in the lineup again Tuesday when the Suns (10-14) go for their first three-game winning streak since a four-game run last Feb. 23-28. The Bucks (10-13) probably wish Nash would take the night off. Nash had 10 points and a season-best 17 assists Jan. 8 as the Suns won their 24th in a row at home in this series, 109-93. Phoenix has also been dominant in the overall series, winning 36 of its last 41 meetings with Milwaukee. That doesn't bode well for a Bucks team coming off two rough losses following a three-game winning streak. A night after falling 88-80 at lowly Detroit, Milwaukee was routed 113-90 at home Saturday by Eastern Conference-leading Chicago. "We've got eight straight quarters of pretty poor defense," said coach Scott Skiles, who started his NBA coaching career in Phoenix from 1999-2002. Milwaukee point guard Brandon Jennings, the team leader with 19.9 points and 5.4 assists per game, should be well-rested after scoring eight points in 22 foul-plagued minutes Saturday. Jennings, though, finished with a season-low five points and four assists last month in Phoenix. The Bucks are 7-3 at home, compared with a 3-10 mark on the road. Phoenix won its last visit to Milwaukee 102-88 on March 4, when it went 11 for 24 from 3-point range. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
