76ers-Nuggets Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Dec 26 2010 1:27AM The Denver Nuggets are expected to be without Carmelo Anthony again. Returning home could soften the blow of at least one more game without their top scorer. The Nuggets attempt to continue their success at the Pepsi Center and avoid a season-high three-game losing streak when they face the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday night. Denver (16-12) has dropped six of nine, but that stretch includes a 1-5 road record after it fell 114-106 at Oklahoma City on Saturday. That defeat came three nights after a 109-103 loss at San Antonio, and the Nuggets haven't dropped three in a row in the regular season since March 20-24. Not having Anthony could make avoiding that fate much more challenging. The All-Star forward is expected to miss at least one more game while being with his family following the death of his sister on Tuesday. He leads the Nuggets with averages of 24.0 points and 8.3 rebounds, and they're 1-3 without him this season. Anthony's absence was also felt in the most recent meeting with the 76ers (11-18) on Jan. 3, as he sat out with a fractured hand as the Nuggets lost 108-105 at home. It's unclear if he'll be back against Portland on Tuesday. Coach George Karl is more concerned with his team's defensive play. Denver is among the worst in the league allowing an average of 105.5 points - 112.3 over the last four games. "We're just giving up too many points on the road," Karl said Saturday. "We're just trying to outscore people. We never really got a rhythm to how we were going to win the game." The Nuggets have found a consistent rhythm at the Pepsi Center, ranking among the best home teams in the NBA with a 12-2 record and league-leading 111.6 points per game. Another strong effort from Chauncey Billups could help. The guard has totaled 50 points over the last two games after sitting out the previous three - all at home - with a wrist injury. He's averaging 15.3 points and a team-high 5.3 assists. Nene is also coming off a solid performance, scoring 21 points while grabbing 12 rebounds against the Thunder. The center is averaging 17.3 points and 7.4 boards over the last seven games. He had 24 points and 15 rebounds against the 76ers in January. The Nuggets and Sixers split two meetings last season with the visitors winning each time. Philadelphia, though, is among the worst road teams in the league at 3-12. The team is 1-2 during this season-high eight-game road trip, but appeared to score a moral victory with Wednesday's 84-80 loss at Eastern Conference-leading Boston, a night after being routed 121-76 at Chicago. "I couldn't be more proud of them," coach Doug Collins said. "(Tuesday) was such an aberration. Our guys compete every night, and for them to come out and play the Celtics like they did, they showed who they are. That's who I know they are." Elton Brand had 16 points and 12 rebounds against the Celtics after making 2 of 9 shots and scoring six points Tuesday. The forward leads the team with averages of 15.0 points and 8.4 boards, and scored 16 points with seven rebounds and three blocks at Denver in January.
