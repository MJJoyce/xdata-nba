The Jazz will look for their 15th consecutive home victory against the Clippers on Saturday night. Utah has gone 40-1 at home against the Clippers since the start of the 1989-90 season, outscoring them by an average of nearly 14 points per game. Deron Williams was efficient from the floor, but struggled to take care of the ball in Friday night's 85-78 loss to Golden State. Williams scored a season-high 23 points on 9-of-18 from the field. He also had just his fifth career game with at least eight turnovers. Utah coach Jerry Sloan said turnovers were an issue the entire game. "We just didn't seem to have the energy to compete with them," he said. "When you give up 21 turnovers for 27 points, that's almost a goodbye kiss." Williams should bounce back against the Clippers. He has put up double digits in assists in three straight contests, and is averaging 10.6 over his last eight games against them. Al Jefferson had 16 points and a season-high 15 rebounds Friday for his second double-double this season. While with Boston and Minnesota, Jefferson recorded eight double-doubles in 13 career-starts versus Los Angeles. The Jazz (2-3) averaged 104.2 points in 2009-10 - fourth-best in the league - but have struggled to score consistently so far, averaging 86.7 points in their losses compared to 122.5 in the wins. However, they shouldn't have to worry about offense against the Clippers. Utah has scored more than 100 points in 14 of its previous 17 games against Los Angeles, taking 13 of them. The Clippers are hoping to avoid starting 0-3 on the road for the first time since 2006-07 after falling to Denver 111-104 on Friday night. Los Angeles (1-5) led by one at halftime but was outscored 29-17 in the third quarter and trailed for the remainder of the game. Blake Griffin scored a career-high 26 points on 11-of-18 from the floor and grabbed 10 rebounds. Coach Vinny Del Negro knows his team needs to come out with a better effort on defense to be competitive. "We can't give up 111 points and think we are going to beat a lot of teams," he said. "We have to do a better job defending and controlling the tempo a little better." Eric Gordon finished with 21 points - the third straight game in which he's topped 20. A 37.1-percent shooter from 3-point range, Gordon is 10 of 21 from beyond the arc in his career, and averaging 19.5 points in four career starts against the Jazz. Two-time All Star Baron Davis, who was third on Clippers last season with 15.3 points per game, missed his third straight contest with a sore left knee and his status for Saturday remains unknown. The Clippers last defeated the Jazz in Utah 96-89 on Jan. 22, 2003. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
