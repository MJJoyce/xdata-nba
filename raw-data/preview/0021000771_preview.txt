Grizzlies-Thunder Preview By MATT BECKER Posted Feb 08 2011 12:36AM Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant has finished well below his league-leading scoring average in his last two games. The two-time All-Star has had no such trouble piling up points against the Memphis Grizzlies lately. Durant looks to lead the Northwest Division-leading Thunder to a sixth victory in seven games Tuesday night when they host the Grizzlies. Averaging 29.0 points per game, Durant is in good position to win a second straight NBA scoring title. However, he's coming off a pair of relatively pedestrian performances. After finishing with 24 points in Friday's 111-107 win at Phoenix, Durant scored 21 in Saturday's 121-105 victory in Utah. The 22-year-old forward had averaged 40.8 points in his previous four games. Saturday's point total was Durant's fourth-lowest of the season, and his fewest since scoring 16 in a loss at San Antonio on New Year's Day. His teammates had no trouble picking up the slack. Russell Westbrook led the way, finishing with 33 points and 10 assists for the Thunder (33-17), winners of five of six. Westbrook made all four of his 3-point attempts as Oklahoma City shot a season-best 61.9 percent (13 of 21) from beyond the arc. "Whatever my team needs me to do, I am ready," said Westbrook, who was 10 of 15 from the field overall. "If that's scoring, that's what I'll do, and (Saturday) I was firing away." Durant generally does plenty of scoring when Oklahoma City plays Memphis (27-26). Durant had 40 points in a 109-100 home victory over the Grizzlies on Jan. 8, and has averaged 35.3 on 60.0-percent shooting while helping the Thunder win the last three meetings in Oklahoma City. He has topped the 30-point mark in five of the last six overall games versus the Grizzlies, with the lone exception a 28-point effort Jan. 4 in a 110-105 loss in Memphis. Westbrook also had 28 points in that game, and finished with 22 points and 11 assists in the meeting four days later. The Grizzlies arrive in Oklahoma City hoping to avoid losing three straight games for the first time since Dec. 17-21. Two nights after falling 95-93 in overtime at Houston, Memphis lost 93-84 at home to the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday. The Grizzlies had won a season-best five straight and eight of nine immediately before dropping their last two games. The Grizzlies have shot 40.4 percent in their last two losses after averaging 105.3 points on 50.8-percent shooting in their previous four games. "We didn't play as desperately as they did," Rudy Gay said after the loss to the Lakers. Zac Randolph missed 12 of 14 shots against Los Angeles and finished with eight points, his fewest since scoring four in the season opener. Randolph, who had averaged 24.7 points while shooting 58.5 percent in his first three games this month, has totaled 58 points in this season's previous two meetings with the Thunder.
