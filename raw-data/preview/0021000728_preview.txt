Rockets-Jazz Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 02 2011 3:03PM The Utah Jazz were close to full strength when they barely overcame the Houston Rockets earlier this season. They won't have two of their best players this time around, however. With Deron Williams and Andrei Kirilenko out, the injury-plagued Jazz will try for a third consecutive home victory when they host the Rockets on Wednesday night. Utah's 83-78 win over Charlotte on Monday night came at a price, as Millsap - already dealing with a bruised right thumb - dislocated his left pinky finger. Kirilenko suffered a badly sprained left ankle. Williams, leading the team with 21.9 points and 9.4 assists per contest, missed his third consecutive game due to a wrist injury, and he'll sit out again Wednesday along with Kirilenko. Millsap, averaging 16.8 points and 7.8 rebounds, is probable. The Jazz (29-20), who had lost seven of eight prior to Monday, came out with an impressive defensive effort against the Bobcats, allowing their lowest point total of the season. "We got some key stops at the end," said forward Al Jefferson, who had 21 points and 11 rebounds. "... That's the way we got to play. We got to have the energy on defense. We got to help each other." Coach Jerry Sloan was pleased with his team's all-around effort Monday after a disappointing 96-81 loss at Golden State the night before. "After the game we had (Sunday), it felt good to watch them play a little harder," Sloan said. "And when you play hard, you always have a chance to win." The ailing Jazz might look for Jefferson to lead the way offensively again Wednesday. He has recorded seven consecutive double-doubles against the Rockets - averaging 27.7 points and 15.7 rebounds over that span - including a 24-point, 13-rebound effort Jan. 8 to help Utah erase a 14-point halftime deficit en route to a 103-99 overtime win. Jazz reserve C.J. Miles, who had 16 points in that win, scored 20 versus the Bobcats as the Jazz improved to 15-1 when he scores at least 15 points. The Rockets (22-28), meanwhile, are hoping to avoid a season-worst-tying four-game road losing streak after falling to the Los Angeles Lakers 114-106 in overtime Tuesday night. Houston, which ranks 27th in the NBA with 108.4 points per game allowed on the road, has surrendered at least 100 in all 10 games as the visiting team in 2011 - going 3-7 over that span. "Our margin of error is so small because we're a small team," forward Shane Battier said after the Rockets were outrebounded 54-44 on Tuesday. "... We were right there, played good defense and forced tough shots, but we have to maintain concentration and discipline and really get five guys rebounding for the entire game." Kevin Martin, averaging a team-best 23.1 points, scored 30 after recording 10 points on 4-of-13 shooting in a 108-95 loss at San Antonio on Saturday. Martin could be in line for another big game Wednesday, as he has averaged 27.5 points in his last 10 games versus the Jazz. Luis Scola continued his strong play of late Tuesday, recording 24 points and 15 rebounds. He is averaging 25.7 points - 6.3 more than his season mark - and 11.0 rebounds over his last three games. Houston had lost six of seven visits to Utah before splitting two last season. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
