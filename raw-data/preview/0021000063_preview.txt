Coming off their first loss, the Warriors try for a third straight home victory Wednesday night against the Memphis Grizzlies. After falling 107-83 to the defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, the Warriors should be looking forward to returning home. Golden State shot 54.3 percent and averaged 120.5 points in home victories over Houston and the Los Angeles Clippers to open the season. Golden State, which has not started 3-1 since 2005-06, has won two straight and six of eight over Memphis (2-2) at Oracle Arena. However, if the Warriors are to continue their success at home they must improve on Sunday's effort when they shot 40.9 percent and committed 18 turnovers. "We need to bounce back and play well on Wednesday," forward David Lee told the Warriors' official website. "There's something to be learned from every game." Lee, who totaled 32 points and 27 boards in the first two home games, needs to bounce back after recording three rebounds and no points in 19 minutes against the Lakers. He's averaged 19.0 points and 11.7 rebounds in his last three contests versus Memphis. Golden State will likely be without guard Stephen Curry (20.5 points per game) for a second straight game due to an ankle injury. "I've got to make a smart decision," Curry told the Warriors' official website. "It's Game 4. Even if I could play, I don't want to risk playing on a 75-percent ankle the rest of the season." Guard Monta Ellis is averaging 27.0 points on the season, and 25.0 on 48.0 percent shooting in his last five games against the Grizzlies. The Grizzlies, who have given up an average of 115.0 points in their last eight trips to Oracle Arena, lost 124-105 to the Lakers in the opener of a four-game trip Tuesday. Rudy Gay scored 30 points and point guard Mike Conley added 16 with eight assists as the Grizzlies fell to 1-1 on the road. While Gay averages a team-leading 24.3 points, Conley's play is a big reason for Memphis' solid start and earned him a five-year contract extension worth $40 million. Averaging career highs with 15.3 points, 8.3 assists and 5.5 rebounds through four games, Conley joins Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant, Atlanta's Al Horford and Chicago's Joakim Noah as the only players from the 2007 draft class to receive such an extension. "I think it's a testament to what I've done," Conley said. "I've made a lot of strides so far this season and I just want to keep on improving." Conley had 21 points and nine assists during a 128-110 loss at Golden State in the teams' last meeting March 24. Gay has averaged 20.0 points in eight career games at Golden State. A bruised tailbone could force Memphis forward Zach Randolph to miss a fourth straight game Wednesday. "That's a bad place to have an injury," coach Lionel Hollins said. "You don't realize how much you move that tailbone when you're playing and doing things." Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
