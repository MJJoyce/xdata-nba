Two weeks into the season, Wade feels the chemistry is getting closer to where it needs to be. The Heat look to build on the Big Three's most balanced performance and beat the Utah Jazz for an eighth straight time at home on Tuesday night. Wade, James and Bosh were the go-to scorers on their respective teams last season, and all finished in the top nine in the league in scoring. With the three signing with Miami (5-2) over the summer, it was obvious they wouldn't be able to produce at their normal clips and the team admitted it was going to be a process to get the offense in sync. The Heat's offense took a big step forward in Saturday's 101-89 win over New Jersey, as Wade had 29 points, James scored 23 and Bosh added 21. It was first game where the superstar trio all topped the 20-point plateau. "We're starting to get more of a comfort zone," said Wade, who has led the Heat in scoring all three games this month. "It's only been seven games," he added. "We can look at the next seven as hopefully being better than we were in the first seven." The Heat opened a six-game homestand against the Nets, and have now outscored their opponents by an average of 23.4 points in winning their three games at AmericanAirlines Arena. They've enjoyed similar success against the Jazz, winning seven straight over Utah in Miami since an 83-73 loss on March 10, 2003. The Heat have also won 11 of the last 13 meetings overall. Wade has been instrumental to the winning streak, averaging 32.3 points in six career home games against Utah. James has also had little trouble scoring against the Jazz, averaging 33.3 points for Cleveland in six contests against them since 2007-08, his second-best scoring average against any opponent. While Wade, James and Bosh continue to work on the offense, Miami's defense is already looking sound. The Heat are limiting teams to 40.4 percent shooting while holding all seven opponents to fewer than 100 points. They'll now try to shut down one of the league's most inconsistent offenses. Utah (3-3) has averaged 118.0 points while shooting 44.4 percent from 3-point range in its victories, but just 86.7 points on 22.5 percent from beyond the arc in its losses. The Jazz open a four-game road trip following Saturday's 109-107 double-overtime victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Utah battled back from 18 points down in the first half and Deron Williams sent the team to its third win in four games with a tiebreaking layup with 6.8 seconds remaining in the second overtime. "Great players make great plays," said Jazz guard C.J. Miles, who was held to two points on 1-of-13 shooting. Williams scored 22 of his 30 points after halftime and seems to be finding his shooting touch. The All-Star point guard is averaging 22.8 points on 48.6 percent shooting in the last four games after averaging 15.0 points on 27.3 percent shooting in the first two. Williams averaged 20.5 points while shooting 68.2 percent in two games against the Heat last season. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
