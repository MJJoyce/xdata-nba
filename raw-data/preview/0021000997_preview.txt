76ers-Jazz Preview By MATT BECKER Posted Mar 13 2011 4:26PM The Philadelphia 76ers had been rolling along offensively until their last two games. They should have better luck against a Utah Jazz team that has been getting run over lately. The 76ers look to get their offense back on track and sweep the season series from the Jazz for the first time in 23 years when they meet Monday night in Salt Lake City. After averaging 108.9 points over a nine-game stretch, Philadelphia (34-32) understandably had some trouble offensively against Boston's stingy defense on Friday. Nobody scored more than 14 points for the 76ers, but they still beat the Atlantic Division-leading Celtics 89-86 for their eighth win in 10 games. A night later in Milwaukee, Philadelphia's offense looked even worse, shooting 39.7 percent in a 102-74 loss. Louis Williams had 16 points off the bench, but the Sixers committed 21 turnovers and finished with their fewest points of the season. "We came out flat in the beginning. Tried to make a run in the third quarter but it just didn't work for us," said Jodie Meeks, who had 13 points. "We just have to forget about it." A game against Utah (34-33) should help. The Jazz, 3-10 since Jerry Sloan stepped down as coach, have been extremely vulnerable on the defensive end lately, surrendering an average of 112.3 points on 50.9 percent shooting in their last 10 defeats. In Saturday's 118-100 loss to Chicago, the defense was nonexistent early, allowing the Bulls to set season highs for points in the first quarter (37) and in the first half (68). Utah trailed 75-44 less than two minutes into the third quarter, the third time in four games it fell behind by 31 points. "I don't know what it is," said Al Jefferson, who had 33 points and 18 rebounds. "We let teams come out and do what they want to do on the offensive end." Despite suffering another embarrassing defeat, the Jazz are still just two games back of eighth-place Memphis in the Western Conference. "That window of opportunity is getting smaller and smaller," Jefferson said of Utah's playoff chances. "Two weeks from now we can't say, 'We got to turn it on.' We've got to have it turned on by then." The Jazz were a season-best 14 games over .500 at 27-13 on Jan. 14, but are now in danger of dropping to the break-even mark for the first time since they were 3-3 on Nov. 6. They haven't been at .500 this late in the season since finishing 41-41 in 2005-06, the last time they missed the playoffs. It has been considerably longer since Utah was swept in a season series by Philadelphia. The 76ers beat the Jazz 96-85 on Jan. 22, as Andre Iguodala finished with 22 points, Williams added 20 and Elton Brand scored 19. That snapped Philadelphia's six-game losing streak in the series and marked just its eighth win in 40 meetings. The Sixers, who have lost 19 of their last 21 games in Salt Lake City, haven't swept the season series since 1987-88. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
