Bobcats-76ers Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Mar 30 2013 1:05AM Time has all but run out on the Philadelphia 76ers' playoff hopes. Failure to take advantage of back-to-back games against the lowly Charlotte Bobcats would likely hasten their official elimination. The 76ers will try to continue their dominance over the Bobcats on Saturday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Philadelphia (29-43) has only 10 contests remaining as it tries to make up a 6 1/2-game deficit to Milwaukee for eighth place in the Eastern Conference. The 76ers have kept their faint hopes alive by winning three of four, including a 100-92 victory over the Bucks on Wednesday. Philadelphia followed with a 97-87 win in Cleveland on Friday as Evan Turner had 23 points and a season high-tying 13 rebounds. "Any type of win is a great win," Turner said. "I got in a good rhythm coming right out of halftime. Any time when I'm attacking, I feel like I can be successful. The shots started falling, which was definitely cool." Jrue Holiday contributed 20 points and Spencer Hawes registered his sixth double-double in eight games with 16 points and 11 rebounds. "Our guys are playing to win, which is great," Doug Collins said. "The spirit of the team is good, which I really like. This was a good win, and I'm very proud of our guys." The 76ers will next try to record their first three-game win streak in nearly two months and earn a season-high fourth straight victory at home. A visit from the Bobcats would appear to help Collins' team in pulling off both feats as Philadelphia has won five straight in the series and four in a row at home. The 76ers prevailed 87-76 in the most recent meeting Feb. 9 in Philadelphia as Lavoy Allen had a career-high 22 rebounds and 14 points. Holiday scored 20 and Jeremy Pargo added 12 off the bench in his debut with the team. Turner had 25 points and four other Sixers scored in double figures in a 104-98 win in Charlotte on Nov. 30. The Bobcats (17-55) head into this game with three wins in their last six contests but lost 111-102 at New York on Friday after falling behind by 30 in the first half. Gerald Henderson tied a career high with 35 points in the team's season high-tying ninth straight road defeat. "We've got a lot of fight," Henderson said. "It's just tough when you see you're down 30. It's hard to see the light. We got a lot of guys with pride and a lot heart. We just couldn't come up with it at the end of the game." The 76ers and Bobcats will close the season series Wednesday in Charlotte, the start of a four-game road trip for Philadelphia. The Bobcats wrap up a three-game trek Monday in Milwaukee before returning home. Philadelphia hasn't won three straight since Jan. 30-Feb. 4, and its last four-game home win streak was Jan. 27-Feb. 1, 2012, which started with an 89-72 win over Charlotte.
