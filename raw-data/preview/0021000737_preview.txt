Magic-Wizards Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Feb 04 2011 1:28AM Gilbert Arenas is no longer a star in Orlando like he once was in Washington. That might not be a problem for the veteran guard. Arenas and the visiting Magic try to hand the Wizards their seventh straight loss Friday night when the teams meet for the first time since the December trade that sent Arenas to Orlando. The three-time All-Star was the subject of trade rumors most of the first month of the season. He seemed destined to leave Washington with knee and ankle injuries slowing him down and overall No. 1 pick John Wall the focal point of the team's rebuilding process. The controversial Arenas likely wore out his welcome even before the regular season after he was suspended 50 games in 2009-10 for bringing a gun into Washington's locker room, then faked an injury to sit out a preseason game in October. "I sensed something when I was coming off the bench," Arenas said. "The excuse was that they needed scoring off the bench." Arenas, who averaged 25.0 points and 5.7 assists in just over seven injury-plagued seasons in Washington, is averaging 8.7 and 3.9 assists in 23 games off the bench for the Magic (31-19). The 29-year-old looked at the move as an opportunity for a second chance and is only being asked to help solidify Orlando as an NBA title contender. "This is a true new beginning," Arenas said when he was traded Dec. 18. Arenas was not much of a factor with 10 points and four assists in 27 minutes of Orlando's 104-100 loss to Miami on Thursday. The Magic have lost two in a row and four of six. "We need to do the things we need to do to get ourselves ready, individually and collectively," said Magic guard Jameer Nelson, who scored 22 points. "We shouldn't have to come out and talk about energy or intensity every night." Despite their recent rough stretch, the Magic will try for a fifth consecutive victory over Washington (13-35). Orlando has averaged 110.5 points and shot 52.9 percent its last four games against the Wizards, but needed a Dwight Howard putback with 4.3 seconds left to leave Washington with a 100-99 win Nov. 27. Howard, who had 17 with 16 rebounds versus Miami, scored 32 in that contest and finished with 23 in a season-opening 112-83 victory over the Wizards on Oct. 28. That defeat began Washington's road struggles. Washington dropped to 0-25 away from home this season after it concluded a four-game trip with Tuesday's 97-89 loss at New Orleans. The Wizards already lost seven straight overall Dec. 5-18. "We're not giving in and we're not giving up," said Washington forward Andray Blatche, who scored 21 points Tuesday. "It's tough when you fight the whole game and you come up short." Wall (14.7 ppg) was held to four points on 2-of-10 shooting Tuesday. He had 14 with nine assists in his NBA debut against the Magic, but missed the teams' November meeting because of a bruised right knee. Washington swingman Nick Young, who scored 30 against New Orleans, has averaged 23.1 points the last 13 games. The Wizards are 13-10 at home, but have dropped two of three there.
