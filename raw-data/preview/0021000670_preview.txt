They might have a better chance to accomplish that feat and snap a five-game road skid when they face the struggling Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night. Philadelphia won a season-best three in a row Dec. 12-15 and nearly matched that streak before falling 112-109 in overtime at Detroit on Jan. 8. The 76ers (19-25) won the final two of a subsequent three-game homestand but fell 99-98 in overtime at Orlando last Wednesday. In its return home, Philadelphia posted back-to-back victories - each by double digits. Thaddeus Young had 24 points off the bench and Elton Brand scored 22 to help the Sixers top the century mark for the first time in nearly two weeks with Monday night's 105-95 win over Phoenix. "With (Young) in there, we have terrific speed, so we were able to push the ball," coach Doug Collins said. "We had some beautiful fast breaks tonight." Collins' team has posted a 39-20 advantage in fast-break points during its two meetings with the Raptors this season but has lost both, falling 106-90 in Toronto on Nov. 24. The 76ers have shot 39.9 percent in those games and allowed the Raptors (13-32) to connect at a 47.4 percent clip. Toronto, though, enters this matchup having dropped eight straight, its longest losing streak since a 10-game slide March 26-April 12, 2006. The Raptors suffered their latest defeat in heartbreaking fashion as Memphis' Rudy Gay hit a go-ahead shot in the final second Monday night. Toronto had eight players see action for the second straight time during that 100-98 defeat, its season high-tying third in a row at home and ninth in 11 contests there. The Raptors haven't dropped four straight at home since Dec. 14-31, 2008. Linas Kleiza and Joey Dorsey are dealing with sore right knees, and Jose Calderon is trying to overcome an illness. Leandro Barbosa (right hamstring) and Reggie Evans (broken right foot) are also out. Evans had a career-high 22 rebounds and 12 points Nov. 24 against Philadelphia. In his first start back from a sore left ankle Monday, Jerryd Bayless set career highs with 11 assists and eight rebounds while scoring 15 points. "I feel better," Bayless said. "I kind of tweaked a little bit (in the loss) but I'll be fine. I just have to continue getting better. We all have to dig deep because we're losing right now. We have to find a way to win." Andrea Bargnani, who has scored at least 28 points in the past two games, has averaged 27.0 in the two meetings this season against the 76ers. DeMar DeRozan has a combined nine points in those matchups but is averaging 24.4 over the past five games. Brand had a season-high 27 points in a 94-86 home loss to the Raptors on Nov. 17 but missed the road game while serving a suspension for a flagrant foul. The 76ers have one win in their last seven meetings with Toronto, 114-101 at the Air Canada Centre on March 7. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
