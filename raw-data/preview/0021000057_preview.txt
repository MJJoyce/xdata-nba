The visiting Pacers try for a third consecutive victory by beating the winless 76ers for the second time in five days Wednesday night. After a season-opening 122-109 loss at San Antonio last Wednesday, Indiana has won two straight games for its best start since going 3-0 in 2007-08. "I think this is good for a team this young to be sitting 2-1 after the first week," said Pacers point guard Darren Collison, who had 15 points and four steals in a 99-86 win over Philadelphia on Saturday. "We just need to continue to work." Danny Granger scored 22 points, Mike Dunleavy added 16 with nine rebounds and Roy Hibbert had 14 and 13 rebounds as the Pacers beat the 76ers (0-4) for a third straight time. Indiana has averaged 105.0 points while holding Philadelphia to 93.3 per contest during that three-game winning streak. The acquisition of Collison (13.7 points per game, 5.7 assists per game) from New Orleans and the emergence of the 7-foot-2 Hibbert (18.3 ppg, 10.0 rebounds per game) have helped the Pacers get off to a positive start. Being able to beat winless clubs Charlotte and Philadelphia also has factored into the team's early success. "Our chemistry on this team appears to be very good," Collison told the Pacers' official website. "Everyone seems to get along with each other. There is no animosity." Indiana hopes that remains the case as they try for its fifth win in six trips to Philadelphia. Granger is averaging 27.0 points this season and 23.0 in his last four road games against the 76ers. Collison has totaled 32 points in two career games versus Philadelphia. The 76ers again fell short in earning their first victory, losing 116-115 in overtime at Washington on Tuesday. Philadelphia has not lost five straight to open a season since 2001-02. "We have to break a lot of losing habits," first-year 76ers coach Doug Collins said. "You don't know how heartbreaking it is for me to walk into that locker room and tell these guys, 'You're playing hard, you're playing hard,' but you have to break bad habits. Losing teams have bad habits. They're not broken overnight." Louis Williams scored 20 of his game-high 30 points in the fourth quarter for Philadelphia, which shot a season-high 55.0 percent. However, the 76ers could not prevent Washington's Cartier Martin from hitting a 3-pointer with 0.3 seconds left to force overtime. Elton Brand added 21 points, but No. 2 overall pick Evan Turner was held to nine in 27 minutes while No. 1 selection John Wall finished with 29 points, 13 assists and nine steals. Despite the 76ers' early struggle, Williams is averaging a team-leading and career-high 19.8 points off the bench. He had 18 against the Pacers on Saturday.
