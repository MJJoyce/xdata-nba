Hoping to avoid a 13th loss in 14 games overall, the Wizards will try to get their second road win and take the season series from the Raptors on Friday night. The Wizards opened the season 0-25 as the visiting team, breaking the previous franchise record of 15 straight defeats from Dec. 23, 1999-Feb. 20, 2000. After recording its only road victory of the season, 115-100 over NBA-worst Cleveland on Feb. 13, Washington (16-50) has gone on to lose five more away from the Verizon Center. The Wizards play 10 of their last 16 games on the road, where they have been outscored by an average of 14.0 points in 30 losses. Toronto (18-49), meanwhile, will be happy to return home after its longest road losing streak in franchise history stretched to 14 games with a 107-93 loss to Detroit on Wednesday night. The Raptors were outscored by 14 in the opening quarter. Despite cutting the deficit to five in the fourth, Toronto suffered its fifth loss in six games overall. "We fought hard to get back into it, and then they pulled away," said forward Ed Davis. "We had a lack of focus and a lack of energy, and it showed up in the first quarter. We have to come ready to play." Andrea Bargnani, first on the team with 21.7 points, had averaged just 12.5 on 28.0 percent shooting in his previous two games prior to scoring 20 against the Pistons. Bargnani was held to an average of 15.0 points as the Raptors and Wizards split their first two matchups of 2010-11 before scoring 25 in Toronto's 98-95 road loss Jan. 15. The Raptors haven't lost the season series since going 1-3 in 2007-08. Washington is shooting 49.2 percent against Toronto this season but struggled again offensively in its 98-79 loss at Chicago on Tuesday night. The Wizards, shooting 41.0 percent and 19.7 percent from 3-point range during their current five-game overall skid, trailed by 12 after the first quarter. Despite the team's woes, center JaVale McGee recorded the first triple-double of his career with 11 points, 12 rebounds and 12 blocks while rookie Jordan Crawford scored a season-high 27 points. "In the NBA it can be a 360, and the next day you never know what can happen," said Crawford, acquired by Washington prior to the trade deadline. "Luckily I was ready. I want to feed off this game and keep going." Crawford is averaging 19.3 points over his last four games. McGee's block total was the NBA's highest since Toronto's Keon Clark had 12 on March 23, 2001. "We'd like to see (McGee) do that more," said coach Flip Saunders. "Concentrate more defensively and protect the rim." Andray Blatche (sprained right shoulder) missed his third straight game Tuesday. Josh Howard (left knee tendinitis) and Nick Young (bruised left knee) were also held out. All three players remain uncertain for Friday, which could leave three rookies in the Wizards' starting lineup. Young, averaging a team-best 17.7 points, scored 29 in the last meeting with Toronto while Blatche had 17 points and 13 rebounds. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
