Wizards-Grizzlies Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Mar 17 2012 1:34PM The Memphis Grizzlies were unable to pull out a victory in their latest game even with their lineup finally intact. Perhaps a visit by the lowly Washington Wizards can help Memphis produce a better result. The Grizzlies are trying to avoid their first three-game losing streak at FedExForum since the beginning of last season Sunday night, facing a Wizards team which hasn't won there in more than seven years. Zach Randolph had 25 points and nine rebounds Friday in his first game after missing 37 with a torn MCL, and Rudy Gay added 26 points and 11 boards after missing one with concussion symptoms. Memphis (24-18), though, fell to 0-2 on its three-game homestand with a 114-110 overtime loss to Toronto. "I felt pretty good once I got into the groove," said Randolph, who hadn't played since Jan. 1. "My timing is a little off. I felt rusty on both ends. I just have to get getter and keep improving." The Grizzlies, who shot a season-low five free throws in Tuesday's 116-111 double-overtime loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, missed 20 of their franchise record-tying 51 free-throw attempts against the Raptors. "They gave us opportunities to win the game. We kept shooting ourselves in the foot," said coach Lionel Hollins, whose team committed 18 turnovers. Memphis, three games ahead of the ninth spot in the Western Conference standings, will try to limit those mistakes and build momentum for a stretch of nine of 11 on the road beginning Tuesday. First, the Grizzlies try to avoid dropping three in a row at home for the first time since Nov. 10-16, 2010. They won for the ninth time in 12 games against Washington with a 107-93 victory Jan. 29, 2011, in the teams' last meeting. Randolph scored 24 points with 20 rebounds as Memphis ran its home winning streak in the series to six, dating to Nov. 3, 2004. Washington (10-33) arrives in Memphis after falling to 1-3 on a season-high six-game trip with Friday's 102-88 loss to Atlanta. Playing their fourth game in five nights, and second since JaVale McGee, Nick Young and Ronny Turiaf were traded in a three-team swap that brought Nene and Brian Cook on board, the Wizards were held to 34 second-half points. "We threw the ball all over the place," coach Randy Wittman said after his club committed 20 turnovers. "Dribble, dribble, dribble. We all took turns just dribbling the ball." With Grizzlies guards Mike Conley and Tony Allen ranking among the league's best in steals with 2.6 and 1.7 per game, respectively, John Wall will have to take better care of the ball after matching a career high with nine turnovers Friday. Wall, averaging 19.3 points and 10.3 assists over the last three games, had 14 points with eight assists and five turnovers in last season's loss at Memphis. While Cook might be available, Nene's Wizards debut likely won't happen until at least Wednesday. "We've got guys in there that are NBA players," Wittman said. "We don't need to wait on anybody." Memphis is 12-3 against sub-.500 teams. Washington is 0-12 on the road against teams which currently have winning records. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
