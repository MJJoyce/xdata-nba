Nuggets-Kings Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Dec 16 2012 1:33AM After beating one of the top teams in the Western Conference, the Denver Nuggets hope to take their home-court success on the road. They might have that opportunity against the struggling Sacramento Kings. The Nuggets will try to win their sixth straight in this series and send the Kings to a fourth consecutive loss on Sunday night. After winning twice on a five-game trip, Denver (12-12) heads back on the road following a 99-94 victory over Memphis on Friday. Andre Miller scored 18 points, including four free-throws in the final 10 seconds to key a statement-making victory over the Grizzlies. "Against a really good team, that was a really good win for us," said Danilo Gallinari, who had 14 points. "We were able to do the right things at the right time at the end of the game." The Nuggets have been able to do all the right things at home, winning six of seven there while averaging 103.1 points. However, they've had trouble continuing that success on the road, where they are 6-11. Defense has been the team's biggest problem away from Denver, allowing 103.5 points in road games compared to 94.0 at home. Andre Iguodala has been one of the biggest culprits. The first-year Nugget has averaged 16.9 points and 9.3 rebounds with a 52.9 field-goal percentage at home, but has been limited to 12.6 points and 5.3 boards while shooting 39.2 percent in road games. Denver is one of the league's best offensive teams and that could continue against a Sacramento squad that has allowed 110.0 points during its three-game losing streak. That skid followed a season-high three-game win streak for the Kings (7-15), who capped a four-game trip with a 113-103 loss at Oklahoma City on Friday. Sacramento did rally back from a 24-point deficit to cut the Thunder's lead to 103-98 in the fourth quarter. "I thought our guys played and competed," coach Keith Smart said. Isaiah Thomas sparked the comeback, scoring a season-high 26 points on 10-of-13 shooting off the bench. He scored 23 in the fourth quarter – two shy of Mitch Richmond's Sacramento-era record for points in a period. The guard had totaled 15 points in his previous three games. "The big thing with me, I score in bunches, so if I make a couple, I feel like I can keep it going," Thomas told the team's official website. Tyreke Evans finished with 21 points, giving him 38 in two games since returning from missing five of six contests because of a knee injury. Evans has averaged 18.5 points in eight career games against the Nuggets, including a 27-point performance in 119-116 overtime loss in the teams' last meeting March 5. While DeMarcus Cousins finished with 10 points in his return from a one-game suspension Friday, the Kings are expected to be without reserve guard Marcus Thornton (personal) for a third straight game. Cousins had 17 points and 15 rebounds in the Kings' 122-93 loss to Denver in the only meeting in Sacramento last season. The Nuggets have scored at least 100 points in 18 of their last 19 meetings with the Kings and had 99 in the lone exception. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
