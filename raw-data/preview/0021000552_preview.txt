Rockets-Celtics Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Jan 10 2011 12:47AM The Boston Celtics are trying to rebound from one of their worst performances of the season. Kevin Garnett might be back to help them do just that. The Celtics could be in for a major lift if Garnett is able to return to the court as they open a six-game homestand against the sputtering Houston Rockets on Monday night. Boston (28-8) saw its four-game losing streak end with a 37.8-percent shooting performance in Saturday's 90-79 loss at Chicago. "We had a lot of one-pass shooting," said Paul Pierce, who had 21 points and three of Boston's season-low 12 assists against the Bulls. "There's really no explanation. That's really not the way we play." The Celtics may feel much more comfortable at TD Garden, where they're an Eastern Conference-best 16-2 and have won three in a row. They may also find comfort in Garnett's impending return as they begin a stretch of seven games in 13 days. Garnett is due back this week after missing six games with a right leg injury - suffered on a dunk late in the first quarter of a 104-92 loss at Detroit on Dec. 29. Garnett is averaging 15.0 points and a team-leading 9.5 rebounds on the season. He's averaging 22.1 points and 11.8 boards in his last 18 games against Houston (16-21). Boston has dropped seven of its last nine home meetings with the Rockets, including a 119-114 overtime defeat April 2 as the teams split last season's two-game series. Paul Pierce, the Celtics' leader with 19.1 points per game, is averaging 26.3 on 59.5-percent shooting over the last three matchups against Houston. The Rockets, 6-14 on the road, are trying to avoid their first six-game overall losing streak since Nov. 13-23, 2007. They appeared ready to end their current slide Saturday, but wasted a 14-point halftime lead and lost 103-99 in overtime to Utah. "Same problems we were having early in the season, we have now," said Luis Scola, who had 24 points and 10 rebounds against the Jazz. "It's frustrating. We deserved to win this game, but we didn't know how to close it out." Houston shot a season-low 37.8 percent from the field, including a 3-for-25 effort from 3-point range. The Rockets are giving up an average of 108.4 points over their last seven games. "We've got to play through it, fight through it," forward Shane Battier told the team's official website. "Winston Churchill said when you're going through hell, keep going. Hopefully we can turn it around, win a few games and get the confidence back." Kevin Martin has been a bright spot over the last three games, averaging 30.7 points on 56.3-percent shooting after scoring 20 on Saturday. Martin missed the Rockets' April victory at TD Garden due to a left shoulder sprain. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
