Knicks-Warriors Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Nov 18 2010 4:53PM Fans of the Golden State Warriors haven't always had a lot to cheer about, but the team's surprising undefeated start at home has provided some excitement. The Warriors look to improve to 6-0 on their own court for the first time in 20 years Friday night when they meet the New York Knicks, who haven't won in Oakland since 2001. Golden State (7-4) has made the playoffs once in the last 16 years and had the third-worst home record in the NBA with a .478 win percentage over that stretch. However, a young roster has given the Warriors a boost. They are off to their best start in four years and looking to open 6-0 at home for the first time since 1990-91. On Monday, the team's new ownership group took in a 101-97 win over Detroit. After losing its previous two, Golden State nearly blew all of a 32-point, first-half lead before holding on. Monta Ellis finished with 27 points and Stephen Curry added 21. "New ownership, new coach just the whole philosophy here is clearly different," said Joe Lacob, who is part of the new group. "Something very special happened here already. I'm looking forward to the rest of the year here to see how good we can be." David Lee missed a third straight game after undergoing surgery Friday to eliminate an infection in a cut in his elbow suffered after colliding with Wilson Chandler in a 122-117 win at New York last Wednesday. He was expected to miss at least a week and has been ruled out for Friday. The Knicks (4-8) won't be too upset about not facing their former teammate again after he scored 28 points and added 10 rebounds in last week's meeting. He isn't the only one that was able to score with ease in that game. Curry had 25 points on 11-of-20 shooting while Ellis added 22. The Knicks haven't been able to stop anyone recently, giving up an average of 112.8 points over their last five games. After a 120-118 loss to Denver in the opener of a four-game trip Tuesday, they outlasted Sacramento 113-106 on Wednesday to snap a six-game losing streak. Danilo Gallinari and Amare Stoudemire each scored 27 points and Stoudemire also had 10 rebounds. Six players reached double figures as New York shot 52.1 percent and scored 40 points in the second quarter after a 14-point first quarter. Stoudemire was 11 of 19 from the field and is shooting 53.0 percent over the last six games after he shot 42.0 percent in the first six. "We have to get used to this feeling," Stoudemire said. "Tonight was a night where we showed progress from the Denver game. We played well in that game. Tonight we carried it over. We have to keep this swagger and this mentality and go on to the next one." Stoudemire, averaging 21.6 points and 8.1 rebounds, had 33 points and 10 boards last week against the Warriors. Golden State has won eight in a row at home against New York and is 15-4 overall in the series - winning four straight - since the 2001-02 season. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
