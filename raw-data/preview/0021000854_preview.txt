Keeping the young superstar fresh and on the court could help end another extensive slide. Griffin looks to lead the Clippers to their first road win over the Hornets in more than four years Wednesday night. Griffin leads all rookies with an average of 22.9 points and his 12.5 rebounds per game rank fourth among all players. He had 24 points and 13 boards in a 99-95 home win over New Orleans (33-25) on Nov. 22, ending a 14-game skid in the series for the Clippers (21-36). Now, Griffin will try to end Los Angeles' seven-game road losing streak to the Hornets, dating back to a 100-90 win on Jan. 8, 2007 in Oklahoma City. He was held to 10 points and six rebounds in a 101-82 loss at New Orleans on Nov. 9, and avenging that defeat may be a tall task. The Clippers are 5-22 on the road this season and 2-7 during an 11-game swing that concludes Friday against the Lakers at Staples Center. Griffin ended up on the bench after committing four fouls midway through the first quarter of Tuesday's 111-88 loss to Oklahoma City during his first visit to his hometown as a pro. He overcame the foul trouble to finish with 28 points, 11 rebounds and a season high-tying eight assists, but later admitted feeling fatigued. "Definitely tired from the All-Star weekend. However, every team has to play on the road and we just need to do a better job of keeping our stamina up," said Griffin, who won Saturday's slam-dunk contest after leaping over the hood of a car. While Griffin may be feeling tired, the Hornets are well-rested as they look to end a slump. Having lost nine of 11 going into the break, New Orleans hopes Emeka Okafor has recovered from a strained left hip that's sidelined him for nine straight games. The center averages 11.1 points and a team-leading 10.1 rebounds, and the club has gone 2-7 since his last action on Jan. 30. The Hornets fell again without Okafor, 103-96 at Portland last Wednesday as their slide reached three. "It's really tough," said guard Chris Paul. "The only good thing is we've got a lot of basketball left to play." Paul also may be looking to improve after averaging 11.6 points and 7.8 assists over the last four games. He scored 10 points with seven assists and five steals during Sunday's All-Star game in Los Angeles. Paul is second on the team with 16.2 points per game while leading with 9.6 assists. In the most recent meeting with the Clippers, Paul was limited to 14 points and six assists while the Hornets got 30 points and 10 boards from David West West leads New Orleans with an average of 19.0 points and is second on the club with 7.6 rebounds. Jarret Jack, averaging 11.6 points over the last five games, was arrested and charged with drunken driving in an Atlanta suburb Sunday. It's unclear if the guard will face disciplinary measures. The Hornets agreed Wednesday to acquire forward Carl Landry from Sacramento in exchange for guard Marcus Thornton, but Landry is unlikely to be active for this game.
