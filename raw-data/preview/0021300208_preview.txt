Pelicans-Spurs Preview By ELI KABERON Posted Nov 24 2013 6:53PM The San Antonio Spurs have won 10 straight games, and it hasn't only been due to their trademark tough defense. Coming off their highest-scoring game of the season, the Spurs look to keep rolling when they host the New Orleans Pelicans, who are on a winning streak of their own. San Antonio (12-1) went a stunning 16 of 24 from 3-point range and routed Cleveland 126-96 on Saturday. Seven players made at least one 3, and the Spurs shot 57.5 percent overall. "We did a great job moving the ball," reserve center Matt Bonner said. "We shot the 3 great tonight. We don't really play any individual basketball. We don't care who scores; no one's trying to get their stats. "It's about getting the best shot we can." The Spurs allowed their highest point total of the win streak, but they've given up fewer than 90 six times during the stretch. San Antonio has also been outstanding offensively, scoring 102 or more points six times in the past 10 contests. San Antonio led the Cavaliers by 43 at one point. "Starting off the game, they got into a good comfortable rhythm and we just couldn't stop them," Cleveland's Kyrie Irving said. The Pelicans (6-6) have won three in a row and are also coming off a victory over the Cavaliers, 104-100 on Friday. New Orleans rallied from 12 down in the final 4:44, closing the game on a 23-7 run. "All our guys, instead of separating, came together," coach Monty Williams said. "We know we can come back. We know we can play in close games. ... It was emotional." Six players scored in double figures for New Orleans, which has recorded at least 104 points in four straight contests. The Pelicans outrebounded the Cavaliers 54-47 and scored 50 points in the paint, though they allowed 48. Power forward Anthony Davis went 5 of 13 from the field, although he grabbed 13 rebounds and scored 17 points. "As long as we get the win (I'm OK)," Davis said. "I love winning. As long as we get the win, I'm fine. If I have zero points and zero rebounds (I'm ok), as long as we get the win." San Antonio won the 2012-13 season series 3-1 and has taken 14 of the past 17 meetings with the New Orleans franchise. The Spurs' Tony Parker scored 23 or more points in three matchups with New Orleans last season. He is shooting 54.2 percent from the field this season, second highest among guards who have more than 100 attempts. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
