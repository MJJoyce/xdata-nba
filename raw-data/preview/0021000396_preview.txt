Jazz-Bucks Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Dec 18 2010 1:44AM It's unlikely the Utah Jazz could have played much worse than they did in their last contest. They haven't looked all that good during their recent trips to Milwaukee. The Jazz look to bounce from their worst offensive effort of the season and avoid a third straight road loss to the Bucks on Saturday night. Utah (18-9) averaged 101.3 points per game before shooting 35.8 percent while scoring its fewest points this season with Friday's 100-71 loss to New Orleans in the opener of a four-game road trip. "We just didn't have any answers," coach Jerry Sloan told the Jazz's official website. The Jazz went 3 for 19 from 3-point range, 10 of 20 from the free-throw line and got few second chances while being outrebounded 53-24. Paul Millsap had 14 points and was one of just three Jazz players to score in double figures. Utah did have center Mehmet Okur on the floor for the first time since rupturing his left Achilles' tendon in last season's playoffs, but he managed only two points and one rebound in 10 minutes. "It could have been better, but I'll take it because it's the first game," said Okur, who averaged 13.5 points and 7.1 rebounds in 73 games last season. "We just have to work harder and move on." Deron Williams averaged 32.0 points on 29-of-55 shooting in his previous three games, but made 4 of 12 shots and finished with a season-low 10 Friday. "This is one of those games that nothing went right for us from the start," he said. Williams had 22 points with 10 assists in Utah's 109-88 home win over the Bucks on Nov. 29, but totaled 28 points on 8-of-28 shooting in his team's last two visits to Milwaukee. The Jazz averaged 86.5 points, shot 39.9 percent and committed 40 turnovers while dropping both of those games at the Bradley Center. The Bucks (10-14), meanwhile, have won two in a row and four of five at home. "(Milwaukee is) a great team," said Utah's Al Jefferson, who had 22 points and 11 rebounds against the Bucks last month. "When they're healthy, they'll be really good. "That coach (Scott Skiles) makes every team he ever coached play hard." Milwaukee point guard Brandon Jennings has fared well against Williams and the Jazz in the teams' last two meetings. He had 27 points at Utah last month and 23 with six assists in a 95-87 home win March 12. Jennings, however, was held to 12 points on 4-of-18 shooting as Milwaukee had its three-game winning streak snapped in a 92-90 loss at league-leading San Antonio on Wednesday. Though Andrew Bogut recorded seven rebounds against the Spurs, Milwaukee's center has averaged 19.8 points and 14.2 boards in his last six games since missing five with back spasms. Bogut sat out last month's loss at Utah, but had 16 points with 12 rebounds in the home victory over the Jazz in March. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
