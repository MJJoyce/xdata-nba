Grizzlies-Kings Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Dec 28 2010 6:36PM After dropping 25 of their first 26 games in Sacramento, the Memphis Grizzlies have been far more successful in recent road matchups with the Kings. Given how each team has fared lately, the Grizzlies would seem to have a good chance to continue that success Wednesday night. Memphis will try for a third straight win while sending the NBA's worst club to a season-high ninth consecutive loss and sixth in a row at Arco Arena. The Grizzlies' 100-91 victory over the Kings on Nov. 6 was their third in the last four road games against Sacramento. Rudy Gay led the way for Memphis with 32 points, and the forward has also been boosting his team with defense lately. Gay had five steals for the second straight game in a 96-85 victory over Toronto on Monday, while Tony Allen recorded a season-high six off the bench. The two players were also among five Grizzlies to score in double figures, led by Zach Randolph with 21 points. "I thought our effort was tremendous," coach Lionel Hollins said. "Our defense was just superb. ... Everybody was just playing their role and doing what they need to do." Gay has 18 steals in his past four games for the Grizzlies (14-17), who have given up 90 points or fewer in their back-to-back victories after allowing three straight opponents to top 100. Memphis hasn't allowed Sacramento (5-23) to score more than 95 points in its last three road victories in the series. The Grizzlies have also scored at least 100 in seven of their last eight at Arco and in 14 of 15 overall matchups. Memphis has won the past three of those behind Gay, who averaged a team-best 24.3 points on 55.1 percent shooting. Since joining the Grizzlies at the beginning of last season, Randolph has averaged a team-leading 25.0 points and 13.0 rebounds during his three trips to Sacramento. He had 20 points and 11 boards Nov. 6 for his fifth straight double-double at Arco. Kings guard Tyreke Evans scored 30 points in that game but is shooting 38.0 percent on the season and averaging 16.8 points - 3.3 fewer than what he averaged while winning rookie of the year honors in 2009-10. "I'm just trying to put (the struggles) in the past and trying to not think about anything," Evans said. "I've been playing terrible this year." After scoring a season-low four points Thursday, Evans bounced back with a season-high 32 against the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday but missed an 9-foot shot in the final seconds of a 100-99 loss. The Kings' two defeats in the past three games have come by a combined six points, with one of the losses going to overtime. "Whether people noticed it or not, we've been playing hard and competitive basketball for a long time now," said coach Paul Westphal, whose team has dropped 22 of 24. "We're trying to do everything we can to take that one extra little step and cash these games into wins." A similar effort might help Westphal's club avoid its first nine-game skid since March 31-April 13, 2009. Sacramento hasn't dropped six in a row at home since an eight-game slide Nov. 11-Dec. 6, 2008. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
