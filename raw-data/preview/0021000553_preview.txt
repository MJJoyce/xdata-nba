Pistons-Bulls Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Jan 09 2011 3:18PM Derrick Rose helped the Chicago Bulls keep their losing streak brief with another outstanding performance from the free-throw line. He's hurt the Detroit Pistons from other spots on the United Center floor throughout his short career. The Bulls guard will try to help his team extend its season-high six-game home win streak with a 10th straight victory over the Pistons on Monday night. Rose made 15 of 19 free throws - both career highs - in a 90-79 victory over Atlantic Division-leading Boston on Saturday. His 36 points helped the Bulls (24-12) bounce back from consecutive road defeats to a pair of sub-.500 teams, New Jersey and Philadelphia. While studying film recently, Rose noticed that he needed to get deeper in the lane on his drives to draw more fouls. He went a career best 10 for 10 from the line against the 76ers on Friday. "Usually I just try to take off and avoid the contact or take off, and they block my shot or something," he said. "(I'm) just making sure I take my time in the hole and go up to their body first." Any improvements for Rose could spell trouble for the Pistons, who have had plenty of problems defending him at the United Center. Rose scored a career high-tying 39 points in a 101-91 home win over Detroit on Oct. 30, going 13 of 27 from the floor and 10 of 13 on foul shots. Rose has averaged 25.8 points in four career home games versus the Pistons, shooting 62.5 percent from the field. That's helped the Bulls fashion nine-game win streaks against the Pistons both overall and at home. The third-year guard and his team could be in for another big performance, as Detroit (12-24) has allowed 106.3 points over its last three games. The Pistons have dropped four straight on the road and have one win in their last 13 away games. They managed to avoid a fourth consecutive loss with a 112-109 overtime victory over Philadelphia on Saturday. Austin Daye hit a tying 3-pointer with 3.5 seconds left in regulation and scored the first five points in the extra period. Daye finished with 15 points, while fellow reserve Greg Monroe scored a career-high 16 and posted his second straight double-double. "(The future) really looks good to me, but hopefully it looks good to (team president Joe Dumars)," Daye told the team's official website. "Joe's the one who drafted us ... and I bet he's pleased seeing us out there on the floor at the end of games, making plays." Tayshaun Prince led Detroit with 23 points in another strong shooting performance, and Rodney Stuckey had 20 after scoring a combined three points in his first two games back from illness. Prince has shot 56.5 percent over the past four games, although an 8-of-15 effort was not enough to help the Pistons end their skid against Chicago on Dec. 26. Prince had 17 points to lead five Pistons in double figures, but Carlos Boozer scored 31 in a 95-92 overtime victory at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Rose finished with 23 points despite missing 14 of 23 shots. He matched a career high with 12 rebounds and added eight assists. The Bulls last won seven in a row at home March 24-April 11, 2009.
