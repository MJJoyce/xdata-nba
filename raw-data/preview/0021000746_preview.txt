Hawks-Wizards Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 05 2011 1:42AM The Washington Wizards are on the verge of their longest losing streak of the season. Snapping their skid against the Atlanta Hawks seems very unlikely. While hoping to end its seven-game losing streak, Washington will look to avoid a 12th consecutive loss to the visiting Hawks on Saturday night. The Wizards (13-36), still the only winless road team in the NBA after going 0-4 on their recent trip, lost 110-92 to Orlando on Friday and find themselves mired in their worst stretch since losing seven straight Dec. 5-18. "Its very disappointing, we always play well at home, we always take care of home," said forward Andray Blatche. "Not to get a win coming off a long road trip and losing, it puts a little more pain on to it. "On the bright side, we have a game (Saturday) and we're going to come out and be aggressive." Nick Young, scoring a team-best 17.3 points per game, had averaged 24.3 in his previous 12 home contests before scoring 17 Friday. He recorded 20 points in a 116-96 loss at Atlanta on Nov. 25. Washington has lost 11 straight in this series by an average of 10.0 points since a 102-98 overtime win in Atlanta on Jan. 11, 2008. The Hawks (32-18), meanwhile, are coming off a last-second 101-100 overtime victory Friday against the Los Angeles Clippers. Al Horford made two clutch free throws after the Clippers' Blake Griffin was called for a flagrant foul with 0.6 seconds remaining. Horford, named to the Eastern Conference All-Star team along with teammate Joe Johnson, was in obvious pain after the foul and earned high praise from coach Larry Drew for his courageous effort. "It was a nasty spill by him," Drew said. "He wasn't going to signal to come out in that situation. ... You're practically going to have to wheel him off the floor for him not to shoot the free throws, and he stepped up and nailed them both." Horford finished with 23 points and 12 rebounds for his fourth double-double in five games. Atlanta was up 12 heading into the fourth quarter after outscoring the Clippers 32-17 in the third, but shot 7 of 24 (29.2 percent) - 2 of 11 from 3-point range - over the final 12 minutes and nearly squandered the lead. After averaging 9.7 points in his previous three games, Jamal Crawford scored 34 while Johnson fell just shy of a triple-double with 17 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists. "Joe has been playing a very well rounded game lately, he hasn't been just out there looking to score," Drew said of Johnson. "He doesn't get the credit I think he deserves for that, but his game is really starting to become well rounded, and when it does, it just makes us that much more effective." Marvin Williams had nine points and six boards in his return from a two-game suspension for throwing punches in a 111-102 win over New York on Jan. 28. He is averaging 5.5 points in his last four meetings with the Wizards. The Hawks have been one of the league's best defensive teams on the road, allowing 94.7 points per game. The Wizards are 3-21 when scoring less than 95 points. Washington last lost eight straight during a 16-game skid March 3-30. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
