Rockets-Thunder Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Nov 17 2010 12:57AM A spirited effort in their last contest has the Oklahoma City Thunder primed to continue their recent run of success. The Thunder look to maintain that momentum when they host the banged-up Houston Rockets on Wednesday night. One night after losing by 13 at home to San Antonio, Oklahoma City (6-4) bounced back with a 115-108 win at Utah on Monday. The Thunder have won three of their last four contests after losing three of four. "It shows a lot about our team," reserve forward D.J. White told the Thunder's official website. "It shows a lot about our character and our will to win." Kevin Durant had 30 points while Serge Ibaka added 22 with 11 rebounds and Russell Westbrook also scored 22 as Oklahoma City continued its offensive surge. The Thunder have averaged 109.5 points and shot 49.8 percent in its last four games. "We left it on the floor, and we can go home and tell ourselves we improved," Thunder coach and former Rockets guard Scott Brooks said. Durant has averaged 30.4 points in his last five contests. Oklahoma City is 48-33 all-time when Durant scores 30 or more. He had 25 when the Thunder snapped a 13-game losing streak to Houston with a 122-104 home win on March 24. Durant has averaged 26.5 points in his last four home games against the Rockets. Though Oklahoma City seems to have found its offensive touch of late, and Houston has averaged 109.3 points while going 2-3 on the road, both are among the worst defensive teams in the NBA. The Rockets have allowed 110.2 points per game on the road while the Thunder's opponents are putting in 106.0 per contest overall. After winning its previous two games on the road without injured starters Yao Ming (leg) and Aaron Brooks (ankle), Houston (3-7) fell 95-92 at home to Chicago on Tuesday. Yao, averaging 10.2 points and 5.4 rebounds after missing all of last season due to foot surgery, may be out for another extended period. The team initially thought he would miss a week, but coach Rick Adelman said he didn't know when the seven-time All-Star center would return. Aaron Brooks (16.4 ppg) is likely to miss his sixth in a row Wednesday. "We're going to have to rely on whoever we have at the moment," guard Kevin Martin told the Rockets' official web site. "We just have to keep on building chemistry and just go from there." Luis Scola continues to do his best to step up in the absence of the 7-foot-6 Yao, averaging 22.6 points and 10.2 boards this season. The 6-foot-9 Scola had 27 points against Chicago while 7-footer Brad Miller added 21, but Houston's two big men could not prevent the Rockets from being outrebounded 40-32. Scola had 25 points in the Rockets' loss at Oklahoma City in March. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
