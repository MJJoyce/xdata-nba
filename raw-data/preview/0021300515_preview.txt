Warriors-Bucks Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 06 2014 4:17PM The surging Golden State Warriors are enjoying their longest single-season winning streak in nearly 40 years. They would appear to have a good chance to keep rolling against the NBA's worst team. The visiting Warriors try to make it 10 in a row and end their recent woes against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night. Golden State (23-13) has proved unbeatable over the last two weeks, outscoring opponents by an average of 11.2 points during its run - the team's longest since winning 10 straight Dec. 6-23, 1975. The Warriors also put together a nine-game winning streak spanning the 1990-91 and 1991-92 seasons. "It puts into perspective the history of this franchise and how far in a short period we've been able to turn it around with great moves by ownership, by management, spectacular players that have bought in," coach Mark Jackson said. "The other thing is sustaining. It's a heck of an accomplishment, but like I said there is still a lot of work to be done." Golden State improved to 5-0 on its season-high seven-game road trip with Sunday's 112-96 win over Washington. Klay Thompson went 6 of 9 from 3-point range and finished with 26 points while David Lee scored 21 to go along with 11 rebounds. Former Bucks center Andrew Bogut also came up big with 15 points, 11 boards and a season high-tying four blocks for the Warriors, who are neck-and-neck with the Los Angeles Clippers for first place in the Pacific Division. "To be honest, at this point in the season we are not too concerned about that," said Lee, averaging 24.5 points while shooting 67.2 percent over the last four games. "We're concerned if we are playing the right kind of ball right now. We're finding ways to get wins. And we've been looking for that consistency now since the start of the season. It seems like we've found it now and we've got to keep it going." The Warriors have to be feeling good about doing just that against Milwaukee (7-26), which has yet to beat a team with a winning record. However, the Bucks have had Golden State's number of late, taking three straight and seven of eight in the series. Stephen Curry, leading the Warriors with 23.0 points per game, has been limited to 16.2 in six matchups with the Bucks, his third-lowest mark against any club. Milwaukee returns home after concluding a 1-2 trip with Saturday's 116-100 loss to Phoenix. Brandon Knight had 25 points and O.J. Mayo added 20 off the bench, but the Suns scored 38 points off the Bucks' season-worst 26 turnovers. "It was the turnovers that really hurt us, and turnovers that you can't even recover from," said coach Larry Drew, whose team has dropped 10 of 12 while allowing 104.7 points per contest. "That's the disheartening part about a game like this." Frustrations appear to be taking a toll on Milwaukee, which saw teammates Larry Sanders and Gary Neal get into a heated argument in the locker room afterward. Mayo described the run-in as "a little Kumbaya moment." "There are different ways you go about it," said Mayo, averaging 20.7 points in his last six games versus Golden State. "It is an emotional roller coaster. When things aren't going well, that is when the real men reveal their true colors." Slowing down Thompson could prove crucial for Milwaukee, as the Warriors are 18-3 when he makes at least three 3s compared to 5-10 when he doesn't. Thompson leads the NBA with 110 made 3s, and Curry is third with 106. Copyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
