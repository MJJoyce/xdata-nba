Aldridge looks to build on the best scoring game of his career when the visiting Trail Blazers try to win their third in a row overall and eighth straight over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. While Roy was undergoing arthroscopic surgery on both of his knees Monday, Aldridge was carrying Trail Blazers (22-20) to a 113-102 victory over Minnesota. He scored 37 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for his 20th double-double of the season. Roy has missed the last 16 games and the team is unsure when the star guard will return, making Aldridge's production all the more vital. "L.A. played like an All-Star tonight. His deep post position was great," coach Nate McMillan said Monday. Aldridge is averaging 21.1 points and 8.8 rebounds, both career bests, which could earn the fifth-year big man a trip to Los Angeles for the Feb. 20  All-Star game. For now, he's focused on helping his team move up from the eighth spot in the West. "People put more emphasis on it than I do. I can get caught up on who is an All-Star, or I'm trying to be an All-Star, and that's when you start to play bad," said Aldridge, averaging 26.5 points and 10.3 rebounds over the last 17 games. "If it happens, it happens." Portland got more bad news on the injury front Wednesday when it learned center Marcus Camby needs surgery to repair a partial meniscus tear in his left knee. Camby was injured against the Timberwolves and there is no timetable for his return. He's averaging 5.9 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.87 blocks in 39 games, all starts. That means Aldridge will have to shoulder even more of frontcourt load for the Blazers as they try to win three straight for the first time since Dec. 17-20. Portland will face a Kings team that returns home after a 1-5 trip. Sacramento (9-30) could easily have gone 3-3 on the eastern swing if not for poor second-half performances the last two games. After getting outscored 51-36 in the second half of a 110-106 loss to Detroit on Saturday, Sacramento had 36 points in the final 24 minutes of a 100-98 defeat to Atlanta on Monday. Coach Paul Westphal's team led the entire game until the Hawks went on a 20-4 fourth-quarter run. "We get 'em 47-38 on the boards, get nine more field-goal attempts (92-83), we only had seven turnovers for the game, it's just a shame," Westphal said. "We played hard, we played well against a really good team at the end of a six-game road trip and just came up that short." Coming up short against Portland has been commonplace for the Kings, whose most recent victory in the series was 103-86 at Arco Arena on April 11, 2008. The Trail Blazers have won their last three in Sacramento by an average of 16.0 points. Kings guard Tyreke Evans, who leads the team with 17.1 points per game, shot a combined 6 of 24 and averaged 8.0 points as Portland posted two road victories over Sacramento in 2009-10. The Blazers also won both home matchups to sweep the season series for the second straight time, with Aldridge averaging 19.3 points and 7.8 boards in the four contests. Portland returns to the Rose Garden following Wednesday's game and will face the Kings next Monday during a five-game homestand. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
