Nuggets-Timberwolves Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Feb 05 2011 2:40AM The Denver Nuggets have overcome two impressive performances by Minnesota's Kevin Love to continue their domination of the Timberwolves this season. After two close calls, the Nuggets hope they'll have an easier time against Love, newly named to the All-Star team, and the Timberwolves on Saturday night at the Target Center. On Friday, NBA Commissioner David Stern named Love, the league's leading rebounder, to the Western Conference All-Star roster as a replacement for Houston's Yao Ming. Love responded with 20 points and 15 rebounds, but Minnesota, (11-38), which has the NBA's second-worst record behind Cleveland, lost 111-100 at Toronto. "I'm truly humbled," Love said. "I wish things were going better for the team, but I'm looking forward to representing the Timberwolves on All-Star weekend." The Nuggets (29-21) can certainly vouch for Love's credentials. Love had a career-high 43 points and 17 rebounds in a 115-113 loss at Denver on Dec. 18, and collected 26 and 14 boards in a 119-113 home defeat Dec. 29. Denver, which has won four straight and 14 of 15 against Minnesota, is hoping it can continue that dominance as it looks to bounce back following a 113-106 loss to Utah on Friday. Carmelo Anthony scored 31 points and Nene tied his career high with 28, but the Jazz scored 63 points in the second half as Denver's defensive struggles continued. The Nuggets have given up 106.5 points in their last 11 games. "We lost our defensive focus in the second half," coach George Karl said. "It became an offensive game and I'm not sure that's how we should try to beat this team." After a two-game homestand, Denver is back on the road, looking to improve on an 8-15 record away from home. The Nuggets lost their last two road games, but have won seven straight at the Target Center. That winning streak is likely to continue Saturday with Minnesota (11-38) having lost 13 of 15. On Friday, Toronto shot 54.8 percent and scored 59 points in the first half as the team's defense was an issue again. The Timberwolves have allowed 111.3 points the last nine games. "Our defense was abysmal the entire ball game," coach Kurt Rambis said. "We didn't shut down anybody in their starting lineup. In all areas, their offense just completely dismantled what we wanted to do defensively." Minnesota hasn't had much better luck containing Denver, which has scored at least 100 points in nine straight meetings, averaging 111.7 points over that stretch. Making matters more difficult for the Timberwolves is the potential absence of forward Michael Beasley, who left late in the second quarter Friday with an injured left ankle and did not return. It's not certain if Beasley, averaging 19.9 points, will be available Saturday, although he couldn't put weight on the ankle when he left the court. "We've all got to step it up because he's a big scoring punch for us," Love said. "To lose him is really tough." Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
