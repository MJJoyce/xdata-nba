
 Mavericks-Grizzlies Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Nov 10 2010 11:10AM Led by Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry, the Dallas Mavericks converted down the stretch in their last game. The same could not be said of the team's effort last month versus the Memphis Grizzlies. Dallas looks to open 3-0 on the road for the first time in eight seasons Wednesday when it faces a Grizzlies club playing well since the return of All-Star forward Zach Randolph. Looking to avoid a third consecutive home loss, Dallas (4-2) halted Boston's five-game winning streak with an 89-87 victory Monday as Nowitzki and Terry combined for the game's final seven points. With a fresh buzz cut after a season-high seven turnovers and a scoreless fourth quarter in Saturday's 103-92 loss to Denver, Nowitzki scored 10 of his 25 in the fourth versus the Celtics and hit the game-winning jumper with 17.4 seconds left. "Dirk cut his hair," said Terry, who hit three 3-pointers and scored 17 points off the bench after starting the Mavericks' first five games. "He's back to his MVP status. Tonight, he wasn't going to settle." Nowitzki hit a go-ahead jumper with 1:10 left against Memphis on Oct. 29, but the Mavs didn't score again and lost 91-90. Terry missed a late jumper, then had a pass knocked out of bounds by Rudy Gay with 1.9 seconds left before O.J. Mayo stole Jason Kidd's inbounds pass as the Grizzlies ended a nine-game skid in Dallas. "Bad execution down the stretch," Nowitzki said after the Mavs were outscored by seven in the fourth against Memphis. "... It's a bad loss, a game we've got to win." The Grizzlies (4-4) won that matchup without Randolph, who also missed the next three games with a lower back contusion suffered in the team's season-opening loss to Atlanta. Memphis has won two of three since Randolph has returned as he's averaged 18.3 points and 15.0 rebounds. He posted his fifth career 20-20 game in Monday's 109-99 victory over Phoenix with season highs of 23 points and 20 rebounds. "It is huge to have the guy that cleans up all the boards and gives us extra possession," coach Lionel Hollins said. Randolph has averaged 23.9 points and 13.4 rebounds while posting eight straight double-doubles against Dallas. The 10-year veteran along with center Marc Gasol, who had 10 points and a season-best 15 rebounds last month in Dallas, will have to contend with Tyson Chandler, who is looking more comfortable in coach Rick Carlisle's system. The Mavericks newcomer recorded his first double-double of the season Monday with 12 points and 13 boards. "This type of win can catapult a team," Chandler said. "What it does is it gives everybody confidence in each other." The Mavericks are seeking their best start on the road since winning seven straight away from home to begin 2002-03. They had lost three in a row at Memphis before winning their last visit in overtime, 106-102 on March 31. Terry had 29 points and Nowitzki added 28, including 10 of the Mavs' final 11 in the fourth quarter as they rallied from a 13-point deficit with 4:25 left. Gay, among the league leaders with 26.5 points per game, is averaging just 15.0 on 40.9 percent shooting in eight career home games versus the Mavericks.
