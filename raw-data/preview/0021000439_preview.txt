Timberwolves-Cavaliers Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Dec 25 2010 7:27PM There haven't been many high points for the Minnesota Timberwolves this season, but their performance against the Cleveland Cavaliers earlier this month certainly qualifies as one. The Timberwolves look to snap a seven-game losing streak when they visit the Cavaliers on Sunday night, trying to sweep the season series for the first time in seven years. Minnesota (6-24) owns the league's second-worst record and is 1-17 on the road this season. Its record through 30 games is equal to last season's, when it tied a franchise-low with 15 victories. The Timberwolves' current skid has included two defeats by more than 20 points with the other five by fewer than 10. Minnesota fell 112-107 to Utah on Wednesday after giving up 41 fourth-quarter points while blowing a 12-point advantage. It was the seventh time the Timberwolves have lost despite holding a double-digit lead. "It's a repeated story for us," coach Kurt Rambis said. "We're close, but we just can't do the right things late in close ball games." Kevin Love had 25 points and 19 rebounds while Michael Beasley added 24 and 10. Rambis' club, though, had little trouble putting away the Cavaliers (8-21) earlier this season, beating them 129-95 on Dec. 4. Love had 28 points and 19 rebounds as the Timberwolves led by as many as 40. Minnesota, which has dropped 12 straight on the road since a 98-89 victory over Sacramento on Nov. 10, is looking to snap a four-game losing streak in Cleveland. With a victory, it would sweep the season series for the first time since 2003-04. Love and Beasley, who missed the last meeting with the Cavs because of a sprained ankle, will try for another dominating inside game against a Cleveland team that has lost 12 of 13. Even without Beasley, who is averaging 6.1 boards, Minnesota outrebounded the Cavaliers 46-29. The Cavs are coming off a 98-84 loss at Atlanta on Wednesday. They trailed by three at the half, then the Hawks opened the third quarter with a 20-10 run, finishing the game shooting 50.6 percent. Cleveland is allowing opponents to average 106.6 points on 49.5-percent shooting the last 13 games. It's also been outrebounded in four of the last five contests. "We just have to continue to stay positive and continue to work, and hopefully we turn things around," forward Antawn Jamison said. Mo Williams continued his strong play recently with 18 points and 11 assists for his fourth straight double-double. He's averaging 19.8 points and 11.5 assists during that stretch. However, Williams was held to four points and four assists in 19 minutes against the Timberwolves earlier this month. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
