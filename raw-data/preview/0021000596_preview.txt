Lakers-Clippers Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Jan 15 2011 4:29PM The Los Angeles Clippers nearly pulled off a win over the Los Angeles Lakers in their first matchup this season before Derek Fisher's buzzer-beating layup finished a late rally. While they're playing some of their best basketball lately, the Clippers on Sunday could have trouble again getting past the Lakers, who seek their second eight-game winning streak of the season. The Clippers (13-25) held a five-point lead over their rivals with 1:14 remaining on Dec. 8, but fell 87-86. After making the go-ahead basket with 16 seconds left, DeAndre Jordan just missed in his attempt to block Fisher's shot. That loss came during a 5-21 start for the Clippers, but they have won eight of 12 since then with young stars Blake Griffin and Eric Gordon leading the way. Griffin has a team-record 25 consecutive double-doubles and scored at least 20 points in each of the past 14 games. Gordon's team-best 28 points on Friday at Golden State gave him four consecutive games with at least 25, but the Clippers were denied their first four-game win streak in three seasons with a 122-112 loss. "We can't let down just because we lost this game," Gordon said. "We have some big games coming up. This is a lesson. We just have to get back to playing basketball like we were." Getting back in the win column could prove a little difficult against the rival Lakers (30-11), who have outscored opponents by an average of 18.2 points during their current run. Kobe Bryant, though, still saw at least one area where his team could get better after Friday's 100-88 win over New Jersey at Staples Center. "We blew so many coverages defensively - I think it's noticeable. We held them to 42 percent from the field, so that's not bad, but we still feel like we can improve," he said. Bryant scored 27 points to lead five players in double figures after tallying 39 in a 115-110 road victory over the Warriors on Wednesday. After shooting 10 of 19 from the floor against the Nets, Bryant has shot 47.7 percent during the Lakers' winning streak. "I think he's got a real good game-mind going with himself. He's taking and picking his spots," coach Phil Jackson said. Bryant has averaged 30.0 points in his last four games against the Clippers and made nine of 15 shots while scoring 24 against them on Dec. 8. Griffin had 16 points and 11 rebounds in his first game against the Lakers, and Gordon matched his best scoring performance in eight career matchups with 24 points. The Lakers will try to match their longest winning streak when they opened the season 8-0, and while in the middle of a grueling stretch. They've notched their seven straight wins in an 11-day span and will play four games in the next five days including this contest. "It's a huge challenge," Bryant said. "I mean, the Clippers have been playing extremely well. ... They gave us a tough one last time we played them, and I'm sure Sunday will be no different." After winning nine in a row over the Clippers, the Lakers have split the past four matchups. They played without Bryant during a 107-91 loss in last season's finale and without Pau Gasol in a 102-91 defeat on Jan. 6, 2010. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
