Trail Blazers-Rockets Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Jan 05 2011 1:38AM Portland didn't have too much trouble beating Houston at home last weekend. Repeating that feat on the road could be more difficult. Meeting for the second time in four days, the Trail Blazers look to avoid a seventh consecutive road loss to the Rockets on Wednesday night. Portland (18-17) held the Rockets to 41.3-percent shooting and their lowest point total of the season in a 100-85 win Sunday. The Trail Blazers can only hope to be as good in Houston where they've averaged 86.4 points while losing 12 of 13. Though their last two games at the Toyota Center have each been decided by four points, the Trail Blazers' road struggles have not been limited to Houston. Portland fell to 6-14 away from home after Tuesday's 84-81 loss at Dallas. The Trail Blazers have lost three times in nine games, all on the road. Playing a ninth straight game without injured star swingman Brandon Roy (knee), LaMarcus Aldridge had 28 points with 10 rebounds and Marcus Camby added 10 points and pulled down a season high-tying 20 boards, but the Trail Blazers couldn't hold a five-point fourth-quarter lead. "We need to stay focused," coach Nate McMillan told the Trail Blazers' official website. "You've got to make plays down the stretch. When it's winning time, you have to make those plays." McMillan hopes his club can keep its focus while trying for its first win in Houston since April 6, 2007. Aldridge had 25 points with 11 rebounds against the Rockets on Sunday. He's averaged 26.7 points last three games overall, but 22.0 during the Blazers' six-game skid at Houston. Though the Rockets (16-18) have dominated Portland at home and won nine of 10 overall there, they hope to play much better after opening 2011 with the loss to the Blazers and a 113-106 defeat at Denver the next night. "We had a bad game in Portland and we just didn't play well (against Denver)," forward Brad Miller told the Rockets' official website. "Coming in, it is tough month for us and we (have) to step it up and play a little bit better." The Rockets combined to shoot 42.2 percent in their last two games, but have shot 47.2 percent and averaged 108.0 points during their last 10 home contests. Returning to friendly surroundings could be what the Rockets need to regain their hunger. "We have to go out there and play with a sense of urgency every single night," said guard Kyle Lowry, who scored 21 against the Nuggets. "We're not 20 games over .500, we have to go out there and play with a sense of urgency every single night." Kevin Martin is averaging a team-leading 22.6 points this season, but has totaled 23 on 9-of-32 shooting the last two games. Martin scored 15 at Portland, and has averaged 12.3 points and shot 32.5 percent in his last three games against the Trail Blazers. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
