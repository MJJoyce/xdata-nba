Knicks-Cavaliers Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Jan 25 2012 1:18AM Despite the worst offensive performance of Carmelo Anthony's career, the New York Knicks found a way to end their season-high six-game losing streak. Now if they could only find a way to win a game in Cleveland. New York will try to end its eight-game skid visiting the Cavaliers on Wednesday night when these teams meet. Since sitting a game after suffering a sprained right ankle and injuring his left wrist against Memphis on Jan. 12, Anthony is averaging 21.2 points - but shooting only 31.3 percent from the field. He missed all seven of his shots and finished with a career-low one point in 30 minutes of Tuesday's 111-78 victory at Charlotte. Tyson Chandler, who finished with 20 points and a season high-tying 17 rebounds, and Amare Stoudemire (18 points, eight boards) did much of the heavy lifting in the Knicks' first victory since Jan. 11 versus Philadelphia. "I needed a night like this where I didn't have to do too much and we still won the game by a lot," said Anthony, who also grabbed 11 rebounds - tying his season high. "We got a long road trip (three games in four nights) ahead of us. We got another one tomorrow at Cleveland so it's another day. This one is over. We won a game, team effort. Get ready for tomorrow." Anthony is averaging 33.3 points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists in his last three games at Cleveland. The last time he played at Quicken Loans Arena, Anthony fouled out after scoring 27 points and pulling down eight rebounds in a 115-109 loss Feb. 25. That was his Knicks road debut after being acquired from Denver three days earlier. Thanks in large part to LeBron James, Cleveland has not lost at home to New York (7-10) since a 101-98 loss on Nov. 29, 2006. The Knicks, though, snapped an 11-game skid to the Cavaliers on April 3 with a 123-107 victory. Anthony had 25 points in that game, and Stoudemire added 28 with seven boards as New York clinched its first playoff spot in seven seasons. Not many expected the Cavaliers (6-10) to be in the playoff mix after finishing an Eastern Conference-worst 19-63 last season, but the addition of No. 1 overall pick Kyrie Irving has given the club plenty of optimism. Cleveland, though, needs its 19-year-old point guard to take better care of the ball. Irving has a team-high 18 turnovers during a four-game losing streak after giving the ball away three times in Tuesday's 92-85 loss at Miami. "We kind of beat ourselves tonight," said Irving, who finished with a team-high 17 points and four assists. "We had 22 turnovers and we lost by seven points." That's still a step in the right direction after the Cavs lost their previous two to Chicago and Atlanta by a combined 66 points. "Stayed in the game for 48 minutes," coach Byron Scott said. Keeping the Knicks off the boards could help the Cavs stay in this game. The possible return of rookie Tristan Thompson, who missed Tuesday's game with a sprained left ankle, could help Antawn Jamison and Anderson Varejao against Chandler, who is averaging 14.0 rebounds and 12.0 points in his last four games. Stoudemire led the Knicks with 30.8 points and 9.5 rebounds per game versus Cleveland in 2010-11. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
