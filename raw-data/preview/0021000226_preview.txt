76ers-Heat Preview By MATT BECKER Posted Nov 25 2010 2:34PM The Miami Heat are off to a worst start than last season - not exactly what they envisioned when they brought together LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. A home game against the Philadelphia 76ers might help them take some of the pressure off. The Heat (8-7) look to snap a season-high three-game losing streak Friday night when they host the 76ers, who are in last place in the Eastern Conference. Miami has hardly played like a title contender despite the presence of its star trio. The Heat, 9-6 through 15 games in 2009-10, fell 104-95 at Orlando on Wednesday. They have gone 3-5 in their last eight. "If we had the answer right now, we wouldn't be sitting at one game over .500," said James, who scored 25 points. "We're a few games out of first. We're a few games out of eighth." Wade had another poor shooting night, finishing with 18 points on 6 of 21 from the floor. He has averaged 10.7 points on 23.4 percent shooting in his last three games, but doesn't seemed too concerned about Miami's slower-than-expected start. "Right now we just got to continue to stay the course," the six-time All-Star said. "We'll have a lot of wins when it's all said and done." For that to happen, Miami will eventually have to figure out a way to beat good teams. The Heat are 1-6 against opponents with winning records, averaging 94.6 points on 42.0 percent shooting. They have scored 106.3 points and shot 50.6 percent against teams below .500. The 76ers (3-12) have one of the worst records in the league, and Heat have already taken advantage of facing them once. Miami beat Philadelphia 97-87 on Oct. 27 for its first victory. Wade scored 30 points, James had 16 and Bosh chipped in 15 for the Heat, who led by as many as 26. Miami has won five straight in the series and four consecutive meetings at AmericanAirlines Arena. Philadelphia, 1-8 on the road, is coming off a 106-90 loss to Toronto on Wednesday, its seventh defeat in eight games. Andre Iguodala had 17 points and Jrue Holiday scored 16 for the 76ers, who were without Elton Brand. The power forward was suspended one game for committing a flagrant foul in Tuesday's defeat in Washington. "It's tough for us to come down and throw the ball in the post and calm the game down because we don't have a post presence without him," coach Doug Collins said. Lou Williams struggling with his shot doesn't help either. The guard had eight points and shot 1 of 11 from the field Wednesday after finishing with four points against the Wizards. He is averaging 7.8 points on 23.6 percent shooting in his last eight games after averaging 17.9 in the first seven. "Lou is just not shooting well," Collins said. "He's in one of those ruts and we need him to make shots because he's an integral part of our team coming off the bench." Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
