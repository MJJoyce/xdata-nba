Bobcats-76ers Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Jan 14 2014 11:35PM Al Jefferson hasn't fully lived up to expectations since the Charlotte Bobcats signed him in the offseason, though his sore right ankle has been the likely culprit. After Jefferson's best performance of the season helped end a losing streak, the Bobcats now look to avoid dropping a sixth straight road meeting with the slumping Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night. Charlotte (16-23) had lost three in a row entering Tuesday's contest with the New York Knicks, with Jefferson averaging 11.3 points and shooting 40 percent from the field in that stretch. His average of 16.8 points is his lowest since 2006-07, and his 45.2 field-goal percentage is the worst of his career after signing a three-year, $41 million contract. The 6-foot-10 forward, though, scored a season-high 35 points Tuesday in a 108-98 victory for the Bobcats, who won for just the second time in 10 games. Jefferson admitted he may need to have surgery after the season. "It worked for me tonight - on my jump shot, on my jump hook," said Jefferson, who missed nine games in November with the ankle injury. "I just decided to try to do something different to get some lift." Jefferson finished 14 of 20 from the field and grabbed eight rebounds. "You could tell from the first time he touched the ball he was on the attack," coach Steve Clifford said. Kemba Walker scored 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and Gerald Henderson added 17. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist finished with eight points and seven rebounds in his return from a broken left hand that caused him to miss the last 19 games. "You can see value of having a guy like Kidd-Gilchrist," Clifford said. "People don't always understand the energy and intensity and those kinds of things. Those are skills." Jefferson had 14 points and 12 rebounds but shot just 6 of 21 in the last meeting with Philadelphia, while Walker finished with 18 points and 10 assists to help the Bobcats earn a 105-88 home win Dec. 6. Charlotte hasn't won in Philadelphia since March 10, 2010, but the 76ers have dropped three straight at home and four consecutive overall after falling 102-92 to the Knicks on Saturday. James Anderson scored 17 points and hit 8 of 13 from the field for Philadelphia (12-25), which had trouble finding a rhythm on offense. "We came out moving the ball, sharing the ball. I thought that we got stagnant," coach Brett Brown said. "You have to do off-the-ball stuff (offensively), and we really didn't." Spencer Hawes, who had 17 points, agreed with his coach. "When we move the ball on offense, everything seems to click better for us," Hawes said. "We keep ourselves out of having to play much transition defense." Philadelphia has allowed at least 102 points in all but four of its games and ranks last in the NBA in scoring defense, giving up an average of 110.9. Brown wasn't unhappy with the latest effort, though. "By and large I thought we played fairly good defense," Brown said. "It's a bearable numbers - 102 points. It wasn't a bad defensive effort." The Sixers have held the Bobcats to an average of 84.6 points during their home winning streak in the series. Copyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
