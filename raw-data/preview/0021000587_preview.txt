Rockets-Hawks Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 15 2011 2:43AM The Atlanta Hawks are on the verge of matching their longest winning streak of the season thanks in large part to Jamal Crawford's recent play. Looking for a sixth straight win overall, the Hawks will try for an 11th consecutive home victory when they face the struggling Houston Rockets on Saturday night. Atlanta (26-14) has played only one game in the last six days, defeating Toronto 104-101 on Wednesday night - a day after the Hawks' home meeting with Milwaukee was postponed due to a winter storm. Mike Bibby made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 8.2 seconds remaining, but it was Crawford who earned high praise from teammates for his season-high 36-point effort. "He's a guy who can really heat up and score in bunches and he did that (Wednesday)," Joe Johnson said of Crawford. "He was basically unstoppable in the first half. When you've got guys like that coming off the bench, you're a tough team." Last season's NBA sixth man of the year, Crawford is averaging 27.2 points - 10.6 more than his season mark - in his last six games while going 19 of 41 from 3-point range (46.3 percent). The Hawks are 9-3 when he scores at least 20 points. Johnson, too, has too come up big during his team's five-game run, averaging 27.2 points on 52.1 percent shooting from the field. The Hawks haven't won six straight since starting the season 6-0. Their 10-game home winning streak - in which they've defeated opponents by an average of 11.1 points - is the second-longest active run in the league behind San Antonio's 14 in a row. The overall winning streak has come entirely with Marvin Williams sidelined due to a back injury. Although Williams has averaged 20.5 points in his last two games versus Houston, he's unlikely to return for this game. Atlanta had lost three straight to the Rockets before taking the last three meetings by a combined 12 points. Despite leading by as many as 16 points in the third quarter Friday night against New Orleans, the Rockets (17-23) lost 110-105 in overtime as they allowed at least 100 points for a 10th consecutive game - their longest such stretch since surrendering 100-plus points in 25 straight from March 8-April 24, 1988. Following a season-best five-game winning streak, Houston finds itself mired in a 2-8 skid. "You've got to make it not happen," guard Kyle Lowry said of the late-game collapse. "You've got to take some type of stand and not let that happen. We went through a good stretch where we were finishing games very good. But we're going back through a stretch where we are finishing games bad." Lowry scored a career high-tying 28 points Friday while Kevin Martin returned after missing two games with a sore right wrist and finished with 26. Martin, who ranks 11th in the league with 23.3 points per game, is averaging 29.5 in his last four games and 28.8 in his last four versus Atlanta. The Rockets, though, have struggled from long distance in their last five games, shooting 30.0 percent from beyond the arc, and things aren't about to get any easier against a Hawks team holding opponents to an NBA-low 32.2 percent from 3-point range.
