Spurs-Jazz Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Nov 14 2013 4:04PM The Utah Jazz finally notched their first win this week. Their chances of picking up another victory when they face the surging San Antonio Spurs would appear bleak. Perhaps the only solace for the Jazz is that San Antonio has lost each of its last two regular-season visits to Utah, but the Spurs will be seeking a seventh consecutive win when they make their next one Friday night. The Jazz started 0-8 for the first time since losing their inaugural 11 games in 1974-75 while based in New Orleans. They finally ended that drought Wednesday with a 111-105 victory over New Orleans' current team, the Pelicans. Gordon Hayward led the way with 27 points and 10 assists, Richard Jefferson scored 22 after totaling 20 points in his previous three games, and Enes Kanter had 21 points with 10 rebounds. "I feel great for these guys," coach Tyrone Corbin said. "We've been through a lot of struggles, but there's no quit in them." The Jazz (1-8) entered that game not only as the NBA's lone winless team but also last in scoring (86.9 points per game), field-goal percentage (40.1) and 3-point percentage (22.9). They had easily their best shooting night of the season, hitting 51.4 percent from the field and 9 of 22 on 3-pointers, while reaching 100 points for the first time. "It's definitely fun when guys are making shots and you're whipping the ball around from side to side. And we were getting some stops, too," said Hayward, who scored 22 in the second half to help his team erase a 16-point deficit. Utah's quest for back-to-back wins will come against one of the league's best defensive teams. San Antonio (8-1) is allowing a Western Conference-low 90.1 points per game, including 86.2 during its six-game win streak. The Spurs limited Washington to 36.3 percent shooting in a 92-79 victory Wednesday. "Defensively, that's where we want to be," said Tony Parker, who led six players in double figures with 16 points. "We're going to try to keep getting better. Right now, it's pretty good." San Antonio has won 12 of the last 14 meetings with Utah, including an opening-round playoff sweep in 2012, but fell 99-96 in its most recent visit to Salt Lake City on Dec. 12. The Jazz's two leading scorers from that game, however, are no longer on the team (Paul Millsap, Al Jefferson), and neither is the player who made the winning 3-pointer at the buzzer (Mo Williams). The Spurs, meanwhile, still have their two leading scorers from that game in Parker and Tim Duncan, but Duncan is averaging 7.0 points on 5-of-27 shooting in the last three games. "It happens. I don't worry about Tim. He'll be fine. He needs to keep shooting," Parker said. Duncan averaged 20.0 points and 16.0 rebounds in last season's three meetings with Utah while Parker scored 22.7 per game. Hayward, averaging 24.3 points in his last three games, has averaged 9.0 in 13 matchups with the Spurs on 33.3 percent shooting. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
