Cavaliers-Wizards Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Apr 13 2012 11:50PM With the playoffs out of the picture, all that's left for the Washington Wizards and Cleveland Cavaliers to do is salvage something positive in the final weeks of the season. The Wizards look to bounce back from another embarrassing defeat and continue their recent success against the visiting Cavaliers on Saturday night. After winning 113-85 at Charlotte on Monday and 93-85 the next night at home over Orlando, Washington (14-45) reverted back to its old form in a 103-65 loss at New York on Friday. Jordan Crawford scored 17 points as the Wizards recorded their second-lowest point total of 2011-12 while shooting a season-low 27.8 percent. Continuing to play without injured starters Nene (plantar fasciitis), Trevor Booker (plantar fasciitis) and Rashard Lewis (knee), the Wizards went 4 of 20 from 3-point range and committed 22 turnovers. Point guard John Wall was 2 for 12 from the field and finished with eight points and seven turnovers. "It's embarrassing is what it was," coach Randy Wittman said. "Our effort was uncharacteristic of what we have been doing. I don't know. It looked like we were overwhelmed from the jump ball when we walked in the arena. Maybe that happens to young guys." The only team with a worse record in the NBA than the Wizards is Charlotte (7-51). Those two clubs are the only ones lower than Cleveland (19-38) in the Eastern Conference. "The thing in this league is you've got to bring it every night," said Wizards guard Roger Mason Jr., who had 11 points and six rebounds Friday. "Thank God we have a game (Saturday) and try to make up for it." Washington has won three of four against the Cavaliers, including the last two at home. Crawford scored 31 points and Wall added 24 in a 101-98 victory in the nation's capital in the teams' only meeting this season March 3. Crawford is averaging 26.0 points, 7.0 assists and 6.5 rebounds while making 21 of 40 shots in the last two games against the Cavaliers at the Verizon Center. Cleveland began its stretch of three games in three nights Friday by falling to Indiana for the second time in three days, 102-83. Omri Casspi matched a season high with a team-best 14 points off the bench as the Cavaliers shot 35.4 percent and were outscored 34-13 during a game-changing third quarter. "We did a bad job of playing 48 minutes," said veteran forward Antawn Jamison, who was held to 12 points. "The second half, we had a lot of open shots and we didn't convert on them." The Cavaliers continue to play without star rookie Kyrie Irving, who is likely to miss a seventh consecutive game with a sprained shoulder. Irving is averaging 18.8 points and 5.7 assists. Journeyman guard Lester Hudson had averaged 23.3 points in the previous four games while playing on his second 10-day contract before being held to seven Friday. Jamison had 29 points, nine rebounds, five assists, four steals and two blocks against the Wizards last month. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
