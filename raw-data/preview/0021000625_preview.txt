Kevin Love's stellar play hasn't had the same effect for the Minnesota Timberwolves. When two of the NBA's top young forwards meet again Wednesday night, the Clippers will try to earn their 11th win in 15 games while the visiting Timberwolves will attempt to avoid their eighth loss in nine contests. Griffin had a career-high 47 points - the most in an NBA game this season through Monday - in a 114-107 home victory over Indiana. Known for his high-flying dunks, he showcased a mixture of turnaround jumpers, hook shots and bank shots while topping his 44-point performance against New York on Nov. 20. "It's cool because all I hear is, 'He can dunk and jumps high,'" said Griffin, who was 19 of 24 from the field. "People question the other skills and as a basketball player, you take that personally." With 14 rebounds, Griffin also extended his franchise record for consecutive double-doubles to 27. He's averaged 26.7 points and 14.0 rebounds during the Clippers' 10-4 stretch from Dec. 17-Jan. 17, among the league's top five in both categories during that span. Los Angeles (15-25) has won five in a row at Staples Center - the only time it had a longer home winning streak in the past four years was a six-game run last season - and might have a good chance to extend this streak with a visit from Minnesota. The Timberwolves (10-32) have the Western Conference's worst road record (2-20) but it's not from a lack of help from Love, who recorded his 28th consecutive double-double in a 113-102 loss at Portland on Monday night. With 22 points and 17 rebounds, Love also maintained the league lead for double-doubles. He has a career-high 37, four more than Griffin in second place. Minnesota, though, shot 67.6 percent from the free-throw line and committed 16 turnovers Monday. The Timberwolves, averaging a league-worst 17.1 turnovers, fell to 1-10 when making less than 70 percent at the foul line. "We have to do a much better job of taking care of the basketball. We have better free throw shooters than we demonstrated tonight," coach Kurt Rambis said. Love has averaged 23.1 points and 16.6 rebounds during his run of consecutive double-doubles, but the Timberwolves are 6-22 over that span. He's averaged 22.9 points and 17.3 rebounds during the team's current 1-7 stretch. He helped Minnesota to a 113-111 win over the Clippers on Nov. 17 with 24 points and 14 rebounds. Michael Beasley hit the tiebreaking jumper with 2.3 seconds left during a 33-point performance. Griffin had 26 points and 17 rebounds in that defeat, then had 22 and 10 in a 113-90 victory over the Timberwolves in Los Angeles on Dec. 20. Eric Gordon had a season-high 36 points in that win after scoring 30 in the November defeat. He's averaged 26.7 points while helping the Clippers win five of six overall. Love, meanwhile, was held to 12 points and 10 rebounds in Minnesota's third straight road loss to the Clippers, while Beasley had a team-best 20 points. Beasley scored 12 in his return from a sprained ankle Monday. The teams meet for the final time this season Feb. 16 at the Target Center. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
