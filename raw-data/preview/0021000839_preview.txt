Pacers-Wizards Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Feb 21 2011 5:35PM Frank Vogel has been able to retool the Indiana Pacers' offense. Now the interim coach needs to tune up the defense. The Pacers look to avoid a third straight loss when they return from the All-Star break to face the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night. Since Jim O'Brien was fired Jan. 30, Indiana (24-30) has won seven of 10 to move into eighth place in the Eastern Conference, two games back of seventh-place Philadelphia. The Pacers are averaging 107.3 points under Vogel - 9.5 more than before the coaching switch - but have allowed 102.5 per game in the last 10. "This is part of the process of changing a team in midseason," Vogel said after the Pacers' last game, a 115-109 overtime defeat at Detroit on Wednesday. "I knew focusing on offense and neglecting defense would come back and bite us at some point, and that's what happened." The Pacers, though, may not need their best defensive effort against a Washington team that's scored more than 100 points once in its last nine games. The Wizards (15-39) enjoyed plenty of exposure during All-Star weekend, with John Wall recording 22 assists to earn MVP honors of the rookie challenge and JaVale McGee finishing second in the slam dunk contest. Washington, though, returns from the break with the third-worst record in the East. The Wizards snapped a franchise-record 26-game road losing streak Feb. 13, but without leading scorer Nick Young (sore knee), the team was routed 101-76 at Orlando in its last game Wednesday. "We were outmanned," said coach Flip Saunders, whose team last won two straight Jan. 15-17. "Not having Nick hurt a lot. I thought we played really hard the first half, but couldn't make a shot. It was one of those things, the harder we tried the harder we fell. It was like being in quicksand." Washington has dropped 12 of 15, but has won two straight and six of eight at home against Indiana. The Wizards took the first matchup at the Verizon Center 104-90 on Dec. 29, with Young scoring 25 points to lead six Washington players in double figures. Indiana avoided a home-and-home sweep two days later with a 95-86 victory. Pacers center Roy Hibbert - averaging 17.8 points and 7.9 rebounds under Vogel - had 17 points and eight boards Dec. 31 after scoring five points with four rebounds in 15 foul-plagued minutes two days before. The former Georgetown standout had a career-high 29 points in Indiana's previous visit to the nation's capital - a 98-97 season-ending loss April 14. Hibbert matched that total Wednesday.
