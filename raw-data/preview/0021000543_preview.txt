Jazz-Rockets Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Jan 08 2011 1:23AM It's been more than a year since Utah lost three straight games in the same regular season. Facing the struggling Houston Rockets could help the Jazz prevent it from happening again. After dropping consecutive games for the second time in 2010-11, the visiting Jazz look to get back on track by handing the Rockets a fifth straight loss Saturday night. Utah (24-13) had won six of eight before falling 110-87 to Atlanta on Wednesday and 110-99 at Memphis on Friday, allowing the Hawks and Grizzlies to shoot a combined 50.0 percent. "I don't like the taste of it," coach Jerry Sloan said. "I hope (the players) don't." Though the Jazz were swept in four games by the Los Angeles Lakers in the second round of the 2010 playoffs, they have not dropped three consecutive regular-season contests in the same season since Dec. 31, 2009-Jan. 4, 2010. Utah has won four of six overall against Houston (16-20), but if the Jazz are to continue that success against the Rockets they'll need to play better than they did Friday against the Grizzlies. Paul Millsap returned from a one-game absence with a sore hip to score 20 points while Deron Williams added 19 but went 4 of 13 from the field. The point guard also committed five of Utah's season-high 23 turnovers. "We can't win with 20-plus turnovers, and it starts with me," said Williams, who has a 2.72 assist-to-turnover ratio. The Jazz have lost three of their last four visits to Houston. Williams (22.1 points per game) was held to 12 points in a 113-96 loss at the Toyota Center in the teams' most recent meeting April 7. A strong game from Millsap could help Utah bounce back. Millsap had 13 points with 11 rebounds in the last meeting with the Rockets, and has averaged 19.0 and 9.3 boards his last three games overall. The Rockets, who started the season 0-5, fell 110-95 at Orlando on Friday for their fourth consecutive loss. Coming off a 45-point effort in a home loss to Portland on Wednesday, Kevin Martin had 27, but the Rockets blew a nine-point first-half lead, gave up 39 third-quarter points and allowed the Magic to shoot 51.7 percent for the game. The Rockets shot 41.5 percent from the field, including 5 of 18 from 3-point range. "We fell apart in the third quarter," Houston coach Rick Adelman said. "We struggled offensively, we just gave in at the other end." The Rockets have given up an average of 109.3 points while losing five of six. They've allowed an average of 111.0 while dropping two of three to the Jazz. Martin has made 21 of 33 shots the last two games, and 28 of 51 from the field while averaging 31.0 points in his last three versus Utah. Houston could be without starting forward Chuck Hayes for a sixth consecutive game because of a sprained ankle. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
