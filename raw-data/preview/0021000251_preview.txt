Hornets-Thunder Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Nov 29 2010 2:11AM Last season, the Oklahoma City Thunder took advantage of Chris Paul's absence to beat the New Orleans Hornets for the first time since relocating from Seattle. The Thunder will now have to contend with Paul when they host the Hornets for the first time this season Monday night. Paul played in each of New Orleans' 10 consecutive wins in this series spanning nearly three calendar years, but the All-Star point guard missed a Feb. 3 matchup while preparing for arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. Oklahoma City won 103-99. With Paul still recovering from surgery, the Thunder also claimed a 98-83 home victory March 10. David West scored 33 points but no other Hornets player had more than 11. Now healthy, Paul will try to help his club prevail in a matchup of teams that have cooled off lately. The Hornets have dropped three of four since opening 11-1 for the first time in franchise history. They gave up a season high for points in Sunday's 109-95 loss to San Antonio after previously allowing a league-low 91.1 per game. After building a 17-point halftime lead, New Orleans (12-4) was outscored 65-34 over the final 24 minutes and 37-18 in the fourth quarter. "We've got to execute better on offense and push the tempo. That's my fault," Paul said. "I pushed it in the first half and I guess I didn't in the second half and they were able to get their defense set. I've got to pick up the pace." Oklahoma City (11-6) has dropped two of three - including a 99-98 loss at Houston on Sunday night - after winning a season-high five in a row. The Thunder rallied from an eight-point halftime, and were within a point with 29 seconds left, but Kevin Durant missed a short jumper just before the buzzer. "We battled back and no one on our team gave up and we had a shot to win," coach Scott Brooks said. "Kevin's shot was on line but just a little short. We had a chance to win down the stretch." The league's scoring leader (27.4 ppg), Durant finished with 18 points after scoring no fewer than 23 in his previous 10 games. Russell Westbrook had 23 points after scoring a career-high 43 in a 110-106 overtime win at Indiana on Friday night. Durant has shined against the Hornets, averaging 32.6 points and shooting 56.7 percent the last five times he's faced them. Paul has averaged 20.5 points and 11.6 assists in his last eight games versus the Thunder, who haven't beaten the Hornets in Oklahoma City when he's been in the lineup.
