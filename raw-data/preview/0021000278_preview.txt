Coming off a successful first game minus the injured four-time All-Star, the Hawks look to extend their winning streak to five games Friday night against the visiting Philadelphia 76ers. Hours after learning Johnson (17.1 points per game, 5.2 assists per game) would undergo elbow surgery that will sideline him four to six weeks, six Atlanta players scored in double figures during Wednesday's 112-109 home win over Memphis. "It shows that we can handle adversity," said guard Jamal Crawford, who had 16 points and eight assists. "Joe is our franchise player, and we can't wait to have him back. But for now, everybody else has to step up." Al Horford had 20 points while Josh Powell scored a season-high 16 off the bench and Mike Bibby added 15 as the Hawks (12-7) improved to 15-20 when Johnson is out of the lineup since the guard joined the team in 2005-06. Johnson had the surgery Thursday and will begin rehab Friday. "We knew we had to do it collectively," Horford said. "Obviously we'll miss Joe. At the same time it's going to make us stronger as a team." The Hawks' four game winning streak is their longest since they opened the season 6-0 - a run which included a 104-101 victory at Philadelphia on Oct. 29.  Horford had 20 points with 12 rebounds and Crawford added 19 points in that contest. Crawford has averaged 18.8 points on 52.1 percent shooting in his last four games versus the Sixers. "They have so much offense," 76ers coach Doug Collins told the team's official website. "They have a lot of fire power. They are very athletic." While Atlanta is averaging 105.8 points during its winning streak, the 76ers (5-13) have not allowed more than 86 points in consecutive victories over New Jersey and Portland. They limited the Trail Blazers to 11 fourth-quarter points and 37.0 percent shooting overall in a 88-79 home win Tuesday. "I am so pleased with the way our guys are playing defense. They are terrific," said Collins, whose club will now try to win three in a row for the first time since a five-game streak Jan. 31-Feb. 9. It figures to be a challenge. The 76ers are 1-9 on the road, where they have given up an average of 106.6 points during a seven-game skid. However, Philadelphia has split its last four games in Atlanta. Elton Brand, who scored a team-high 18 points against Portland, had 20 with eight rebounds against the Hawks earlier this season. Teammate Andre Iguodala had a season-high 27 points with 10 assists in that contest but was held to seven points Tuesday. He's averaged 20.8 points and 8.5 assists in his last six games versus Atlanta. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
