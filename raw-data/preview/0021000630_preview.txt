Raptors-Magic Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Jan 20 2011 5:06PM After a sub-par road trip, the Orlando Magic returned home and earned a dramatic win their last time out. Another victory would give them their longest home winning streak in two years - and continue the Toronto Raptors' slide. Orlando seeks its eighth consecutive victory at the Amway Center on Friday night against Toronto, loser of five straight. The Magic (27-15) concluded a 2-3 trip Monday with a 109-106 loss to Boston, which was their third in four games following a season-high nine-game win streak. Behind 4-point plays from Jason Richardson toward the end of regulation and J.J. Redick in overtime, Orlando extended its home winning streak with a 99-98 victory Wednesday against Philadelphia. The Magic haven't had an eight-game run at home since winning 11 straight Nov. 24, 2008-Jan. 9, 2009. "The season is long and there will be time periods when we have down games, and a stretch when we go on a win streak," Redick said. "You can't pinpoint one game, but hopefully this will start another winning streak." Six of eight players scored in double figures, and Richardson's conversion with 17 seconds remaining helped send the game into overtime. However, he finished 2 for 11 from the field for eight points - his lowest total since scoring five Christmas Day. Dwight Howard, who fouled out with 18 points Wednesday and shot 10 of 22 from the free throw line, scored 25 in a 110-106 home loss against Toronto on Nov. 12. It was the first of only five road wins this season for the Raptors (13-29), who have lost four straight and eight of 10 away from home. Toronto had Western Conference-leading San Antonio on the ropes Wednesday, leading by 11 at halftime before falling 104-95. The Raptors were outscored 33-16 in the third quarter and blew a double-digit lead for the second straight game. DeMar DeRozan scored 28 points for Toronto, which lost for the ninth time in 11 games. The Raptors are 3-8 when DeRozan scores 20 or more. "It's definitely frustrating," DeRozan said. "We were beating up on one of the best teams in the NBA, but we got to hold the lead. It's definitely frustrating." Toronto likely will need a complete effort to end its skid Friday, much like it put together against Orlando earlier this season. DeRozan scored 26 points, Andrea Bargnani had a game-high 27, and Sonny Weems broke a 103-all tie with 7.1 seconds left with a 3-pointer over Howard. It may be difficult to knock off the Magic a second time unless Bargnani steps up his game. He's a combined 10 for 37 from the field, including 2 of 12 from 3-point range, for 25 points in his last two games. Bargnani had averaged 28.0 points and shot 51.7 percent in the four games prior. The Raptors have won two in a row in the series, both in Orlando, after losing three straight meetings. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
