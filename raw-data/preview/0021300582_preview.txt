Bobcats-Magic Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Jan 16 2014 4:16PM After failing to capitalize on one of their best chances to snap a lengthy losing streak, the Orlando Magic will try to end their woes when they face another struggling Southeast Division team. The Charlotte Bobcats will seek to avoid their 10th loss in 12 games by sending the Magic to a 10th consecutive defeat Friday night. Orlando (10-29) rallied to force overtime against visiting Chicago on Wednesday and had late leads in two of the three extra periods before suffering a 128-125 defeat. The Magic had a chance to take a lead in the final seconds of the third overtime, but Glen Davis' 3-point attempt was partially blocked. Coach Jacque Vaughn, though, was not displeased by his team's effort after Orlando had lost its previous six games by an average of 19.5 points. "You feel for the guys. You want them to get a victory underneath them, but we got better tonight," said Vaughn, whose team was coming off a five-game road trip. Rookie Victor Oladipo finished with a career-high 35 points, Jameer Nelson had a season-best 31 and Tobias Harris contributed 22 with 16 rebounds. "I'm more mad than exhausted right now," said Oladipo, who played a team-high 57 minutes. "But it's a short turnaround, so you have to have a short-term memory." While Orlando is likely to remain without starting center Nikola Vucevic (concussion) leading scorer Arron Afflalo could return after missing the last three games with a strained foot. "It's my intent to play, but I'm supposed to leave that up to the training staff," said Afflalo, averaging 20.8 points. The Magic look to avoid their third double-digit losing streak in 13 months by beating the Bobcats (16-24) for the second time in as many tries this season. Orlando won 92-83 in Charlotte on Dec. 11 with seven players scoring in double figures, led by Davis and Nelson with 17 points apiece. The Bobcats did win both of last season's visits to Orlando but enter this one having dropped seven of eight on the road. They lost for the ninth time in 11 games overall Wednesday, 95-92 in Philadelphia on Thaddeus Young's 3-pointer with 3.2 seconds to go. Al Jefferson and Kemba Walker delivered some more high-scoring performances but got little help from their teammates. Walker had a team-best 26 points and Jefferson scored 24, but no one else tallied more than 11. Over the last three games, Walker has averaged 26.7 points while Jefferson has scored 26.3. Walker averaged 28.8 points in last season's four meetings with Orlando but scored 10 on 4-of-18 shooting in last month's loss. Jefferson also was held to 10, and Gerald Henderson scored 12 on 3-of-14 shooting after averaging 25.0 points during Charlotte's three-game win streak in the series. Henderson had eight points - one off a season low - and shot a season-worst 2 for 14 on Wednesday. Harris, who missed last month's matchup with the Bobcats because of a sprained ankle, was one off a career high with 29 points in his last game against them - a 114-108 road loss March 27.
