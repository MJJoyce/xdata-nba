Pistons-76ers Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Dec 09 2012 8:43PM The Philadelphia 76ers' offense mostly has sputtered since the beginning of the month, leading to their worst stretch of the season. No single shooting performance has been worse than the last time they faced the Detroit Pistons, though. Philadelphia looks to snap out of its funk when it hosts Detroit on Monday night. The 76ers (11-9) entered this month on a three-game winning streak but have dropped three of their four December games after falling 92-79 at Boston on Saturday. They shot 39.2 percent after hitting only 37.4 percent from the floor the previous night in a 95-94 overtime win over the Celtics. Philadelphia, which ranks among the worst in the league with a 42.5 field-goal percentage, is shooting 23.3 percent from 3-point range over its last four. "I think all the shots that we took were all good shots," said Jrue Holiday, who finished 4 of 13 with 11 points Saturday and is shooting 36.4 percent over his last three games. "I know in the first quarter at least seven of them rattled in and out, where you thought they were good buckets. Times like that, what can you do?" Thaddeus Young hit 9 of 15 shots and scored a game-high 22 points, but Evan Turner finished 6 of 16 and scored 13. Coach Doug Collins said the 76ers need to do a better job of helping Holiday and Turner when opponents double-team their two biggest playmakers. "We've got to do a better job of helping Jrue and Evan when they get trapped. Our guys did not react. I talked to them, I showed them the tape," Collins said. "They've gotta react before the trap, not after, and we were reacting after it. We've gotta get up and get the ball out, because when you do you're playing 4-on-3, and so we've gotta do a better job of that." While Philadelphia has struggled to find its shooting touch, it hasn't been nearly as bad as when it suffered through a season-worst 29.8 percent from the floor in a 94-76 home loss Nov. 14 to Detroit - one of the Pistons' two road victories. Detroit (7-15) picked up its other with a 104-97 win Saturday at Cleveland behind a career-high 30 points from Brandon Knight, who hit 10 of his 20 shots and scored 23 in the second half. "It was just me taking more advantage of the shots I did have," Knight said. "I was more aggressive doing my job." The Pistons improved to 2-10 on the road one night after blowing a 17-point first-half lead in a 108-104 home loss to Chicago. Tayshaun Prince added 14 points for Detroit, which had dropped four of its previous five. "It was good to get a road win, but it's also good that we played (Saturday) because we had a couple of heartbreakers that we needed to get over," Prince said. Greg Monroe had 19 points and 18 rebounds while Knight added 15 points, seven boards and seven assists in Detroit's win at Philadelphia last month. Holiday finished 4 of 13 with 12 points and Young went only 2 for 11 from the field for the 76ers, who have lost the last two meetings by a combined 40 points.
