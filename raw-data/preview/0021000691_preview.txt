So far, that's exactly what he's done. The Bobcats go for their first four-game road winning streak in two seasons on Friday night when they try to post their third straight victory visiting the Golden State Warriors. With Larry Brown out as coach following the team's season-high fourth consecutive loss, Silas took over Dec. 22 for a club that had dropped three of its previous five games by 31 or more points and was 29th in the league in scoring at 91.8 per game. "I want to bring some energy to this ball club," Silas said in his return to the NBA sidelines following a five-year absence. "I want us to get up and down and let it all hang out." Silas' coaching philosophy and personality have caught on, as the Bobcats (19-25) have won 10 of 16 since his arrival. "We are a confident team right now, and we credit that to coach Silas," Stephen Jackson said after scoring a team-high 23 points in Wednesday's 114-107 win at Phoenix. "He gives us confidence and lets us play and it is starting to show." It's showing on both ends of the floor. Charlotte is averaging 95.8 points and yielding 94.5 per game - 3.1 fewer than under Brown - under Silas. The Bobcats continue their season-high six-game trip with a chance to win four in a row on the road for the first time since Feb. 25-March 7, 2009. This matchup at Oracle Arena should have considerably less emotion than last year's 121-110 victory by the Bobcats on Jan. 29.  Jackson was booed throughout that game in his return to Oakland following an early season trade to Charlotte. Jackson and Gerald Wallace scored 30 points apiece in the win. The Warriors (19-26) will try to avoid a third straight home loss in this series and a fourth straight defeat overall. Coming off Monday's 113-102 loss to NBA-best San Antonio that snapped its four-game winning streak at Oracle Arena, Golden State had one of its worst defensive performances of the season Wednesday, falling 112-103 to New Orleans. The Hornets hit 62.2 percent from the field for the game, making 14 of their first 17 shots and forcing seven Warriors turnovers while building a 34-21 first-quarter lead. "The NBA takes two things - effort and toughness," Golden State coach Keith Smart said. "And if you've got effort and you have toughness, you're going to have a chance to play against any team in the NBA. If you don't show any of that against the good teams, they're going to force their will. And we didn't force our will early in the game." That wasn't the case in a 96-95 victory at Charlotte on Dec. 31 when the Warriors made their first seven shots and led by 11 just 3:01 into the contest. Monta Ellis scored 25 points and Stephen Curry added 24 in that matchup as Golden State handed Charlotte its first loss under Silas following two victories. The Bobcats haven't been swept in a season series by the Warriors since their 2004-05 expansion year. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
