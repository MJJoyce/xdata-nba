Rockets-Mavericks Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 27 2011 2:02AM Following a disappointing road-heavy stretch, the Dallas Mavericks began a four-game homestand with their highest scoring output of the season. They could be in line for another offensive outpouring against the Houston Rockets. Dallas will try to record a third consecutive win for the first time this month when it hosts the defensively erratic Rockets on Thursday night. Four players scored at least 20 points as the Mavericks (29-15) overcame an eight-point halftime deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers 112-105 on Tuesday night. After going 2-5 in its previous seven games - six of which came on the road - Dallas was pleased with the home victory, but it's hoping to launch a stretch of success more like its 17-1 run from Nov. 20-Dec. 27. "This was a good start to a homestand," Jason Terry, who had a season-high 28 points, told the Mavericks' official website. "Obviously, we have ground to make up from what we lost when we had our key guys injured. And I think tonight was a good start." Dirk Nowitzki scored 20 points and is averaging 19.2 - 4.1 below his season mark - over six contests since returning from a sprained right knee that sidelined him for nine games. Since 2003-04, the nine-time All Star has averaged 26.1 points versus the Rockets at home - including a career-high 53-point performance during a 113-106 overtime win Dec. 2, 2004. Dallas, which went 2-7 without Nowitzki, has won 23 of its last 26 games against Houston when he scores at least 20 points. Mavericks center Tyson Chandler shot 5 of 5 from the floor and made all 11 of his free-throw attempts Tuesday en route to a season-best 21 points. Chandler, averaging 9.6 points, has totaled 40 in his last two games. The Mavericks are 8-1 when he scores 14 or more. Dallas had lost back-to-back home meetings with the Rockets (22-25) prior to taking three of the last four, including a 101-91 victory Nov. 29. "Houston, they always play us tough," Terry said. "A tough team, and I know they're gonna be another tough challenge." Houston, too, is coming off an impressive win over the Clippers, outscoring them 26-10 over the final 12 minutes Wednesday night for a 96-83 victory at home - its fifth win in seven games overall. While the Rockets held star rookie Blake Griffin to 5-of-16 shooting and Los Angeles to 36.4 percent, they've struggled defensively on the road, where they are allowing an average of 110.1 points over seven January games. Following this contest, Houston's four-game road trip continues against the Spurs, Lakers and Jazz, and while coach Rick Adelman acknowledges the tough task at hand, he remains confident in his team. "(These games) are going to be hard," he said. "You look at the teams and you say 'Oh jeez,' (but) I think if we play the way we're capable of playing, we can beat anybody - and that's the approach we have to take." Houston guard Kevin Martin had averaged 28.2 points in his previous five games before matching a season low with eight Wednesday as he failed to get to the free-throw line for the first time all season. Martin has averaged 15.3 points on 28.9 percent shooting in his last three visits to Dallas. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
