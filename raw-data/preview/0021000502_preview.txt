76ers-Hornets Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Jan 02 2011 4:44PM Finishing their longest road stretch of the season with a .500 record would be a major accomplishment for the Philadelphia 76ers. Based on their recent play against the Hornets, a visit to New Orleans might give them a good chance to achieve it. The 76ers try for a fourth consecutive win over the Hornets as they close out an eight-game trip Monday night. Philadelphia (13-20) is 5-14 away from home, but 3-4 on this road swing that has included victories over playoff contenders Orlando, Denver and Phoenix. "I told our guys they should be looking forward to the new year, because we have a lot of things to be thankful for," coach Doug Collins said. Though the 76ers fell 102-98 to the Los Angeles Lakers on New Year's Eve, they stayed close to the two-time defending champions before missing five shots in the final minute. "I was really proud of our guys," Collins said. "Our guys are really maturing from where we started to where we are now." One of those players is second-year point guard Jrue Holiday. After averaging 8.0 points last season, the former first-round pick is putting up 14.3 per game. He averaged 20.8 points the last five contests and had 19 and 11 assists against the Lakers. Holiday recorded 12 points, five rebounds and four assists during an 88-70 win over New Orleans on Dec. 12. The Hornets (20-14) were held to a season low in points in that contest, with the 76ers allowing their lowest output since a 112-69 win over Milwaukee on Jan. 30, 2008. "Give them credit," Hornets coach Monty Williams said after that game. "They're active and athletic." The Hornets have averaged 85.3 points during their three-game skid in the series. The 76ers, however, could be in for a tougher challenge Monday. New Orleans is 13-4 at home and will be trying to avoid losing consecutive games on its own floor for the first time this season. The Hornets fell 103-88 to the Lakers at New Orleans Arena last Monday. Chris Paul was the lone Hornets player to score in double figures against the 76ers last month with 25 points. New Orleans was much more balanced in a 92-81 victory over Washington on Saturday. Paul had 13 points and 11 assists, making him one of six Hornets with at least 10 points. Trevor Ariza scored 22 and Emeka Okafor added 17 points and 15 rebounds in New Orleans' second straight victory. Okafor has been held to a total of 10 points and 14 boards in the last two meetings with Philadelphia. However, he had 35 points and 28 boards in the Hornets' consecutive victories over Boston and the Wizards. The 76ers will be without Andre Iguodala, who's averaging 14.2 points, for a fourth straight game because of tendinitis in his Achilles' tendon. He is likely to miss one more week.
