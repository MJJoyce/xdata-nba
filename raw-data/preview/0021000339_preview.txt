Magic-Jazz Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Dec 10 2010 2:39AM The Utah Jazz averaged more than 33 home wins over the last four seasons. Meeting that average would be a major accomplishment for the Jazz in 2010-11 given how they've started at EnergySolutions Arena. Coming off a rare home loss to an Eastern Conference opponent, Northwest Division-leading Utah closes a six-game stretch in Salt Lake City on Friday night against the Orlando Magic, who could fall into third place in the Southeast if they don't end a season-high three-game losing streak. While Utah (16-7) has the league's best home record since the start of 2006-07 - 142-36 - the club is just 9-5 there this season compared to 32-9 in 2009-10. Wednesday's 111-98 loss to Miami was just Utah's second home setback in 25 games against East opponents since Jan. 24, 2009. "If you would have told me before the season that we would be a better road team (7-2) than a home team, I would have laughed at you," said Deron Williams, who finished with 21 points - four in the second half - and 12 assists. "Hopefully we get it going." Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, whose team plays seven of nine on the road to end 2010, hopes that improvement starts on the defensive end. After Utah held teams to 90.8 points and 41.6 percent shooting during a 9-2 stretch from Nov. 17-Dec. 6, the Heat shot 51.3 percent while outrebounding the Jazz 42-28. "I thought Miami was more physical than we were," Sloan said. Utah is among just a handful of teams averaging fewer than 40 rebounds. "We've always been a good rebounding team since I've been here," Williams said prior to Thursday's practice. "I don't know why (we're not now), but we've got to do a better job." Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap will face a tough test on the boards with Magic center Dwight Howard, who is among the league leaders with 12.3 rebounds per game. In his second game since missing two with a stomach virus, Howard had a season-high 39 points with 15 boards and three blocks in Thursday's 97-83 loss at Portland. A season-high six-game winning streak gave the Magic (15-7) a 2 1/2-game divisional lead on Dec. 3, but a fourth consecutive loss Friday - it would be the team's first such stretch since Jan. 2-8 - plus Miami and Atlanta victories, will drop Orlando into third. "We have to play the game better and we have to play it with a lot more energy, alertness and cohesiveness," said coach Stan Van Gundy, whose team is scoring 80.7 points per game on shooting 40.5 percent during its skid. Orlando, though, is getting healthy again after a stomach bug sidelined Howard, J.J. Redick, Mickael Pietrus and Jameer Nelson, who finished with 10 points and five rebounds on Thursday after being out the previous three games. Following a two-game absence with a sprained left ankle, Nelson had 19 points and seven assists as the Magic fell 104-94 to the Jazz on Nov. 10. Orlando led by as many as 18 in the third quarter but committed 21 turnovers and suffered its first loss at the new Amway Center. The Magic had a franchise-record eight-game road winning streak snapped in their last visit to Salt Lake City, a 120-111 loss exactly one year ago. Howard recorded his fifth straight double-double while visiting the Jazz with 18 points and 10 boards. The teams have alternated wins in the last nine matchups in Utah.
