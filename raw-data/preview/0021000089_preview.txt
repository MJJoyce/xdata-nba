Thanks to some hot shooting from his teammates and steadily improving defense, the Knicks are progressing anyway. New York looks to make it three straight wins for the first time since January as they host the struggling Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday. Stoudemire is shooting 41.5 percent and has averaged 5.4 turnovers through five games, but it turns out the Knicks (3-2) aren't relying solely on their $100 million free-agent acquisition. New York won its past two games thanks to some fantastic shooting. Toney Douglas scored a career-high 30 points in a 120-112 victory at Chicago on Thursday as the Knicks hit 16 of 24 from behind the arc. The guard then had 19 points, 10 rebounds and five steals as New York again stayed hot from 3-point range (12 of 29) in a 112-91 win over Washington on Friday. "We're creating our own identity, making sure of our own destiny," said Douglas, who has scored in double figures in all five games off the bench. "We know what it takes to win and everyone's on the same page." Raymond Felton (43.5 percent) and Danilo Gallinari (41.7) have also shot well from beyond the arc, but more surprising is some defensive disruption the Knicks rarely displayed in D'Antoni's first two seasons. New York leads the league with 8.4 blocks per game - Stoudemire had four Friday - and has averaged 9.8 steals in its past four contests. The Knicks forced 45 turnovers against Chicago and Washington, and they've yielded 100.2 points per game thus far - 13.8 fewer than what they were allowing through five games last season. "We're playing well, we really are," Stoudemire said. "We're doing a great job defensively. That's the most important factor for us right now, is to really key in defensively. Our offense is going to work itself out. Guys are slowly getting into their rhythm out there." New York hasn't won three straight since a three-game run from Jan. 1-7, but it certainly seems capable of matching that streak against the 76ers (1-5). After starting 0-4, Philadelphia routed Indiana 101-75 on Wednesday by holding the Pacers to 31.5 percent shooting. That impressive defensive showing, however, didn't carry over to Friday. Visiting Cleveland shot 54.7 percent, got to the free-throw line 48 times and scored 44 points in the fourth quarter of a 123-116 comeback win. Point guard Jrue Holiday had a career-high 29 points for Philadelphia, which is in danger of being 1-6 for the first time since 1994-95. "The hardest thing to teach a team is how to win," first-year coach Doug Collins said. "Not how to get close, but how to win, and that is what we are going to keep striving to do." The Sixers have lost three in a row to the Knicks after taking the previous six meetings, and they'll be without Andre Iguodala at Madison Square Garden. The team's leading scorer in each of the past four seasons, Iguodala left the game against the Cavaliers with an injured right  Achilles' tendon. Iguodala has started 252 consecutive games.
