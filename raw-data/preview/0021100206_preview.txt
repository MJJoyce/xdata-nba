Warriors-Nets Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Jan 18 2012 1:03AM In their last season in New Jersey before moving to Brooklyn for 2012-13, the Nets haven't given the home fans much to cheer about. The Nets will look to snap a six-game home losing streak dating back to last season Wednesday night when they host the Golden State Warriors, who are trying to win three in a row on the road for the first time in more than four years. New Jersey is 0-4 at home this season, where it is averaged 88.8 points and giving up 105.3. The Nets (3-11) return home following a 1-3 road trip which ended with losses to Utah and the Los Angeles Clippers. New Jersey rallied back from 18 down against the Clippers on Monday, but went on to lose 101-91 for its fifth defeat in six games overall. MarShon Brooks scored a team-high 19 points while Deron Williams finished with 14, but the Nets couldn't overcome another slow start as they were outscored 32-17 in the first quarter. New Jersey is averaging an NBA-worst 19.2 points while shooting 35.6 percent in the opening period this season. "We dug ourselves such a big hole (Monday)," coach Avery Johnson said. "Then we finally got our offense together and played hard-nosed defense and were able to minimize our errors. I liked the way our guys battled." While Williams, who has shot 8 of 29 from the floor over the last two games, is struggling, Brooks is having a solid rookie season. The Providence College product is averaging 14.6 points - including 17.3 at home - and has scored in double figures in eight straight games. The Warriors (5-8) might not usually be the strongest of opponents, but they've won their last two as they enter the finale of a four-game road trip after beating Cleveland 105-95 on Tuesday. David Lee scored a season-high 29 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter, and Nate Robinson added 17 off the bench. The Warriors reserves outscored their Cavaliers counterparts 50-31. Golden State hasn't won three straight on the road since Dec. 23-31, 2007. The Warriors went 10-31 on the road last season and had lost their first four away from home in 2011-12. A big reason for the recent good turnaround is Lee, who has scored at least 20 points in five straight games while shooting 64.3 percent, including a 13-for-20 effort from the field Tuesday. "It was David Lee's night," said Monta Ellis, who suffered a cut and swollen nose. "We needed someone to step up. He can do that every night." New Jersey has had a tough time slowing Lee down in the past. He's averaging 22.4 points and 10.0 rebounds in his last five games against the Nets. The Warriors need Lee to step up again as they remain without Stephen Curry (sprained right ankle), who missed his seventh straight game Tuesday. The Nets snapped a six-game losing streak against the Warriors with a 94-90 home victory last March. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
