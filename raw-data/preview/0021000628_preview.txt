Clippers-Trail Blazers Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 20 2011 3:11AM The Los Angeles Clippers continue to roll, but a season-best fourth consecutive win could be hard to come by against the Portland Trail Blazers. After matching their longest winning streak of the season, the Clippers will try to avoid a fifth straight loss to the Blazers when they visit the Rose Garden on Thursday night. Los Angeles (16-25) recorded its highest scoring output in almost two years while defeating Minnesota 126-111 on Wednesday night for its 11th win in 15 games, even as Blake Griffin's franchise-record double-double streak came to an end at 27 games. Griffin recorded 29 points and eight rebounds following an NBA-season-high 47-point effort in Monday's 114-107 win over Indiana. The rookie averaged 25.4 points and 13.8 rebounds during his run of double-doubles, and he is starting to enjoy his team's recent success. "You hear how much looser everyone is, how much fun it is," Griffin said. Eric Gordon scored 23 points versus the Timberwolves and is averaging 26.1 points while making 20 of 42 from 3-point range in his last seven games - helping the Clippers go 6-1. Gordon left briefly in the first quarter Wednesday after injuring the tendon in his right ring finger, but he returned and should be available Thursday. "It's hurting pretty bad. I'm just going to play through it," he said. "They said it's probably torn." While the Clippers have played much better of late, they haven't had much success against the Blazers, averaging just 87.8 points during a four-game skid that includes two losses earlier this season. Los Angeles fell 100-91 on Dec. 5 in Portland, where it has lost its last four by an average of 16.0 points. The Clippers last recorded four straight wins Dec. 31, 2009-Jan. 10, 2010, including a 105-95 home victory over the Blazers - their last against the franchise. Portland (23-20) has a chance to match its season-best four-game winning streak after defeating Sacramento 94-90 in overtime Wednesday night thanks to another impressive effort from LaMarcus Aldridge. Aldridge continued his hot play by scoring 10 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter and five of his team's nine in the extra period. He is averaging 27.0 points and 10.2 rebounds in January. Aldridge, though, was held to a season-low four points on 2-of-10 shooting from the floor last month against the Clippers after scoring at least 22 in four of the previous five home meetings. The Blazers, already without three-time All-Star Brandon Roy - who had arthroscopic surgery on both of his knees earlier in the week - played Wednesday without former Clipper Marcus Camby for the first time since learning that their starting center will miss a significant amount of time due to a partially torn meniscus in his left knee. "Collectively, we've got to do those things that our guys missing were doing for us," Blazers coach Nate McMillan said. "(Wednesday) it was mentally challenging in an overtime game on the road. In overtime we made plays, something we talked about doing all season long. You need to make plays down the stretch." Four nights after a season-best 23-point effort in a win over New Jersey, Nicolas Batum registered 24 against the Kings as he bounced back from a 1-of-11 shooting performance Monday during a 113-102 victory over Minnesota. Portland is averaging 100.6 points while going 10-2 in its last 12 home games. The Clippers, meanwhile, are 0-12 as the visiting team when allowing at least 100 points.
