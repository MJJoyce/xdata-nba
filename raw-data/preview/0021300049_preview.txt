Celtics-Grizzlies Preview By KEVIN CHROUST Posted Nov 04 2013 12:44AM It's taking the Boston Celtics longer than they'd hoped to earn first-year coach Brad Stevens his first NBA win. Getting it Monday night against the Memphis Grizzlies would also avoid the franchise's first 0-4 start since 1969. The Celtics (0-3) fell 87-77 Sunday at Detroit after momentarily overcoming a 15-point second-half deficit. They grabbed a two-point lead with a 13-0 run, but the Pistons responded with 10 straight points for a lead they wouldn't relinquish. "We just have to get better," Celtics rookie Kelly Olynyk told the team's official website. "They capitalized on their chances. They're big and strong. Those bigs they have are really, really good. We cut it close a couple of times, but that's not good enough when you play in this league. We're getting better and hopefully we can string together a couple of wins." Olynyk led the Celtics with 15 points and eight rebounds off the bench while Avery Bradley and Jordan Crawford scored 13 apiece. "I thought we saw a lot of good things out of Kelly O," Stevens said. "We saw a lot of good things out of Avery Bradley tonight even though he turned it over some. I thought he played really hard and kind of got back to who he really is." They're certainly missing point guard Rajon Rondo, who continues to recover from a torn right ACL. A 24-turnover night upped their league-worst average to 21.0 per game. Poor 3-point shooting has also contributed to the slow start. Boston was 3 of 16 from long range against the Pistons and is shooting 22.2 percent this season. They've also been outrebounded 51-33 on the offensive glass. The Grizzlies (1-2) are coming off Saturday's 111-99 loss at Dallas. They trailed by 21 in the first half but stayed close with a 17-2 run before the break. "We fought back into the game," Marc Gasol said. "We just didn't convert enough baskets to get to a tie game or ahead." Mike Conley scored 24, Gasol had 23 and Zach Randolph added 21 as the trio combined for 68 of the team's 99 points. Conley is averaging 20.0 points through three games after turning in a career-high 14.6 in 2012-13. He's averaging 11.7 in 11 career games against the Celtics. The Grizzlies also struggled from 3-point range, going 3 of 16. They sent the Mavericks to the line 46 times and turned the ball over 18 times after committing 20 turnovers Friday against Detroit. "The turnovers - 18 - that's like 4 too many," Grizzlies coach David Joerger said.  "Because you're down 10 (points), OK, you got to 7 and then you make a mistake and it bounces back to 11 or 12." The Grizzlies won both meetings against the Celtics last season. Jerryd Bayless led seven players in double figures with 30 points in a 110-106 victory March 23, ending a five-game home losing streak in the series. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
