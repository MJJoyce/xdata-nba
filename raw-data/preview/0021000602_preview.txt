A visit from the Milwaukee Bucks, the NBA's lowest-scoring team, could help end that slide. The Rockets look to win their 11th straight home meeting with the Bucks on Monday as they try to win back-to-back games for the first time in three weeks. Houston (18-23) won for only the second time in nine games Saturday, defeating Atlanta 112-106. The Rockets had dropped their previous two by a combined 11 points, including a 110-105 overtime loss to New Orleans on Friday. "We have, in the last two years, been very resilient," coach Rick Adelman said. "That's what I told them after the game. It just shows that we have to stay with it because we have the potential to keep winning games." Aaron Brooks matched a season high 24 points and added 10 assists Saturday while Jordan Hill set a career high with 16 points on 8-of-12 shooting, helping the Rockets shoot 54.0 percent. Hill has come off the bench the last two games after struggling in the previous eight as a starter. With Brad Miller (sore left knee) out for a fourth straight game and rookie Patrick Patterson sent to the hospital for chest pains and congestion, Hill added eight rebounds in arguably his best performance of the season. "That's what we need of him," Adelman said. "He rebounded tonight. He made shots around the basket. It just makes all the world of a difference when we get that production." Patterson returned with the team to Houston on Saturday after tests revealed no problems other than flulike symptoms. Houston hasn't won back-to-back games since a five-game winning streak Dec. 17-27, with the team's struggles at home a big reason for its inconsistency. The Rockets have dropped their last four at the Toyota Center - two in overtime - and will be looking to avoid losing five straight at home for the first time since March 13-26, 2006. Houston suffered a 97-91 loss at Milwaukee on Dec. 10, but has won its last 10 at home over the Bucks by an average of 12.3 points. While the Rockets have given up at least 100 points in each of their last 11 games, they may have an easier time slowing Milwaukee, the NBA's lowest-scoring team at 91.2 points per game. The Bucks haven't reached the century mark in Houston since a 115-110 loss Dec. 22, 2001. The Bucks (14-23) have lost their last two and five of six, including a 95-94 defeat at Philadelphia on Friday in which they allowed the 76ers to shoot 57.1 percent - the highest by an opponent this season. Milwaukee rallied from a 15-point deficit and took the lead midway through the fourth quarter, but Philadelphia hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 43 seconds left and the Bucks failed to score on two more possessions. Corey Maggette scored a team-high 16 points and Andrew Bogut had 10 points, 12 rebounds and three blocked shots. "We played pretty good offensively, but couldn't get anything going defensively," coach Scott Skiles said. Bogut, who has averaged 17.7 rebounds in his last three games, had 22 rebounds and 24 points in the win over the Rockets last month. Milwaukee is looking to sweep the season series for the first time since 1999-2000, the same season it last won in Houston. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
