With the way LaMarcus Aldridge has played lately, that trend could continue. The Trail Blazers seek a 15th consecutive win over the Timberwolves on Monday night at the Rose Garden. Despite trailing by as many as 13 points to one of the NBA's worst teams in the first half Saturday night, Portland (21-20) clamped down on defense and held New Jersey to 13 fourth-quarter points in a 96-89 win to end a three-game skid. "That's how we have to play," Nicolas Batum said after scoring a season-high 23 points. "You're right, we miss B-Roy (Brandon Roy). He was the closer for us at the end of the game. Now we know we have five guys on the court, so we can use the five guys on the court." While Roy - a three-time All Star - has missed the last 15 games with injuries to both his knees, Portland - which sits eighth in the Western Conference  - continues to persevere. "It was big for everybody's confidence," point guard Andre Miller said. "No matter what team it is." Aldridge came through with another impressive effort, scoring 14 of his team-high 27 points over the final 24 minutes. Aldridge is averaging 25.8 points on 53.2 percent shooting and 10.2 rebounds over his last 16 games - including a career high-tying 36-point performance in a 107-102 win over Minnesota on Dec. 17. Wesley Matthews, too, has played a bigger role offensively with Roy on the sidelines, also setting a career-best mark versus the Timberwolves with 36 points on Jan. 7. Matthews is averaging 28.5 points while making 9 of 18 3s against them this season. The Blazers, who have won nine of 11 at home while allowing 92.7 points per game, have defeated the Timberwolves (10-31) by an average of 12.8 points during their 14-game run while scoring 109.0 points in the last six meetings. Portland hasn't lost in this series since March 25, 2007. Minnesota has gone a Western Conference-worst 2-19 on the road and fell for the sixth time in seven games overall with a 108-99 loss to Orlando on Saturday night. Playing without Michael Beasley - second on the team with 20.9 points per game - for the second straight contest, the Timberwolves received a solid effort from Corey Brewer. "This is the best I've felt all year," said Brewer, who scored a season-high 23 points. "I felt like I was starting to get better, the ball was starting to feel a lot better coming out of my hands. Tonight it started going in - so it's a good sign." Brewer missed practice Sunday but should be available while Beasley's status is unknown as he continues to deal with a sprained left ankle. Kevin Love had a quiet night for his standards, recording 11 points and 15 rebounds for his NBA-best 36th double-double. Love had averaged 27.6 points and 16.4 points in his previous five games, including a 30-point, 19-rebound effort during this month's 108-98 loss to Portland. The Timberwolves' 110.2 points allowed on the road rank 29th in the league, but they've limited opponents to 95.7 in their last three games as the visiting team.
