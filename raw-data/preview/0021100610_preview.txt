Warriors-Clippers Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Mar 11 2012 3:30AM Chris Paul and the Los Angeles Clippers are coming off their most prolific offensive display of the season, but consistency remains elusive. Opening a six-game homestand against the Golden State Warriors would appear to give them with a chance to start stringing victories together. Paul and the Clippers look to win back-to-back games for the first time in nearly a month Sunday night when they attempt to continue their home success versus the Warriors. Paul was outstanding Friday, making 12 of 20 shots to match his season high of 36 points while adding 11 assists in the Clippers' 120-108 victory at San Antonio to salvage a 3-3 road trip. Los Angeles (23-15) shot 51.2 percent from the field overall and made 14 of 27 3-point attempts en route to their highest scoring output of the season. "At least to go back home knowing that we split, won three out of the six, was a good win for us," said Paul, averaging 25.6 points and 8.1 assists over his last eight games. Despite Paul's efforts, the Clippers are 4-6 since last posting back-to-back victories Feb. 15 and 16. That stretch includes a 104-97 loss at Golden State (16-21) on Feb. 20. They've also dropped three of their last five games at Staples Center after winning 10 of their first 12 at home. However, Los Angeles has won 11 of its last 14 home meetings with Golden State, averaging 107.4 points in those contests. The Clippers extended their home winning streak in the series to three Jan. 22, 2011, when Blake Griffin came two assists shy of a triple-double, getting 30 points and pulling down 18 rebounds in a 113-109 victory. Paul is averaging 25.6 points and 9.6 assists in his last 10 meetings with the Warriors, including a career high-tying 43 points in a loss with New Orleans on April 3, 2009. He's totaled 44 points and 15 assists in two matchups - one win and one loss - this season at Golden State. Paul wouldn't mind another strong effort from backcourt partner Mo Williams, who scored a season-high 33 points Friday while shooting 12 for 19. He had 22 points against Golden State in last month's loss. The Warriors enter this meeting after Saturday's 111-87 rout of defending champion Dallas. David Lee led the way with 25 points and nine rebounds, scoring 13 in the first quarter as Golden State built an 11-point edge. Lee was also a big reason the Warriors won the last meeting with the Clippers, finishing with 24 points, 13 rebounds and three steals. Stephen Curry had 11 points in that matchup, but is averaging 21.8 points in four career road meetings with the Clippers, including a game-high 32 in the Warriors' last visit. Curry's status for this contest is unclear, though, after he re-aggravated a tendon sprain in his right foot during Saturday's win. Visibly frustrated, he slammed his right hand into a chair upon exiting. "I just had a reaction because it's frustrating being the same ankle," said Curry, who hadn't started any of the previous six games due to the injury. "I probably could have gone in and played but we had the game under control at that point, and knowing we have a game (Sunday) in L.A., I had to keep that in mind."
