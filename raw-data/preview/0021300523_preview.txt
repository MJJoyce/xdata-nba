Warriors-Nets Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Jan 08 2014 2:01AM With David Lee playing at an All-Star level and Stephen Curry providing some memorable moments, the Golden State Warriors are on the cusp of matching the franchise's longest winning streak. The Brooklyn Nets are going for their longest run of the season, though they'll have to do it without Deron Williams. The Warriors look to make it 11 in a row while the Nets try to remain unbeaten in 2014 Wednesday night in Brooklyn. Lee finished with 22 points and 18 rebounds while shooting 10 for 12 as Golden State (24-13) improved to 6-0 on its season-high seven-game trip with Tuesday's 101-80 rout of Milwaukee. Now the Warriors have a chance to equal the franchise-record 11-game streak set Dec. 29, 1971-Jan. 22, 1972. They've had two other 10-game streaks, most recently Dec. 6-23, 1975. "It's this close so we're going to chase history," coach Mark Jackson said. "My guys have paid the price and I'm incredibly proud of them." Lee has been on a roll throughout much of this run, averaging 23.0 points on 63.6 percent shooting while hitting at least half his shots in nine consecutive contests. The red-hot forward also has scored 25.7 per game while hitting 36 of 53 (67.9 percent) from the field in his last three meetings with the Nets (13-21). He finished with 30 points and 15 rebounds to lead Golden State to a 109-102 win in Brooklyn on Dec. 7, 2012. Curry added 28 points with five 3-pointers in that contest, and scored 25 in a 102-93 home win over the Nets on Nov. 21, 2012. The star guard is shooting just 38.1 percent during the win streak after going 10 for 35 in his last two games. But he recorded his third career triple-double in a win over Phoenix on Dec. 27 and had 36 points, 12 assists and eight 3s in Thursday's win at Miami. The resilient Nets will be without one of their key playmakers as they try for their season-best fourth straight victory. Williams has been ruled out for the 13th time this season after missing Monday's 91-86 win over visiting Atlanta because of a sprained left ankle and will be re-evaluated at the end of the week. Williams had a season-high 29 points in Thursday's thrilling 95-93 win at Oklahoma City before scoring 21 on 7-of-10 shooting in an 89-82 victory over Cleveland on Saturday. Joe Johnson averaged 7.0 points while shooting 30.0 percent over a five-game stretch before ending his slump with 23 points and the go-ahead 3-pointer with 6:21 remaining in Monday's win. The veteran shooting guard finished with 32 points in last season's home loss to Golden State. Although the Warriors have averaged 107.4 points in their last seven games, they could be challenged against a Brooklyn team that has had a renewed focus on the defensive end. The Nets have allowed 87.0 points per game and a 41.5 field-goal percentage during their unbeaten start to 2014, far lower than their season marks of 101.1 and 45.5. "As long as we just keep that rolling, man, we know we've got a couple of tough games ahead of us, but like I said, take it one game at a time, one practice at a time, and keep building," swingman Alan Anderson said. Brooklyn, though, is 0-16 when it allows more than 100 points and Golden State has reached that mark in 12 of its last 14 games. The Warriors have won nine of 10 against Eastern Conference opponents.
