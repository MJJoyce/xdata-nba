Trail Blazers-Nuggets Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 02 2011 2:52AM After losing on the last two stops of their season-high five-game road trip, the Denver Nuggets are surely looking forward to returning home. The recent play of LaMarcus Aldridge, however, may be tempering some of their excitement. Hoping to avoid tying a season-high losing streak, the Nuggets will try to slow Aldridge down Wednesday night as they seek their 15th win in 16 home games against the Portland Trail Blazers. Denver (28-20) averaged 115.3 points in racing out to a promising 3-0 start on its trip against Eastern Conference opponents, but fell 110-99 at Philadelphia on Sunday before losing 115-99 at New Jersey one night later. Those defeats dropped the Nuggets to 2-13 when scoring less than 100 points. Carmelo Anthony, who was rumored to be on his way to New Jersey until Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov recently squashed the deal, had 37 points on 12-of-22 shooting. "He's our foundation, he's our horse and we're having a damn good year, so he should be given a lot of credit for that," coach George Karl said. While Anthony's name will surely continue to pop up in rumors as the Feb. 24 trade deadline approaches, he won't be the only star on the Pepsi Center court Wednesday night. While the Blazers (26-22) haven't experienced much success in Denver, they do enter Colorado on a high note. Portland closed out a five-game homestand with an impressive 99-86 win over San Antonio on Tuesday night thanks to a career-high 40 points and 11 rebounds from Aldridge. "Tonight it just felt good," he said. Aldridge, averaging a team-best 21.4 points, scored just 26 total on 35.3 percent shooting while dealing with a hip injury in his previous two games - both Blazers' losses. But he seemed to benefit from a four-day break in going 16 of 23 from the field against the Spurs, the only team in the league to reach 40 wins this season. "Real good win for this team to beat the best team in the league," coach Nate McMillan said. "Those days off I thought really seemed like they helped our guys." Andre Miller, who spent three-plus seasons with Denver, added 18 points and nine assists in the win. He had averaged 20.2 points in five road games against his former team since he was traded away in 2006, before being bottled up for just nine in their last meeting. Miller, of course, played under Karl and with Anthony during his stint with the Nuggets, and his former coach remains hopeful that Anthony will be a part of the Nuggets-Blazers series for years to come. "I've always felt from the very beginning of the season that the chance of that happening was greater than all you all thought," said Karl. "I just felt that way from the first day of training camp, from September, I've always felt that way." Anthony, who leads the team with 23.9 points per game, is averaging 28.8 versus Portland at home during his career. If history is any indication, he should again play a critical role as Denver is 17-3 against the Blazers overall and 11-0 at home when he scores at least 20 points. The Nuggets have taken the last five against the Blazers at the Pepsi Center by an average of 14.2 points. Denver, which leads the NBA in scoring with 107.5 points per game, put forth their best defensive effort of the season in a 95-77 win Dec. 28 with Anthony on the sidelines. The Blazers have taken six of eight while holding opponents to an average of  92.0 points. They are just 2-10 when allowing over 100 points. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
