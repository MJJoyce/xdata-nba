The Warriors strive for a better offensive effort at the United Center while trying for a third straight victory Thursday night against the Bulls. Golden State has averaged 108.7 points per game since the start of the 2006-07 season, but also has shot 38.0 percent and averaged 91.9 points while losing eight of nine in Chicago. The Warriors have been held to fewer than 90 points in five of seven trips to the United Center. One of the NBA's worst defensive teams allowing an average of 110.0 points since 2006-07, the Warriors have yielded 107.5 per contest while losing three of four on the road to the Bulls. The Warriors hope all that changes while trying to start 7-2 for the first time since 1994-95. Golden State has not made the playoffs since 2006-07. After opening its five-game trip with a 102-97 loss at Detroit on Sunday, Golden State has posted consecutive wins over Toronto and New York. Ex-Knick David Lee had 28 points and 10 rebounds in a 122-117 win over his former team Wednesday. "It was a great feeling," said Lee, averaging 14.3 points and 11.3 rebounds in his first season with the Warriors. "It would have been all for nothing if we wouldn't have won the game." Lee has averaged 21.7 points and 15.0 boards in his last three games versus the Bulls. Stephen Curry had 25 points with eight assists and Monta Ellis added 22 on Wednesday after injuring his back two nights earlier during a fourth-quarter fall at Toronto. Curry, who has totaled 59 points in the last two games, was held to six in 27 minutes of a 96-91 overtime loss at Chicago on Dec. 11. "Right now, he is in a growth cycle and he will continue to develop," coach Keith Smart told the Warriors' official website. Among the NBA's top scorers, Ellis is averaging 27.1 points this season and 27.8 in his last four against the Bulls. Chicago (3-3) looks for a second straight solid defensive effort after beating Denver 94-92 on Monday to improve to 3-1 at the United Center. The Bulls have held three of their four home opponents to fewer than 100 points. Derrick Rose had 18 points while Joakim Noah added 13 with 19 rebounds. Noah (15.7 ppg, 15.0 rpg) has double-doubles in all six games, the first Bull to do that since Artis Gilmore in the first 11 games of the 1978-79 season. Noah has totaled 32 points, 31 rebounds and seven blocks in his last two home games versus Golden State. "(Noah) blocks shots and holds the paint down," Nuggets star Carmelo Anthony said. "(He is an) energy guy." With top overall pick John Wall and Washington coming to town Saturday, the Bulls hope to string together two more wins and gain some momentum before the annual "Circus Trip" that starts Tuesday in Houston and goes continues for seven games until Nov. 27. "It's always been a bad trip," Luol Deng told the Bulls' official website. "So we've got to take care of home court and get these next two." Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
