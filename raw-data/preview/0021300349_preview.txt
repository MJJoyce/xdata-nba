Spurs-Jazz Preview By JORDAN GARRETSON Posted Dec 14 2013 1:59AM The San Antonio Spurs' veteran prowess was enough to overcome one of the NBA's best individual performances this season. Their experience - and their stingy defense - figure to be enough to hold off a suddenly improved Utah Jazz team in Salt Lake City on Saturday night. San Antonio (18-4) claimed a 117-110 home win over Minnesota on Friday despite Kevin Love's 42 points - three shy of the NBA high in 2013-14 - behind the strength of its seasoned core. Tony Parker scored 29 points, while 16 of Manu Ginobili's 20 points came in the fourth quarter, during which the Spurs outscored the Timberwolves 37-21. Ginobili is shooting 54.1 percent over his last nine games, including 47.7 percent from 3-point range. Tim Duncan finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds for his second-consecutive double-double and third in the last five games. "It's got to show up somewhere," Duncan said of the trio's experience. His 8.6 rebounds per game are the fewest of his career, though he's averaging 11.1 over his last eight contests. "If you want to call it that, it is what it is. We know what's going on out there, especially when it gets down to crunch time and things really count. We've made plays long enough that we know where each other is going to be." The Spurs needed a late comeback in a 91-82 win at Utah on Nov. 15, their 13th victory in 15 meetings and seventh straight. Parker scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter when they outscored the Jazz 31-15. San Antonio finished with a season-high 22 fast-break points - which it matched Friday. The Jazz (6-19) still own the league's worst record but look better of late, splitting their last 10 with a 103-93 victory at Denver on Friday. They appear to be dramatically improved offensively with rookie Trey Burke in the mix after he missed the first 12 games with a broken finger suffered in the preseason. Utah is averaging 98.5 points with 21.9 assists in 13 games with him after averaging 88.6 and 17.7 without him. Burke is 14 of 34 (41.2 percent) from long range over the last eight games while the team is shooting 44.9 percent from beyond the arc during that stretch. "We have all of our guys," coach Tyrone Corbin said. "We have different options." Burke had 10 points and 10 assists Friday while Gordon Hayward scored a season-high 30 to go along with a career-best 13 rebounds. Derrick Favors scored 20 points and grabbed a career-high 18 rebounds in the first meeting with San Antonio but Hayward was 5 of 23 from the field as Utah shot 38.5 percent with Burke still sidelined. Hayward is averaging 10.3 points while shooting 36.3 percent in 10 career games against the Spurs, who are likely to test Utah's improved offense. San Antonio ranks among the league leaders, limiting teams to 43.0 percent shooting and 93.6 points per game. However, the Spurs have been a little more vulnerable lately, allowing 102.2 points over the last six contests. Tiago Splitter's absence certainly doesn't appear to be helping as he missed his third straight game Friday due to left calf tightness. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
