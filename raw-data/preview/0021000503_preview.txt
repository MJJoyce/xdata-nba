Rockets-Nuggets Preview By BRETT HUSTON Posted Jan 03 2011 1:30AM Carmelo Anthony was rusty in his return to the lineup after a five-game absence. His teammates kept the Denver Nuggets rolling. A resurgent Chauncey Billups has led the Nuggets to three consecutive wins by at least 15 points, a streak they'll look to extend Monday night against the visiting Houston Rockets. Denver (19-13) lost the first three games Anthony missed following his sister's death, but Billups helped make sure that slide wouldn't continue. The veteran point guard had 18 points and nine assists in a 95-77 win over Portland on Tuesday, and he wasn't done carrying the Nuggets. Billups had a season-high 36 points in a 119-113 victory at Minnesota the following night, then led the way once more upon Anthony's return. Denver's superstar small forward missed 16 of 22 shots Saturday against Sacramento, but Billups scored a game-high 22 points in a 104-86 win. Billups has averaged 25.0 points and shot 58.9 percent in six games since returning from a sprained right wrist that sidelined him for 10 days. In his first 21 games, Billups averaged 14.4 points and shot 35.1 percent "I'm just feeling a lot better. I'm a lot healthier now," Billups told the Nuggets' official website. "I can be healthy and still shoot bad for a couple weeks. I've done that plenty of times. That's how the season goes. It's a long season. I just believe in the law of averages." Denver hasn't won four straight games by at least 15 points since Nov. 12-20, 2007. To match that streak Monday will likely require a better effort from Anthony, who is a 41.0 percent career shooter versus Houston (16-17) - his lowest mark against any Western Conference opponent. Anthony hopes he got any rust out of his system Saturday. "As far as what's going on in my head, I tried to clear it out when I stepped on that court," he said. "I was good. I just couldn't buy a shot (Saturday), and I couldn't find a rhythm. My legs weren't there. I'm glad I got this one out of my system. I'm all right. I'm good." The Nuggets hope Al Harrington is able to say the same Monday night. The reserve forward has missed the past three games with a dislocated right thumb, but coach George Karl thinks he could return to face the Rockets. Houston certainly wouldn't mind seeing him sit one more game. Harrington had 28 points and 10 rebounds in a 107-94 win at the Toyota Center on Oct. 30, when Billups missed seven of eight field-goal attempts. The Rockets have won six of eight, but struggled with their shooting in both defeats. After shooting 41.9 percent Wednesday in a loss to Miami, Houston hit just 41.3 percent while falling 100-85 Sunday at Portland. "Just a poor effort," coach Rick Adelman said. "That is as bad as we have played all year. We were a step behind all night." The Rockets are 9-1 when shooting 48 percent or better and 7-16 when held under that mark. Poor shooting aside, the loss to the 18-16 Trail Blazers wasn't particularly surprising. Though Houston is 10-5 since Dec. 3, none of those wins came against a team with a winning record. Guard Kevin Martin has averaged 25.7 points while shooting 48.7 percent in those 10 victories. He's scored 19.0 points per game and shot 42.9 percent in the Rockets' five losses over the past month.
