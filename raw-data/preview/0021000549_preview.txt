Heat-Trail Blazers Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Jan 08 2011 6:56PM No matter how difficult the situation, the Miami Heat continue to rise to the challenge. A trip to Portland could present another tough task to complete. The Heat look to extend their road winning streak to 13 games with a ninth consecutive victory overall Sunday night against the Trail Blazers, who are trying for a ninth straight win at home. Miami (29-9) needed overtime to win 101-95 at Milwaukee on Friday in the opener of a five-game trip. The Heat have won 20 of 21 overall and are two shy of matching the franchise record of 14 straight road victories, set from Nov. 19-Dec. 29, 1996. As they move closer to the 1971-72 Lakers' record of 16 consecutive road wins, the Heat continue to gain confidence while knowing they can win no matter what they must overcome. "It takes luck sometimes. Games that you maybe shouldn't have won," said LeBron James, who scored 18 of his 26 points in the first half Friday. "You have streaks like that, you definitely need some type of luck." Friday's victory could fall under that category. Miami won despite shooting 39.3 percent - its worst performance since November - and being limited to 36 second-half points. "I like these type of games," coach Erik Spoelstra said. "This is where you grow. I know we'll learn from some of these situations going down the stretch." James shot 8 of 23 from the field and Dwyane Wade went 4 of 19 for 14 points, his fewest in 23 games. Chris Bosh scored 10 of his 16 after the third quarter and added 12 rebounds. "It's not always going to be a bed of roses for us three and for our team," James said. Though the Heat hope to not find themselves in the same position Sunday, they could face a serious challenge against the Trail Blazers (20-17). Opponents have averaged 89.8 points on 40.1 percent shooting during Miami's road streak, but Miami has allowed 103.7 per game while losing five of six to Portland. The Heat, however, didn't have James and Bosh for those contests. James has averaged 31.8 points and 10.2 rebounds in his last six games at the Rose Garden. Bosh has recorded 24.3 points per contest in his last four at Portland. Coming off consecutive wins at Houston and Minnesota to conclude a three-game trip, Portland returns to the Rose Garden riding its longest home winning streak since taking 12 in a row Jan. 24-March 9, 2009. Second-year swingman Wesley Matthews has averaged 21.3 points during the eight-game home winning streak. He scored 29 of his career-high 36 points in the first half of a 108-98 win over Minnesota on Friday. Matthews is averaging 18.2 points in 11 games since Brandon Roy went down with a knee injury, and Portland has gone 8-3. "Every single one of us in this league is blessed to be living out our dreams and playing the game we love," Matthews said. "I'm just appreciative of every day. Keep working. Stay humble." LaMarcus Aldridge had 28 points with 10 rebounds Friday. He's averaged 27.0 points over the last four games but 13.6 in seven career contests versus Miami. Portland is 4-0 at home against Eastern Conference teams this season while Miami has won eight of nine against the West. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
