Bobcats-Hawks Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 12 2011 1:01AM After suffering one of the worst losses in franchise history last month, the Atlanta Hawks responded with a convincing win over the Charlotte Bobcats. Following another embarrassing defeat, the Hawks will look to bounce back against the Bobcats again as they try for an eighth consecutive home victory in the series Saturday night. Playing without All-Star center Al Horford for the second consecutive game, Atlanta (33-19) suffered its second-biggest defeat of the season with a 117-83 loss to Philadelphia on Tuesday night. "We cannot come out and play with that type of energy," coach Larry Drew said after the Hawks allowed a season-high 65 points in the first half. Horford practiced Friday for the first time since injuring his back prior to making the game-winning free throws with 0.6 seconds remaining in a 101-100 win Feb. 4 over the Los Angeles Clippers, but his status for Saturday is unclear. "It's a big difference (playing without Horford)," forward Marvin Williams told the Hawks' official website. "I think we've seen that on Tuesday. What Al brings to the table, you can't really replace it. "He is one of those players that really impact the game and to not have him out there on the floor is tough sometimes." Horford, who is averaging 16.2 points and a team-best 9.9 rebounds, also missed two games last month with a sprained right ankle. The first was a 100-59 home loss to New Orleans on Jan. 21, when the Hawks scored their fewest points since relocating to Atlanta in 1968. Fellow All-Star Joe Johnson, though, stepped up with 32 points the next night to lead the Hawks to a 103-87 win at Charlotte. Johnson was limited to a season-low-tying six points Tuesday against the 76ers, but he is averaging 26.6 points in his last 10 home meetings with Charlotte. The Hawks have held the Bobcats, who rank 28th in the league with 93.6 points per game, to an average of 88.7 while beating them seven straight times at home. Charlotte (22-31) is coming off a 94-89 loss Friday night versus New Jersey as point guard D.J. Augustin's recent struggles continued. Augustin, scoring 14.5 points per game, was held to four for the second time in five contests - over which he is shooting 30.9 percent from the field. Stephen Jackson, who is averaging 30.0 points - 11.0 more than his season mark - in his last three road games, scored 21 on Friday but wasn't pleased with his team's effort as the Nets snapped a 12-game road losing streak. "Our attitude was that they were gong to lay down and we'd just walk over them," said Jackson. "But we're not that good. We're not even close to being that good." While Augustin has registered 42 points in two losses versus the Hawks this season, Jackson has averaged just 9.5 on 21.4 percent shooting. The Bobcats, losers of six of eight, have slipped two games behind Indiana for eighth place in the Eastern Conference. "(Friday) was a must-win and we didn't show up," said Gerald Wallace, who's averaging 19.8 points and 11.0 rebounds in his last five games. Charlotte last defeated the Hawks on the road 96-75 on Jan. 19, 2007, thanks in part to Wallace's 18 points and 15 rebounds. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
