Jazz-Grizzlies Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Mar 21 2011 1:09AM The Memphis' Grizzlies success at home this season is one reason why they're contending for their first playoff berth in five seasons. The Utah Jazz's struggles away from home might keep them out of the postseason for the first time since 2006. The Jazz will try to cut their deficit in that Western Conference race by avoiding a fourth consecutive road defeat Monday night against the Grizzlies. After losing three of four, Memphis (38-32) maintained its lead on the West's final playoff berth with a 99-78 rout of Indiana on Saturday. Tony Allen had 19 points and a season-high 11 rebounds in the Grizzlies' 22nd win in 28 home contests, which helped them stay 1 1/2 games ahead of the Houston Rockets. "I'm looking at the standings every day for where we need to be," Allen said of his performance. "I'm just looking to do whatever I can to help whether it is passing out water, giving somebody a towel, congratulating someone or giving them advice about the previous play or the next play." The Jazz, meanwhile, couldn't overcome a slow start Sunday in Houston, where they lost 110-108 for their 15th defeat in 20 road games. In his return from left knee tendinitis, Paul Millsap had the second-best scoring performance of his career with 35 points, but his team didn't recover from an early 12-point deficit. "We made a lot of mistakes, and still had a chance to win. A lot of little mistakes cost us in the end," said center Al Jefferson, who had 17 points and matched a season high with 19 rebounds. The loss also proved costly in the playoff race as Utah fell from ninth to 11th in the West - one percentage point behind Phoenix. The Jazz (36-34), though, are just two games behind Memphis. They'll try to pare that deficit by winning by avoiding a third straight loss at the FedExForum, which would match their longest losing streak there. The Grizzlies' Rudy Gay scored 28 points and Zach Randolph had 26 in a 110-99 victory over Utah on Jan. 7 in Memphis, but Gay hasn't played since Feb. 15 because of an ailing left shoulder. Utah will try to take advantage of that absence to record its 14th win in 16 matchups with Memphis. Millsap had 22 points in a 98-92 victory Jan. 1, and C.J. Miles helped his team to a 95-84 win Dec. 6. Miles had a career-high 40 points Wednesday in a 119-104 victory over Minnesota. The Jazz are just 5-10 since Tyrone Corbin replaced Jerry Sloan as coach and 5-8 since trading All-Star point guard Deron Williams to New Jersey, but are seeking their third victory in four games. Williams averaged a team-best 21.7 points in the three previous games against the Grizzlies this season. Millsap was the second-leading scorer in those matchups, averaging 16.3. Randolph has led Memphis with 23.3 points and 13.7 rebounds per game versus the Jazz in 2010-11. He's averaged 27.5 points and 13.0 rebounds in his two career matchups with Utah at the FedExForum.
