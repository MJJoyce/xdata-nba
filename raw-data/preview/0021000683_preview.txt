A matchup with the slumping Toronto Raptors could produce another one. The Bucks will try to avoid a third straight loss at Air Canada Centre on Friday night when the Raptors look to end a nine-game skid. Shooting a league-worst 42.3 percent and averaging 91.2 points - also the lowest in the NBA - Milwaukee (17-26) rallied from a 11-point fourth-quarter deficit Wednesday for a 98-90 victory over Atlanta. It was just the 13th time the Bucks had reached point total. "That's foreign territory to us," point guard Earl Boykins said after scoring 11 of his 20 points in the final 12 minutes. "We looked like a hell of an offensive team." Starting point guard Brandon Jennings will likely miss his 19th straight game recovering from a broken left foot, and John Salmons (strained right hip) and Drew Gooden (plantar fasciitis) are both questionable to return, but it might not matter versus Toronto's defense. The Raptors (13-33) are allowing 109.8 points per game over their last four - 4.9 more than their season average - and are on the verge of losing 10 in a row for the first time since March 26-April 12, 2006. Leading Philadelphia by nine after the first quarter Wednesday, Toronto dropped its fourth straight at home as its zone defense was shredded in the 107-94 loss. "I thought our defense was very porous all night," said coach Jay Triano, whose team will try to avoid its first 0-5 stretch at Air Canada Centre since March 29-April 9, 2006. "They kind of got in to where they wanted to go." The play of second-year guard DeMar DeRozan has been a bright spot for the Raptors - he's averaging 25.2 over the last six games - but the club knows it needs to make a stronger commitment to the defensive end. Toronto has lost 25 of 31 when allowing at least 100 points. "I think in games we show spurts that we could be a good defensive team, but sometimes teams break us down," DeRozan said. The Raptors, though, have done a solid job slowing down Milwaukee in its last eight visits, holding the Bucks to 93.5 points per game while winning six times. In the teams' only matchup at Air Canada Centre in 2009-10, Toronto overcame a 15-point deficit and limited Milwaukee to 5 of 26 from 3-point range in a 101-96 victory on Jan. 22, 2010. Raptors leading scorer Andrea Bargnani missed that game with a sore lower back, but two days earlier he had 10 points in a 113-107 loss in Milwaukee. Bucks center Andrew Bogut scored 27 with 12 rebounds in that matchup, and he averaged 20.3 points, 8.7 boards 2.3 blocks in three games versus the Raptors last season.
