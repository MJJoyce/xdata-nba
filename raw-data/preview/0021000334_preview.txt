If they can duplicate their recent performances against the Minnesota Timberwolves, that drought could end Friday night. Detroit will attempt to snap its seven-game road skid by earning its sixth consecutive win at the Target Center. Already averaging an NBA-worst 87.5 points on the road, the Pistons' scoring has proved even more meager during their losing streak. Detroit is averaging 81.9 and had its second-worst shooting performance of the season (37.5 percent) during Wednesday night's 93-74 loss at New Orleans. "We couldn't score. Our guys were trying hard," said coach John Kuester, whose team has lost six of seven overall. "When the ball is not going in the hole, it puts you in a bind and you have to put so much pressure on your defense." If there's some hope for Kuester's beleaguered club, it's the chance to face a Minnesota team that's one of the league's worst defensive squads. The Pistons (7-16) have averaged 101.2 points and shot 46.0 percent during their five consecutive road wins in the series. Losers in eight of nine, the Timberwolves (5-17) are allowing 109.4 points per game and have kept an opponent under the century mark only four times. That's helped spoil some strong efforts from an offense that's averaged 102.3 points - 107.0 at home. Minnesota scored 40 points in a quarter for the first time this season to open Wednesday night's game against visiting Oklahoma City, but saw an 18-point lead evaporate in a 111-103 defeat. The Timberwolves allowed 31 points in each of the next two quarters and were outscored 27-17 in the final period. With its fourth loss in five home contests, Minnesota dropped to 1-8 in games decided by eight points or fewer. Michael Beasley scored at least 25 points for the 10th time in 13 games with 26, and Kevin Love had 22 points and 21 rebounds for his fifth 20-20 performance. The Timberwolves' young stars, though, were 3 of 18 from the field in the fourth quarter. "We got to learn how to finish games. That's our biggest problem," Beasley said. "We got to find a way to grind it out." The Timberwolves held an 11-point lead entering the fourth quarter at home April 14 against Detroit but were outscored 35-19 en route to a 103-98 loss. Charlie Villanueva had 13 of his 16 points in that quarter as the Pistons posted their third straight win over Minnesota and sixth in seven games.
