Pistons-Mavericks Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Nov 22 2010 8:18PM The Dallas Mavericks have been one of the league's best defensive teams, but their offense continues to struggle. They may not be able to afford such a discrepancy against a Detroit Pistons team that is playing well offensively. The Mavericks look to win their fifth straight over Detroit on Tuesday night. Dallas (8-4) has held seven straight opponents to fewer than 100 points, its longest stretch since the 2007-08 season. The Mavericks are among the top five in the NBA in scoring defense, holding opponents to 92.3 points per game. "We're trying to be the best zone team in basketball," coach Rick Carlisle said after a 98-93 victory at Atlanta on Saturday. "It's challenging. We have to play to our length and experience and our knowledge of the game." The Mavericks avoided a third straight loss Saturday, one night after being outrebounded 59-34 in an 88-83 home defeat to Chicago. Dallas bounced back to outrebound Atlanta 40-37, including 10 offensive boards. Dirk Nowitzki finished with 21 points and seven rebounds. He's averaging 27.8 points and 8.5 boards in the last four games but isn't getting much help. Dallas, which is averaging 96.2 points - nearly six fewer than last season - has scored more than 100 only three times and has been held below that mark the last five games. Detroit is having more offensive success, but its defense has been struggling. The Pistons have averaged 103.0 points over their last five games but are giving up that same amount. They beat Washington 115-110 in overtime Sunday to improve to 5-3 following an 0-5 start. Defense was an area Detroit was hoping to improve upon after giving up 99.1 points per game last season - its most since 1999-2000 when it allowed 102.0. However, it's being outrebounded by almost five per game - one of the highest differentials in the league. While the Pistons try to improve defensively, they'll continue to rely on their offense. On Sunday, Charlie Villanueva had 25 points and 11 rebounds while Richard Hamilton matched his season high with 27 points - 12 in overtime. "He's always there. Rip's been struggling a little bit but we know what type of player he is," Villanueva said. "We know what he brings to the table. Today he showed what he is capable of doing." Hamilton had averaged 9.2 points while shooting 36.0 percent in his previous five games, but he finished 11 of 21 from the field. The 32-year-old was limited to 46 games last season because of injuries. "I think that's the first time all season that I was allowed to play my game and that's just moving without the ball and things like that," he said. The Mavericks have won six of the last seven meetings with the Pistons, taking three straight in Dallas. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
