Despite a bruised knee, Love is expected to be on the floor Wednesday night as he tries to set the NBA record for most consecutive double-doubles, and the Timberwolves look to avoid a fourth straight defeat by extending the Indiana Pacers' losing streak to five games. Should he record a double-double in this contest, Love will surpass Hall of Famer Moses Malone, who had 51 in a row over two seasons in 1978-79. Though Love missed practice Tuesday, the Timberwolves do not believe his sore knee will keep him out of action. "It's a heck of an accomplishment to be that consistent and put up the kind of numbers he's been putting up," Timberwolves coach Kurt Rambis said. "It's very, very difficult to do that kind of thing." Love, who made his first All-Star appearance last month, has averaged 21.8 points with 16.3 rebounds and posted 11 games with at least 20 points and 20 boards since the streak began Nov. 22. However, the Timberwolves (15-50) are 11-40 during the stretch and have lost 11 of their last 13. "I'd be jumping for joy if we were winning and everybody was playing great including myself," Love said after he finished with 23 points and 17 rebounds in Monday's 108-105 loss to Dallas. "I'm just going out there and playing hard and it is just kind of happening for me. But it is kind of an afterthought because we aren't winning." Still, he would consider the moment more special if he makes history in front of the home crowd. "The Target Center, all the fans, the Twin Cities, all of Minnesota have been great all year," Love said. "They've had our backs. I can't imagine what it's going to be like when we really start winning and turn that corner." Love had 22 points and 15 rebounds in a 116-105 loss at Indiana on Feb. 11. Though the Pacers (27-36) have won three of four against the Timberwolves, they fell 116-109 in their last trip to Minnesota on Jan. 8, 2010. Indiana star Danny Granger had 19 points in that contest and versus Minnesota last month, but has averaged 14.5 on 34.0 percent shooting during the Pacers' four-game skid. He had 11, and went 4 of 11 from the field in Tuesday's 110-100 loss to Philadelphia. The Pacers, who hold a one-game lead over Charlotte for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, have lost eight of 11 following a 7-1 stretch after Frank Vogel replaced the fired Jim O'Brien as coach on Jan. 31. Indiana has struggled on defense lately, allowing 110.2 points while losing five of six. "Our guys have to do better," Vogel said. "They understand it, I understand it. We're not getting it done defensively and not moving the ball enough." Forward Tyler Hansbrough had 26 points against Philadelphia, and has averaged 16.0 off the bench the last six games. "Hansbrough was unbelievable," 76ers coach Doug Collins said. "That guy is a really, really good player. He's really good." Hansbrough scored 14 points versus Minnesota last month.
