Raptors-Bucks Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 08 2011 1:45AM Despite their recent struggles, the Milwaukee Bucks' postseason hopes remain very much alive. They'll look to get back on track with a nonthreatening upcoming schedule. The Bucks will try to avoid matching a season-worst five-game losing streak when they host the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday night. After coming up empty on its three-game road trip, Milwaukee fell 89-78 to visiting Detroit on Saturday night, prompting a blunt assessment from center Andrew Bogut. "There's no excuse for our effort, we played terribly offensively, defensively," said Bogut, who had 18 points and nine rebounds. "Talent doesn't cut it in this league. We're a talented team, but we're not good enough at the moment. "Whether we find that in practice, or we find it wherever we find it, we need to find it before Tuesday. We have two winnable games coming up; we'll go from there." The Bucks (19-30), who are 2 1/2 games behind Indiana for eighth place in the Eastern Conference, have a chance to improve their position with four of their next five contests against opponents who currently own losing records - including a meeting with struggling Washington on Wednesday. While Bogut was one of only two players to record double-digit points Saturday, it was a different story Jan. 28, when Milwaukee posted its highest scoring output of the season in a 116-110 overtime win at Toronto. Six players had at least 10 points while Bogut scored 24 and Corey Maggette and Ersan Ilyasova recorded season bests with 29 and 25, respectively. Brandon Jennings, who leads the team with 15.8 points per game, has averaged just 5.2 on 25.6 percent shooting over five contests since returning from a 19-game absence due to a broken foot. Milwaukee's 91.3 points per game rank last in the league but it could take advantage of a Raptors defense allowing an average of 105.3 points during a nine-game road losing streak. Carlos Delfino, whom the Raptors dealt to Milwaukee in 2009, is averaging 15.0 points in four games against his former team since the trade. Toronto hasn't lost 10 straight as the visiting team within one season since a franchise-worst 11-game slide Dec. 1, 2004-Jan. 14, 2005. The Raptors (14-37) snapped a season-worst 13-game overall losing streak with a 111-100 win Friday night over Minnesota thanks in large part to Andrea Bargnani's 30 points. Bargnani, who is averaging a team-best 21.1 points, was limited to 13.0 per game on 23.5 percent shooting over his previous three contests. He is averaging just 9.8 points at Milwaukee over his career. Amir Johnson, who was acquired by Toronto in the Delfino deal, also came up big Friday with 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting with 12 rebounds. "Amir was unbelievable," coach Jay Triano said. "His line is almost perfect basketball for a power forward." Johnson is averaging 18.4 points - 8.0 more than his season mark - and 10.2 boards over his last five games, including a season-high 24-point effort with 12 rebounds in the Jan. 28 loss to the Bucks. Leandro Barbosa, averaging 13.4 points, has missed the Raptors' last 12 games with a strained right hamstring but practiced Monday and could return in this one. The Bucks have taken five of seven in the series while averaging 107.3 points. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
