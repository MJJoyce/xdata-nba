Nuggets-Kings Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Mar 05 2013 2:56AM As good as the Denver Nuggets have been on their home floor, they haven't been able to string wins together on the road often. The Nuggets, however, have to be feeling confident as they try for their first three-game road winning streak on Tuesday night against a Sacramento Kings team they've dominated this season. Denver (39-22) has had little trouble piling up wins at home and claimed its 11th straight victory at the Pepsi Center by beating Atlanta 104-88 on Monday. Corey Brewer finished with 22 points and Ty Lawson had 18 as the Nuggets matched Miami's NBA-best 26-3 home record. They've also won six of seven overall to trail fourth-place Memphis by 1 1/2 games in the Western Conference playoff picture. "It's the energy, the altitude, but we're also jelling as a team," Brewer said. "We're starting to play together and we know each other a little bit." While Denver hasn't had the same success on the road, they are making small strides. The Nuggets, who are just 13-19 away from home, lost four in a row before ending the road slide with a 113-99 win at Charlotte on Feb. 23 and a 111-109 victory at Portland on Wednesday. Now they appear poised to capture their third straight road victory for the first time since wrapping up last season with a four-game win streak. Denver has seven straight victories in this series - three coming in Sacramento - while the Kings are trying to win consecutive games for the first time in almost a month. The Nuggets have won the first two meetings this season in lopsided fashion. JaVale McGee had 19 points and Danilo Gallinari added 18 in a 122-97 win at Sacramento on Dec. 16, and Lawson and Andre Iguodala combined for 46 in a 121-93 rout in Denver on Jan. 26. Gallinari, however, has totaled just 14 points in his last two games while playing through a nagging thigh injury. The Nuggets, whose plus-3.5 rebound differential ranks third in the league, have outrebounded the Kings 103-82 in the two wins. Sacramento, meanwhile, is 27th in that category, getting outrebounded by 3.3 per contest. While Denver has averaged 121.0 points on 51.8 percent shooting in the last four meetings, the Kings may be one of the few teams that can keep up with the Nuggets thanks to their recent scoring surge. Sacramento (21-40) poured in a season-high 43 points in the third quarter en route to a 119-83 victory over Charlotte on Sunday. John Salmons had 22 points and Jason Thompson added 18 and 14 rebounds to lead the Kings, who have reached 100 points in 10 of 11 contests. Following a season-worst six-game losing streak, Sacramento has won two of three overall and is 11-7 at home since Dec. 5. "It's good to be home and not eating room-service food," Thompson said. "We play differently at home than we do on the road." Marcus Thornton, who also had 18 against the Bobcats, is playing his best basketball heading into this contest. He's averaging 24.8 points on 58.2 percent shooting - including 14 of 29 from 3-point range - in his last four games. The Kings have averaged 110.7 points and hit 104-of-240 (43.3 percent) from 3-point range over their last 11 games. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
