Hawks-Kings Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Jan 03 2011 7:17PM Despite Joe Johnson's shooting struggles, it isn't stopping his teammates from trying to get him the ball. Coming off one of his highest-scoring performances of the season, Johnson tries to help the Atlanta Hawks win back-to-back road games for the first time since late November when they meet the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night. Atlanta (22-14) won for the second time in its last eight road games Sunday, 107-98 over the Los Angeles Clippers. Johnson finished with 29 points, Jamal Crawford had 24 and Josh Smith added 22 points and 10 rebounds. After being held to 18 points in the opening quarter, the Hawks trailed by as many as 16, but Johnson had 11 points in the fourth as Atlanta went on to outscore the Clippers 37-24. Johnson, who missed 14 of 20 field-goal attempts in a 103-94 loss at Oklahoma City on Friday, shot 7 of 20 on Sunday but scored 14 points at the free-throw line. It was Johnson's highest point total since finishing with a season-best 34 against Phoenix on Nov. 7. He has averaged 18.8 points on 38.2 percent shooting in nine games since returning from elbow surgery that kept him out nine contests. "Just as soon as that elbow heals at 100 percent, he will be back into form," coach Larry Drew said. Johnson is looking to help Atlanta improve on its inconsistent play away from home. The Hawks are a respectable 10-9 on the road, but they dropped six of their last seven before Sunday and hadn't reached 100 points in the previous 11 games outside of Atlanta. The Hawks will continue their trip - which ends Wednesday against Utah - without forward Marvin Williams, who has missed the last two games with a lower-back injury. Even without him, they shouldn't have much trouble against the Kings (7-24), who haven't defeated a team that currently owns a winning record and are looking to win consecutive games for the first time since Oct. 30-Nov. 1. Sacramento, though, has won two of three after winning twice in its previous 24 games. The Kings rallied from 14 down to beating Phoenix 94-89 on Sunday as rookie center DeMarcus Cousins scored 13 of his season-high 28 points in the fourth quarter and Francisco Garcia added 20 points and 11 rebounds. "It's our progress as a team," Cousins said. "Two weeks ago we probably would have had 10 turnovers down the stretch and they would've shot 90 percent in the fourth quarter. But it was a great team effort." Cousins has averaged 21.7 points and 10.7 rebounds and shot 56.5 percent in the last three games after totaling 13 points while shooting 22.2 percent in the previous three. The Kings are looking to win three straight at home for the first time since a four-game run Nov. 25-Dec. 2, 2009. Atlanta has won five in a row over Sacramento.
