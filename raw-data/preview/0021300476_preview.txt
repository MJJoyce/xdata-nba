Nets-Thunder Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Jan 01 2014 6:38PM Since winning their first 13 home games, the Oklahoma City Thunder have dropped two of three on their own floor. It seems unlikely they'd lose consecutive games there for the first time in almost two years Thursday night, with the reeling Brooklyn Nets looking to avoid their worst road skid of the season. After scoring fewer than 100 points twice during its unbeaten home start, Oklahoma City (25-6) has failed to reach the 100 mark twice in the past three at Chesapeake Energy Arena. The Western Conference-leading Thunder shot a season-worst 36.8 percent in a 104-98 home loss to Toronto on Dec. 22 and had a three-game winning streak snapped in Tuesday's 98-94 loss to visiting Portland. The Trail Blazers rallied from a 13-point second-half deficit to close within a half-game of the Northwest Division leaders. Oklahoma City shot 43.9 percent while going 3 of 14 from 3-point range, falling to 2-1 since Russell Westbrook underwent his third surgery since injuring his knee during the playoffs in April. Since finishing with 24 points and shooting a season-worst 5 of 16 against the Raptors, Kevin Durant has averaged 33.3 points, 11.5 rebounds and 54.0 percent from the field in four games. The four-time All-Star had 37 points and 14 boards Tuesday, though he managed one point in the fourth quarter and missed an open 11-foot jumper that would have tied the game in the final seconds. "My teammates told me if I was contested that I probably would have made the shot," Durant said. "I'm sure that's going to replay in my mind for the rest of the night. I wish I could have hit that for my team." Durant has fared well against the Nets franchise, averaging 29.7 points and 55.6 percent shooting while leading the Thunder to wins in six of seven meetings. The only loss came in the most recent matchup, 110-93 at home Jan. 2, 2013. Brooklyn's Joe Johnson led the way with 33 points and five 3-pointers in that contest, while Brook Lopez added 25 and Deron Williams scored 19 with 13 assists. Lopez is averaging a team-high 20.7 points but is expected to miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Though Johnson has scored 8.0 per game and shot 31.3 percent in his last three, he's averaged 28.7 points in his previous three at Oklahoma City. Williams has averaged 20.7 points and 14.0 assists in his last three visits. The Thunder, who haven't dropped two in a row at home since March 2012, may not have much trouble getting back on track there. The Nets (10-21), 4-12 away from Brooklyn, are trying to avoid their fifth straight road loss after dropping the first two on this three-game trip by a combined 35 points. Paul Pierce was limited to six points Tuesday while Kevin Garnett was held to two, failing to make a field goal for the second time in his 19-year career in a 113-92 loss at San Antonio. "I don't think I've been a part of this many blowouts in one season, already," Pierce said. "At some point we've got to have our pride come from each individual and say we've had enough of this. It's extremely embarrassing." Copyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
