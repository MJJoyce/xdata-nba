The Bucks have had little trouble putting up points against the Memphis Grizzlies of late. The Bucks try to match their season high with a third straight victory while looking to continue their recent success against the visiting Grizzlies on Saturday night. Milwaukee (16-24) has struggled at the offensive end of the floor, averaging 91.5 points and shooting 42.3 percent this season. However, the Bucks have shot 49.3 percent and scored at least 100 while winning two straight after a 2-8 stretch, Andrew Bogut scored 23 points, Corey Maggette had 20 and Keyon Dooling added 12 with 11 assists in Friday's 102-88 victory at lowly Cleveland. The Bucks have managed to generate offense despite leading scorer Brandon Jennings (17.9 points per game) still out with a broken foot and with John Salmons (13.8 ppg) possibly missing a third straight game with hip soreness. Bogut, who has been plagued by a strength-sapping virus, bounced back Friday after totaling 26 points his previous three contests. The veteran center underwent blood tests and continues to hope for the best. "I have my fingers crossed it's nothing too bad," said Bogut, who scored just six points in 36 minutes in Wednesday's 100-87 win over Washington. "There's definitely something there because my lymph nodes are all swollen. We have to figure out what it is and get the right medication and get rid of it." Milwaukee did receive a boost with the return of starting swingman Carlos Delfino, who scored nine points in 22 minutes against the Cavaliers after missing more than two months with a concussion. "It's a big moment for him and a good moment for us," coach Scott Skiles said of Delfino, who averaged 12.9 points before he was hurt. "Carlos is a very good player for us. We're glad to have him back." Milwaukee hopes to continue its surge against the Grizzlies (20-23). The Bucks have averaged 103.8 points while winning seven of eight in the series. Bogut has averaged 17.0 points and totaled 50 rebounds - 33 on the offensive end - in his last five games versus Memphis. He had 18 with 11 boards in Milwaukee's 108-103 overtime home victory in the teams' most recent meeting March 28. Zach Randolph paced the Grizzlies with 31 points and 15 rebounds in that contest. The veteran forward continued his strong season with 29 points and 19 boards to help Memphis avoid a third straight loss, 115-110 over Houston on Friday. "I wanted the ball every time in the clutch, and I had it going," said Randolph, who was a big reason the Grizzlies scored a season-high 72 points in the paint. "I was feeling good out there." Randolph also tied a franchise record with his ninth straight double-double, averaging 24.8 points and 15.2 rebounds during that span. Randolph has recorded six double-doubles in his last seven games at Milwaukee. Rudy Gay has scored 22 points in each of the last two games. He's averaged 24.0 on 56.3 percent shooting his last three at the Bradley Center. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
