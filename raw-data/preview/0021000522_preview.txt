Nuggets-Clippers Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Jan 04 2011 7:43PM Playing his second game following the death of his sister, Carmelo Anthony had one of his better performances of the season, once again putting a focus on his future in Denver. Anthony looks to lead the Nuggets to their third win in a row this season and fifth straight against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night at Staples Center. Denver (20-13) extended its winning streak by beating Houston 113-106 on Monday. Anthony had 33 points and 11 rebounds for his fourth game this season of at least 30 and 10 - including three in his last six games since Dec. 12. "I thought he was the best player on the court," coach George Karl said. Anthony was 13 of 14 from the free-throw line, but 10 of 25 from the field after a 6-for-22 shooting performance in a win over Sacramento on Saturday. That was his first game back after missing five following the death of his sister. Anthony also was 4 for 4 from the line against the Kings. "That is one of the strengths of my game, getting to the free-throw line and tonight I was effective at that," he said. Anthony's performance came after an NBA.com report said he turned down another contract extension offer by the Nuggets last week. While Anthony's future with the Nuggets remains uncertain, Denver has won four in a row and begins a favorable set of back-to-back road games. Denver will next travel to face Western Conference-worst Sacramento on Thursday. Anthony is averaging 24.4 points in 26 career games against the Clippers. He was 14 of 20 from the floor and finished with 30 points in Denver's 111-104 win over Los Angeles on Nov. 5. The Nuggets may have Al Harrington back after missing four games with a dislocated right thumb. He would provide frontcourt depth needed to defend Blake Griffin, who has averaged 21.5 points and 11.0 rebounds versus the Nuggets during his rookie season. Griffin has recorded 21 straight double-doubles. He scored 19 of his 31 points in the first half of a 107-98 loss to Atlanta on Sunday and also had 15 rebounds, but the Clippers blew a 16-point lead to lose their second straight. After scoring 38 second-half points in a 103-95 loss to Utah on Wednesday, Los Angeles was outscored 65-45 after the break by the Hawks. "We just have to do a better job of finishing out games," said Griffin, who is averaging 28.3 points and 13.3 rebounds over the last four games. "Our offense got a little stagnant and they hit some shots." Eric Gordon, who came in averaging 25.6 points in his previous five games, was held to 10 against the Hawks. After spending the final 8:27 of the first quarter on the bench with two fouls, he scored six points in the second half, but made only one of his nine field-goal attempts. The last four meetings between the Nuggets and Clippers have been in Denver. Los Angeles won the last game at Staples Center, 106-99 on Nov. 20, 2009 - its only victory in the last 12 matchups.
