Spurs-Warriors Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 24 2011 2:21AM The NBA-leading San Antonio Spurs are coming off their worst offensive performance of the season. A matchup with the Golden State Warriors could help them get back on track. The Spurs look for an 11th consecutive win over the host Warriors when the teams meet Monday night. San Antonio's eight-game winning streak came to an unceremonious end Saturday night with a 96-72 defeat at New Orleans - its most lopsided loss of 2010-11, and lowest scoring output since 2007-08. "You have to give them credit for their defense," said Tim Duncan, who had six points while shooting 2 of 11. "They were very good (Saturday) and they did not give us a lot of stuff. On top of that, we missed a lot of shots." San Antonio (37-7) shot 36.2 percent from the field for the night, and let the game slip away after getting outscored 31-10 in the third quarter. The 10 points were San Antonio's fewest in a quarter since recording nine in the fourth of a 90-64 loss at Utah on April 4, 2008, while the 72 points were the fewest for the Spurs since a 72-65 win at Portland two days later. Tony Parker was the only Spurs starter to score in double figures Saturday. He finished with 10 points but failed to record an assist for the first time this season. Manu Ginobili, averaging a team-best 18.5 points, was held to a season-low four. He has scored at least 27 points in two of his last three road games against the Warriors. The Spurs have enjoyed plenty of success offensively against Golden State, averaging 115.4 points on 51.5-percent shooting during their winning streak in the series, which reached 10 after a 118-98 road victory Nov. 30 and a 111-94 home win Dec. 8. The Warriors are allowing 106.5 points per game on the season - third-most in the league. The Warriors (19-24) had their season-best four-game winning streak snapped Saturday night with a 113-109 loss at the Los Angeles Clippers. Monta Ellis, whose 25.8 points per game rank fourth in the league, shot 6 of 21 while playing through an ankle injury and finished with 17 points. Stephen Curry, who had 34 points in Friday night's 119-112 overtime win over Sacramento, scored 32 in the loss to the Clippers. "I think he played well; he's looking for and taking his shots more," Warriors coach Keith Smart said. "I think he needs to do that more than trying to pass to everyone. That opens up his passing game, by trying to make plays for himself first then others." Curry also had 32 points against the Spurs in November, but sprained his ankle during the Dec. 8 loss and failed to score a point. Golden State is opening a season-high eight-game stretch at home, where it has won four straight and seven of eight. The Warriors are averaging 107.9 points at home - second-most in the NBA. The Spurs have lost three straight when allowing 100 points or more. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
