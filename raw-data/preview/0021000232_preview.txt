The Warriors will try to bounce back as they go for their third consecutive win - and second this season - over the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night. Golden State (7-8) opened 6-2 for its best start in 16 years, but it's dropped six of seven since. The Warriors fell 111-101 to Houston on Wednesday, committing a season-high 35 fouls and getting outscored 39-12 at the foul line. "There's not a lot to say," coach Keith Smart said. "We didn't get off to a good start and we had to fight back the whole game. We are not making smart decisions and making critical errors at the wrong time." The Warriors have been outrebounded in each of their last four games by an average of 6.5 boards, which is a big reason the team is giving up 114.8 points per game while only scoring 99.5. Smart's team didn't have its best game against Memphis on Nov. 3, but still emerged with a 115-109 victory. The Warriors had 20 turnovers and shot 41.3 percent, but Monta Ellis scored 39 points to overcome the 35 from Rudy Gay for the Grizzlies (6-9). Ellis has struggled with his shot since injuring his hip against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday after a hard foul. Before that game, Ellis was averaging 27.7 points and shooting 52 percent. After finishing the Lakers game with five points on 2-of-10 shooting in 23 minutes, Ellis has shot 32.6 percent the last two games while averaging 19.0 points. However, playing against the Grizzlies always seems to get him going. He's averaged 27.3 points in the last six games against them. Memphis is looking to win a season-high three straight. It posted back-to-back victories for the third time after recording a shocking 97-95 win over Miami last Saturday and a 105-84 victory over Detroit on Wednesday. It was the fewest points the Grizzlies, who are yielding 101.9 points per game, have allowed. They outscored the Pistons 33-18 in the third period and opened the fourth quarter with a 10-0 spurt. "It is important because we are under .500, and the fact that we have home games, we can make up some ground," coach Lionel Hollins said. "We should be able to make up ground. Not saying we will, but we should be able to because we are home and it is tougher to win on the road for sure. Memphis closes its three-game homestand Friday. Four of its wins have come at home. The Grizzlies may provide a bigger challenge to the Warriors with Zach Randolph in the lineup. He missed the previous meeting with a bruised tailbone, but he has a double-double in each of his last four games, averaging 20.0 points and 13.3 rebounds. Memphis has won three straight at home over Golden State. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
