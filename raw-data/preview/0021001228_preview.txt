Grizzlies-Clippers Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Apr 13 2011 2:44AM Leading scorer and rebounder Zach Randolph was surprisingly held out by the Memphis Grizzlies their last time out in a crucial game with playoff seeding on the line. With Randolph unlikely to be available again, the visiting Grizzlies try for a fourth win in five meetings with the Los Angeles Clippers as the teams conclude their regular seasons Wednesday night. Memphis (46-35) fell 102-89 at Portland on Tuesday to drop into a seventh-place tie with New Orleans and lost any chance it had of earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference. The Hornets, who play at Dallas on Wednesday, own the tiebreaker over the Grizzlies thanks to a better Southwest Division record. Randolph, averaging 20.1 points and 12.2 rebounds, was in uniform but remained on the bench for the duration of Tuesday's game. "I didn't want to play Zach these last two games because I want to get him rested and fresh," coach Lionel Hollins said. "He hurt his elbow and he has the bad knee and I just didn't want to have him out there banging for two more games when we have the playoffs going." Defensive specialist Tony Allen was also held out due to swelling in his left knee and ankle. Randolph, who spent part of the 2008-09 season with the Clippers, is averaging just 11.5 points on 35.7 percent shooting in his last two road games against his former team. In his first start in more than three months, O.J. Mayo had 13 points and five rebounds while Mike Conley scored 17. "I think our mindset is that teams will fall where they may, and we're just going to have to deal with whoever we play and be focused for that team," said Conley, who scored 20 points in an 82-81 loss to Los Angeles on April 5. "Any way you cut it, you're going to play a good team." The Clippers (31-50) had lost three straight and four of five to Memphis prior to beating the Grizzlies last week on the first stop of their recent four-game trip. Los Angeles, though, went on to lose the remaining three games - including a 99-78 defeat to Houston on Saturday in which it matched its lowest scoring output of the season. Rookie of the year favorite Blake Griffin scored 13 points on 6 of 18 shooting but also had 10 rebounds for his 62nd double-double - third most in the league. "You could say I let us down but the weight isn't only on my shoulders," said Griffin, averaging 11.5 points - 10.9 less than his season mark - on 40.0 percent shooting in his last two meetings with Memphis. "It's about improvement and growth on a consistent basis but I always think I can get better." The Clippers averaged 91.0 points during their trip, but have won 15 of 20 at home while scoring 104.0 per game. Memphis is holding teams to an average of 90.3 points on 43.9 percent shooting during a 9-3 run. Los Angeles is 7-21 when shooing under 44.0 percent. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
