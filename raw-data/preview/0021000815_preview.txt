Clippers-Bucks Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Feb 14 2011 12:08AM The Los Angeles Clippers are woeful on the road. The same can't be said for Blake Griffin. Griffin and the undermanned Clippers attempt to win for just the second time in 11 road games when they face the sputtering Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night. Los Angeles (20-34) is only nine wins shy of its total from last season, and would be much closer if not for a dismal 4-20 away record, tying Minnesota for the fewest road victories in the Western Conference. Those road issues have showed few signs of changing during a 1-9 stretch that has seen the Clippers give up an average of 106.9 points. After facing Milwaukee (20-33), Los Angeles visits the Timberwolves on Wednesday before entering the All-Star break. The team will return to the court for a three-game road trip to cap this stretch of 11 consecutive games away from Staples Center. The Clippers have dropped five of six thus far through that stretch. Griffin, though, is doing his part with 20.8 points per game and 12.6 rebounds over the last 10 road contests, tallying 21 points and 15 boards in a 98-93 loss at Toronto on Sunday. The former top overall draft pick leads all rookies with 22.7 points and 12.7 rebounds, and will be the team's lone representative at the All-Star game at Staples Center on Sunday. "It's tough to lose games, period, no matter what part of the year it is or how many games you've won before that," Griffin said. Griffin feels injuries to guard Eric Gordon (wrist), center Chris Kaman (ankle) and forward Craig Smith (back) are taking a toll on the team. Gordon has a team-high 24.1 points per game, and won't be back until after the All-Star break. "Missing Eric Gordon is huge for us," Griffin said. "He's our leading scorer. Having him out kind of shrinks the court a little bit. We'll be glad to have him back." Griffin was superb in a 105-98 home win over the Bucks on Jan. 31, scoring 32 points with 11 rebounds and six assists. The Bucks have dropped seven of eight following a 103-97 home loss to Indiana on Saturday. "We didn't run the plays, just didn't execute the plays like we should," said swingman John Salmons, who made 4 of 11 shots for nine points. "Didn't have any ball movement." Milwaukee could use a better performance from its starters after they combined for 46 points against the Pacers. Brandon Jennings has struggled since returning from a broken foot, making 32.7 percent of his shots - 25.0 from beyond the arc - in nine games after missing the previous 19. The point guard finished with 10 points on 3-for-10 shooting Saturday. He's averaging 16.7 points in three meetings with the Clippers, scoring 12 in last month's loss. The Bucks could be without forward Corey Maggette after he left Saturday's loss midway through the first quarter with lower back pain. Maggette, averaging 13.1 points, scored 25 in the most recent matchup with Los Angeles. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
