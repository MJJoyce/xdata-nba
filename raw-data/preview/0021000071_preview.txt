The Bobcats seek their second victory when they visit The Palace of Auburn Hills looking extend the Pistons' worst start in 30 years. Charlotte (1-3) defeated New Jersey 85-83 on Wednesday, as D.J. Augustin's two go-ahead free throws with 30.9 seconds left capped a 16-4 game-ending run. "It would have been tough for us to be 0-4," Augustin said. "We needed this win badly. It's going to give us a boost of confidence going into Detroit." Boris Diaw scored 24 points and Gerald Wallace finished with 20 and 11 rebounds for his first double-double. Last season, Wallace had 33 double-doubles while averaging 18.2 points and 10.0 rebounds. He's averaging 19.0 points this season, but only 7.3 boards. The Bobcats could use more performances like that from Diaw, who also helped Charlotte put together its best defensive effort of the season after it allowed its previous three opponents to average 101 points. Defense is especially important for the Bobcats as they continue to struggle offensively. They posted their lowest point total of the season Wednesday and failed to reach 90 for the third time. "We still have some issues, but the effort was great," coach Larry Brown told the Bobcats' official website. "We had a lot of people make plays and give us a chance to win." Charlotte will try for back-to-back victories as it visits Detroit (0-5), which is off to its worst start since it was 0-7 in 1980-81. "Nobody envisioned it but obviously it's something we're going to deal with now and try to figure out (how) to go forward with this," forward Tayshaun Prince said after a 94-85 loss to Atlanta on Wednesday. Ben Gordon continued his impressive start with 22 points, but after helping Detroit take a five-point lead in the fourth quarter, the Hawks closed the game on an 18-4 run. While the Pistons held an opponent to fewer than 100 points for the first time this season, the Hawks shot 53.7 percent and outscored Detroit 50-37 in the second half. Gordon had eight points after the break and went scoreless after making his first two shots of the fourth quarter. "We have to work on our execution down the stretch," Gordon said. "We just have to build on the positives. If we continue to do better we'll definitely start to have some success." Gordon averaged a career-low 13.8 points in a disappointing and injury-marred first season with Detroit, but he's scoring 20.2 in 2010-11. He started the last two games after coming off the bench in the first three and is shooting 59 percent. Gordon's struggles last season weren't a result of facing the Bobcats, as he averaged 21.5 points and 7.5 assists in two games against them. Although the Pistons lost two of three to the Bobcats last season, they won the only meeting at The Palace 98-75 on Nov. 11 to improve to 8-2 all-time against Charlotte at home.
