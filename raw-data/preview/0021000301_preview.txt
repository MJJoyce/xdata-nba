Clippers-Trail Blazers Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Dec 04 2010 1:44PM A visit from the lowly Los Angeles Clippers would seem to give the Portland Trail Blazers one of their best chances to snap a season-worst losing streak. With the way the Blazers have played lately, even a win in that matchup is far from a sure thing. While attempting to avoid a seventh consecutive defeat, Portland will try to keep the Clippers winless on the road Sunday night. The Trail Blazers' offensive struggles continued during Friday night's 83-79 loss at Washington, which had dropped its previous four games. Even the return of center Joel Przybilla from a knee injury that kept him out for nearly a year didn't help. Portland, averaging 86.8 points over its past six games, couldn't recover after being outscored 23-10 in the third quarter. After averaging 24.7 points in his previous three games, Wesley Matthews was held to five on 2-of-9 shooting. The Blazers (8-11) shot a season-worst 33.3 percent in the defeat and have connected at a meager 39 percent during their longest skid since they dropped eight straight to end the 2005-06 season. Even the team's All-Star and leading scorer, Brandon Roy, can't seem to find an answer. "We've lost six in a row, and we still haven't figured out what the problem is. It's tough. I don't really know - 19 games in, and we're losing the same way," Roy said. "Everybody is at a loss for words. (Coach Nate McMillan), he doesn't know what to say to us. And we don't know what to say to one another." Since the Clippers (4-16) relocated from San Diego before the 1984-85 season, Portland has won 50 of 58 home matchups. Overall, the Blazers are 79-16 in Portland against that franchise. The Blazers, though, lost to three sub-.500 teams during a four-game road trip that ended Friday. Along with the loss to the Wizards, they also fell to New Jersey and Philadelphia. For Portland, playing at home could make the difference. The Clippers enter this matchup having dropped all nine road games this season, and they're 3-36 away from home since Dec. 20. They suffered their latest road loss Friday night, sending Denver to the free-throw line 59 times - the NBA's highest total this season - in a 109-104 defeat. "It's tough to get into a defensive or offensive rhythm when we were sending them to the line every time," guard Baron Davis said. "You can't send a team to the line that many times." Eric Gordon topped 20 points for the seventh straight game with 24 and Blake Griffin recorded his seventh consecutive double-double with 17 points and 12 rebounds. Griffin had 20 points and 14 boards in his NBA debut Oct. 27 at home against the Blazers and Gordon scored 22 points. The Clippers, though, lost 98-88 as they were outscored 28-17 in the fourth quarter. Portland has won three straight and 10 of 12 over Los Angeles, which has also dropped three in a row at the Rose Garden. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
