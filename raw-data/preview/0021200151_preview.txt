Warriors-Mavericks Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Nov 19 2012 12:21AM Many of the Dallas Mavericks' best performances this season have come on their home court, which may not bode well for the visiting Golden State Warriors. Dallas seeks its 11th victory in the last 12 home matchups with Golden State as the teams meet Monday night. The Mavericks (6-5) ended a four-game road losing streak with a 103-95 win over Cleveland on Saturday, getting 19 points from O.J. Mayo and 15 points and eight rebounds from Chris Kaman. Dallas overcame 22 turnovers and shot 58.8 percent in the fourth quarter, when it used a pair of 9-0 runs to post its second win in six games. "We quit doing certifiably insane things with the basketball," coach Rick Carlisle said. "Right now, we're trying to figure out what kind of a team we are.  We've just got a lot of things going on, and it's important to pull together and make something good happen." Shawn Marion had 10 points and 10 boards while Vince Carter and Darren Collison added 14 points each. "We got a little bit of confidence," Collison told the team's official website. "This was a good team win. These are the wins that make you feel good, because we know we all did it together. "Hopefully we can take that same vibe on our homestand and get a little home cooking." The Mavericks, who play their next three at home, are 4-1 at American Airlines Center and scoring 107.6 points per game at home - the second-best average in the NBA to Miami's 116.5. Dallas has won 10 of the last 11 home matchups - including the postseason - with the Warriors, who are coming off a 119-109 loss at Oklahoma City on Sunday. Golden State (5-5) tied a season low for turnovers, but it was outscored 26-12 on fast-break points. "(Thirteen) turnovers for us is acceptable, but not when they wind up with fast-break dunks (and) 3-point shots," coach Mark Jackson said. "That's when it takes the life out of you." Stephen Curry scored 22 points and David Lee added 19 and 10 rebounds for the Warriors, who shot a season-best 52.4 percent and outscored the Thunder 58-32 in the paint. "We came here to get a win, but there are some good signs in this," Jackson said. "We're not satisfied, but we feel good about where we're headed. "That being said, if we limit some of the mistakes we made, it gets very interesting." Jackson has been impressed with rookie Harrison Barnes, who shot 5 of 11 and scored 12 points. The seventh overall pick is averaging 16.3 points while shooting 51.4 percent over his last three games. "He's playing very well," Jackson said. "He's battling defensively and he's attacking offensively." The Warriors, though, have lost three four on the road after winning their first two away from home. Curry is shooting 36.7 percent on the road, including 27.8 percent from 3-point rage, compared to 46.0 percent - 40.7 behind the arc - at home. Dallas has won eight of the last 10 overall matchups, including the most recent meeting April 20 when Carter scored 19 points and an injured Curry sat out the Mavericks' 104-94 home victory.
