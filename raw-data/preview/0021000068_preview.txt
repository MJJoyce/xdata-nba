He can't feel the same way about its offensive execution. The visiting Bucks look to avoid matching their worst start in a decade Friday night as they face an Indiana Pacers team trying to rebound from its worst performance of the season. While Milwaukee (1-4) is limiting opponents to 94.8 points per game on 44.2 percent shooting, the club is among the most inaccurate in the league from the field, hitting 40.5 percent. The Bucks missed 50 of 86 shots and couldn't hold a seven-point lead with 6:07 left in a 105-102 overtime loss at Boston on Wednesday. "... We did force them to miss a couple of times," Skiles told the Bucks' official website. "We just again tried to finish off the possessions and then got careless with the ball of couple of times and that all happened in a span of about a minute and a half and they're right back in it again." Milwaukee is on the verge of tying its 1-5 start of 2000-01. "We're going to stick with it," center Andrew Bogut said after a 21-point, 13-rebound performance. "We can win in Indiana and hopefully get something going here." Second-year point guard Brandon Jennings is looking to get his game back on track, as he's 5 of 20 from 3-point range and shooting 38.6 percent from the field. With Jennings on the floor, the Bucks have been outscored by an average of 15.3 points in their last three losses. "Hopefully this is a test for us and see how we need to play every night," Jennings said after scoring 13 points with a season-low four assists Wednesday. "We did a lot of good things tonight. Somebody's got to lose." Jennings averaged 17.0 points, 6.5 assists and 4.0 rebounds as Milwaukee won both matchups at Conseco Fieldhouse last season, its first victories in Indianapolis since 2004. Jennings and the Bucks will get their first look at point guard Darren Collison in a Pacers uniform. The former New Orleans Hornet, who averaged 20.0 points and 8.5 assists in two games against Milwaukee in 2009-10, is averaging 13.0 points and 5.0 assists this season while learning coach Jim O'Brien's system. Collison shot 4 of 16 and Indiana leading scorer Danny Granger was 2 for 14 as the Pacers (2-2) fell 101-75 at Philadelphia on Wednesday. "It was pathetic tonight," third-year center Roy Hibbert said after the team hit a season-worst 31.5 percent from the field. "It was really pathetic." Hibbert, though, has made great strides this season, scoring 16.0 points per game with 9.5 rebounds and 2.8 blocks. He'll be matched up with Bogut, who has averaged 20.7 points, 14.0 boards and 2.7 blocks in his last three at Conseco Fieldhouse. Bucks leading scorer Carlos Delfino is shooting 45.7 percent (16 for 35) from 3-point range, while the rest of the team is 14 for 58 from beyond the arc. The Pacers, opening a three-game homestand, took nine straight road games from the Bucks prior to last season. Milwaukee won all four meetings with Indiana in 2009-10, its first season sweep in this matchup since taking all six in 1981-82. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
