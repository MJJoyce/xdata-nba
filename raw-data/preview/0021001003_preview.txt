Nuggets-Hawks Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Mar 15 2011 10:47PM The Denver Nuggets have played well on the road of late. It remains to be seen if they can win in Atlanta. Trying to match a season high with a third straight win away from home, the Nuggets seek to beat the Hawks on the road Wednesday night for the first time in four seasons. Denver (40-27) is 13-20 away from the Pepsi Center this season but has won two straight and four of six on the road after opening a four-game trip Monday with a 114-103 victory at New Orleans. Point guard Ty Lawson had 23 points with 10 assists, and his backup Raymond Felton added 22 points and 12 assists as the Nuggets shot 53.3 percent in their third straight victory overall and ninth in 11 games. Lawson has averaged 19.3 points, 10.7 assists and shot 59.5 percent during the three-game winning streak. "We can't get too happy," forward Wilson Chandler told the Nuggets' official website after scoring 21 points. "It's the NBA. There are a lot of great teams. We play a lot of good teams on this road trip, so we've got to buckle down and stay focused." The Nuggets conclude this road trip with visits to Orlando and Miami. The Hawks, Magic and Heat are a combined 52 games above .500. Denver beat the Hawks (39-28) 100-90 at home on Feb. 28, but it has dropped three in a row and 18 of 20 at Atlanta. Still, coach George Karl has confidence that his team can maintain its recent road success. "To transfer our confidence onto the road is always going be a little more of a challenge," Karl told the Nuggets' official website. "To transfer our success defensively on the road (will be) a little more difficult. But I don't know. I kind of like these guys. I think I trust them a little bit." The Nuggets are giving up 106.3 points per game on the road for the season, but 99.2 over their last six away from home. Atlanta has shot 50.8 percent and averaged 112.7 points during its three-game home winning streak over the Nuggets. Hawks All-Star Joe Johnson has averaged 23.0 points in those games, and had 22 in last month's loss at Denver. Johnson, who had averaged 13.0 points on 41.1 percent shooting in his previous four games overall, snapped out of his slump in Atlanta's 110-85 win over Milwaukee on Tuesday, shooting 13 of 19 and scoring a season-high 36. "I had my legs under me," said Johnson, who will likely sport a black headband for the second straight game to protect the back of his scalp after undergoing a procedure to treat a skin infection. "It was just a feeling. I was just letting it go." In his first game back after missing Saturday's 91-82 win over Portland with a sore ankle, fellow All-Star Al Horford added 15 points in 31 minutes as the Hawks shot a season-high 63.0 percent. Atlanta has won two straight after losing four in a row. "Hopefully a game like this will give us some juice," coach Larry Drew said. Horford, who had 21 points and 16 rebounds at Denver last month, has averaged 16.8 points and 11.8 boards in his last six games versus the Nuggets. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
