76ers-Pacers Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Mar 07 2011 4:09PM In his first game back from injury, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala was not much of a factor in the last matchup with the Indiana Pacers. There's a good chance he'll make a much bigger impact Tuesday night. Iguodala and the surging 76ers go for a season-high third consecutive road win when they meet a Pacers team trying to hold on to the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Back in the starting lineup after missing seven games with tendinitis in his right Achilles', Iguodala scored a season-low one point with seven assists and four rebounds as the Pacers snapped a season-high nine-game road losing streak with a 111-103 victory Jan. 11. Iguodala has bounced back, recording three of his seven career triple-doubles in the last seven games, including two in a row. After scoring 22 points with 13 assists and 10 rebounds in Friday's 111-100 win over Minnesota, Iguodala had 15 points, 10 assists and 11 boards Sunday in a 125-117 overtime victory against Golden State. He is the first Sixer to record back-to-back triple-doubles since Aaron McKie in 2000-01. "Took overtime to get it tonight," Iguodala said. "It just feels good to see these guys have success winning in the NBA." Philadelphia (32-30), two games above .500 for the first time since the final month of 2008-09, is 29-17 since Nov. 27. Only six NBA teams have a better mark during that stretch. "We expected this from the start," said coach Doug Collins, whose team will try to win three straight road games for the first time since Jan. 31-Feb. 6, 2010. However, Philadelphia has lost three of four and six of nine at Conseco Fieldhouse while dropping 13 of 19 overall in this series. Indiana (27-35) enters the final matchup between these clubs following an 0-3 trip that ended with Saturday's 112-95 loss to Houston. The Pacers missed 17 of 24 first-quarter shots and trailed 29-18 after 12 minutes. Indiana has faced a double-digit deficit in the opening period in six of its last seven defeats. "They jumped on us early, and we never recovered," said leading scorer Danny Granger, who averaged 15.7 points - 5.2 below his season mark - on 33.3 percent shooting on the trip. "We played like a tired team and we need to turn things around." Indiana, which has dropped seven of 10 since opening 7-1 under interim coach Frank Vogel, allowed an average of 113.7 points on 48.0 percent shooting on the trip. Philadelphia is averaging 109.3 points and hitting 50.7 percent of its attempts from the field in its last seven games. The Pacers' last four-game losing streak was a season-worst 0-6 skid Jan. 14-26 that led to coach Jim O'Brien's firing Jan. 30. Indiana has won two of three in 2010-11 against the 76ers, who are trying to avoid losing the season series for the fourth time in six years. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
