The Hornets look to win their fourth straight when they host the Warriors on Wednesday night. New Orleans (21-14) has given up an average of 79.7 points on 40.2 percent shooting during a three-game winning streak. The opposition has been held to 22.4 percent from 3-point range (13 of 58) in that span. Following road wins over Boston and Washington, the Hornets returned home and defeated Philadelphia 84-77 on Monday. The 76ers shot 34.1 percent - the lowest mark by a New Orleans opponent this season. "The last three games we're 81, 81, 77 in terms of holding opponents under 85 points," coach Monty Williams said. "To do that in the NBA says a lot about your defense and it boils down to the guys not just making plays on offense, but defensively, also, getting rebounds." While the Hornets have stifled their opponents over the last week, that hasn't been the case recently against the Warriors (13-21). Golden State has scored 131 points in each of the last two meetings and both clubs have topped 100 in the past five. New Orleans, though, is focused on maintaining its defensive intensity going into its first matchup of the season with Golden State. "It's about continuing what we've been doing and trying to put some wins together," said David West, who has averaged 25.2 points and 12.4 rebounds in his last five games against the Warriors. The Hornets haven't won four in a row since opening the season with eight straight victories. They are 14-4 at home. Golden State is trying to close its five-game road trip on a high note after another second-half letdown in its last game. The Warriors have lost their last two, including a 110-90 defeat to Orlando on Monday, to fall to 1-3 on the trip. After blowing a 14-point halftime lead in Miami two nights earlier, Golden State was outscored 66-37 after the break by the Magic. The Warriors have shot 31.8 percent in the second half of their last two games. "Maybe we can just play a half and go home," said coach Keith Smart, whose team fell to 5-15 on the road. "We played very, very good basketball against two elite teams and for whatever reason, didn't come out in the second half and play at the level necessary to win." Starting center David Lee sat out with a bruised back and is day to day. Golden State is 1-8 without Lee, averaging 15.0 points and 10.1 rebounds. "It's a big body that we needed," guard Stephen Curry said. Curry is averaging 14.0 points in six games since missing six with a sprained ankle. He was scoring 20.1 per game before getting hurt. Monta Ellis is averaging 20.8 points in the last five games after a three-game stretch during which he averaged 39.7. He averaged 27.3 points and 9.0 assists in three games against Golden State last season. The Warriors have lost three straight in New Orleans. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
