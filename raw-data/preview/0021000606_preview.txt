A visit by the lowly Sacramento Kings could help coach Larry Drew's team start a new one. The Hawks try to bounce back from a rare loss at Philips Arena on Monday night when they face a Kings team looking to avoid a seventh straight defeat in this matchup. Going for its 11th consecutive home win, Atlanta (26-15) was denied a season high-tying sixth straight victory Saturday, falling 112-106 to Houston. The Hawks led by as many as nine in the second half, but Drew was unhappy that his team didn't make a better effort to feed the ball to the post. "We settled, we settled, we did not do the things that have been good to us," said Drew, whose team trails Orlando by one-half game for second place in the Southeast Division. "Driving and kicking, driving the ball to the basket. Tonight we settled for a lot of perimeter shots. Twenty-six 3s, that's too many for us. We're not going to win many games shooting 26 3s. We've got to pound the ball inside." Al Horford (24 points, 10 rebounds) and Josh Smith (21 points, 12 boards) present a tough matchup down low for Hawks' opponents, but letting Joe Johnson and Jamal Crawford create from the perimeter isn't much easier to stop. Johnson continues to shine since missing nine games last month following elbow surgery. He is averaging 27.7 points and shooting 50.8 percent over the last six games after scoring 30 on Saturday. Crawford had eight in the loss, but is still averaging 24.4 in his last seven contests and leads the league with 16.3 per game off the bench. The Hawks backcourt duo combined for 60 points in a 108-102 victory at Sacramento on Jan. 4. "Joe Johnson and Jamal Crawford are a two-headed monster," Kings rookie DeMarcus Cousins said after scoring 16 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter of that defeat. "I mean Joe might be one of the best players at his size. They both are incredible players and have a lot of talent." Sacramento (9-29) has plenty of young talent with Cousins, 2010 rookie of the year Tyreke Evans and Jason Thompson, but the team is still learning how to close out games. After leading by 11 in their best offensive first half of the season, the Kings scored just 36 second-half points in Saturday's 110-106 loss against Detroit. Sacramento is 1-4 on its six-game eastern trip. "That's a hard one," said coach Paul Westphal, whose team snapped a 12-game road losing streak with a 93-83 victory over the New York Knicks on Friday. "We did so many good things, but we didn't come away with a win, because we couldn't ever guard them effectively." The Kings are allowing 106.9 points per game while losing 14 of 17 on the road. Sacramento has been even worse while losing its last four visits to Atlanta, giving up an average of 112.3 points with the Hawks shooting 50.9 percent. Crawford had a team-high 20 points and Johnson added 17 with seven assists as Atlanta shot 51.3 percent in a 108-97 home win against the Kings on Jan. 20. Evans scored 24 in the loss, and he is averaging 22.7 in three career matchups with the Hawks. Sacramento's last victory against Atlanta was 119-107 at home Feb. 20, 2008.
