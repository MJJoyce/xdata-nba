They'll likely need another strong offensive effort against the up-tempo Golden State Warriors, but that hasn't been a problem for them lately. The Bucks look to win their fourth straight in the series Saturday night when they meet a Warriors team wrapping up a five-game road trip. Milwaukee (4-5) entered Tuesday's game against New York last in the NBA in scoring at 89.6 points per game and second-worst in field goal shooting at 39.9 percent, but set season highs in both categories that night and did it again Wednesday. After shooting 51.3 percent in a 107-80 win over the Knicks, the Bucks hit 51.7 percent in a 108-91 victory in Atlanta. Coach Scott Skiles said the Bucks should receive a confidence boost from easily beating the team that eliminated them from the first round of last season's playoffs. "Hey, look, if you come in here and are up (30) points over the Hawks, you're obviously doing something right out there," Skiles said. Another positive from the two victories is Milwaukee didn't make any sacrifices on the defensive end to get its offense on track. The Bucks are still one of the league's top teams defensively, allowing an average of 91.3 points, and have forced at least 17 turnovers in four consecutive games. While Skiles focuses on defense, Golden State has one of the top offenses in the league, averaging 104.7 points. Milwaukee's offense hasn't had much trouble keeping up with the Warriors lately, however, averaging 123.0 points in winning the last three games. In the last meeting at the Bradley Center on Nov. 14, 2009, Brandon Jennings had a franchise rookie record with 55 points in the Bucks' 129-125 victory. Jennings has keyed Milwaukee's recent turnaround. He scored 19 points in each of the last two games while shooting 51.7 percent - committing only one turnover - after averaging 14.3 points on 39.1 percent shooting in the first seven. Corey Maggette, acquired from Golden State over the summer, also has come up big in the last two, averaging 17.0 points on 11-of-14 shooting. He averaged 10.8 points and shot 31.3 percent in the previous five games. The Warriors (6-3) hope a day off can help their offense come out with a bit more energy after a sluggish performance in Thursday's 120-90 loss to Chicago. One night after a 122-117 victory in New York, Golden State looked tired against the Bulls, falling behind by as many as 30 points in the second quarter. Monta Ellis had 24 points to lead the Warriors, who dropped to 2-2 on the trip. "We just didn't have the juice to compete," coach Keith Smart said. "We just have to move on from here. There are some nights you know when your players are not in it and the juice is not there." The Warriors were without David Lee after he suffered a cut on his left elbow when he inadvertently struck New York's Wilson Chandler in the mouth Wednesday. Lee, averaging 14.3 points and 11.3 rebounds in his first eight games for the Warriors, hopes to play Saturday. Lee averaged 20.7 points and 11.7 rebounds in three games against the Bucks in 2009-10 with the Knicks, while Ellis averaged 29.5 points in Golden State's two losses to Milwaukee last season.
