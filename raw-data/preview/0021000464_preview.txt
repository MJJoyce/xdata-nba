That's not something the Indiana Pacers have been able to say often. The Pacers have lost six of eight - all by double digits - heading into the opener of a home-and-home set with the Wizards on Wednesday night in the nation's capital. Washington's first 17 losses came by an average of 13.5 points, but it's offered a glimmer of hope lately despite having dropped 10 of 11 and 14 of 16. The Wizards (7-22) have held leads well into the fourth quarter of two of their last four losses, but they haven't been able to close. Washington blew a five-point lead with 32.6 seconds left in a 95-94 loss to Miami on Dec. 18, then let a 10-point edge with 10 minutes left slip away Monday in a 100-93 loss at red-hot Houston. "We have to close out games," rookie point guard John Wall said. "We were right there in it, but like coach (Flip Saunders) said, when they're making the run and coming back, we're always trying to go for the home run instead of just chipping away at time." The Pacers (13-16), on the other hand, seem to be regressing after an encouraging first six weeks. Just three of Indiana's losses during an 11-10 start came by more than 10 points, but it's been getting less competitive of late. The Pacers' two wins in their last eight games came at home against woeful Cleveland and slumping New Orleans, and their six losses have all come by double digits. Indiana led visiting Boston by one after three quarters Tuesday, but the Celtics began the fourth on an 11-0 run that proved to be the difference in a 95-83 victory. "When you lead good teams like we did tonight and you let them make a run at you, you're not going to be able to hang in there with them," said Danny Granger, who missed 16 of his 21 shots. The Pacers have given up an average of 26.1 points in the final 12 minutes of their nine games since Dec. 11. Washington has yielded 19.3 per game in the fourth during that stretch - second-best in the league. The Wizards, however, are 30th in fourth-quarter scoring over that seven-game stretch, averaging 19.0 points. As shaky as the Pacers' defense has been late in games recently, their offensive shortcomings are the most significant reason for their struggles. Indiana averaged 100.4 points and shot 45.3 percent during its first 21 games. Since, it's averaged 89.1 points and shot just 39.5 percent. The Pacers are averaging 87.3 points during a six-game road slide. Granger has been perhaps the biggest culprit. He's shot 34.8 percent since Dec. 11, and Indiana's success has been tied to his ability to get good looks. It's 10-3 when Granger shoots better than 40 percent, and 3-12 when he's failed to crack that mark. Facing the Wizards might be what Granger needs to get back on track. He's averaged 27.1 points and shot 47.0 percent in his last eight games versus Washington. The Pacers took three of four in the series last season, with Granger shooting 4 of 16 in the lone loss. The teams meet again Friday at Conseco Fieldhouse. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
