Mavericks-Bobcats Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Feb 05 2011 1:47AM With Dirk Nowitzki playing at a high level again, the Dallas Mavericks have looked all but unstoppable over the last two weeks. As far as the Charlotte Bobcats are concerned, that's been true for much longer. Nowitzki and the Mavericks will try stay unbeaten against the Bobcats on Saturday night at Time Warner Cable Arena, where they will go for their eighth straight win overall. Nowitzki continues to get better after he sat out nine games from Dec. 28-Jan. 14 with a sprained right knee, during which Dallas (34-15) went 2-7. After initially struggling to regain his shooting touch, Nowitzki has shot 65.4 percent the last four games while scoring 29 points in each of the last two. He helped lead Dallas to a 101-97 victory at Eastern Conference-leading Boston on Friday. Nowitzki scored 21 points in the second half and when he had trouble handling the ball on a late possession, he found Jason Kidd, who hit a 3-pointer with 2.5 seconds left to give Dallas a 99-97 lead. "You've got so many players that have been through (close games) on this team," said former Bobcats center Tyson Chandler, who had 14 points and 15 rebounds. "We've got options to go to down the stretch." The win was Dallas' seventh straight, improving the team to 15-7 on the road. Saturday will close the Mavericks' three-game road trip, which they opened with a 113-97 win at New York on Wednesday. Dallas is looking to remain undefeated against the Bobcats after improving to 13-0 all-time in the series with a 101-86 home victory Oct. 27. Charlotte has beaten every other team. Nowitzki has been key to the Mavericks' success against Charlotte. He's averaging 26.2 points over his career against the Bobcats, his highest average against any opponent besides Boston. Nowitzki had 28 points and 13 rebounds in the last meeting, shooting 11 of 13 from the field and 6 of 6 from the free-throw line. Charlotte (21-28) continues a difficult stretch after a 109-97 loss to Miami on Friday. Returning home following a 4-2 road trip, the Bobcats struggled late, finishing with 16 turnovers, which led to 31 Heat points. The Bobcats were within two in the final minute of the third quarter, but the Heat went on a 14-4 run to take a 92-80 lead early in the fourth. "I think at the end a veteran team with veteran players got things going their way," said Gerald Wallace, who scored 25 points after combining for 31 the previous four games. "Some mental mistakes and some lapses on defense turned out to be the game." Stephen Jackson also had 25 points. He's averaging 29.3 in the last three games. Charlotte, which is in eighth place in the Eastern Conference, has struggled against other playoff contenders, also losing to Utah and Atlanta during the last two weeks to fall to 5-20 against teams currently in playoff position. The Bobcats' tough stretch continues Monday, when the team will host Boston. "We'll see what we're about," coach Paul Silas said. To beat the Mavericks, Charlotte likely must increase its production on the offensive end. The Bobcats are averaging 88.7 points in the all-time series and have never surpassed 99. However, they are averaging only 90 points in their last four games overall. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
