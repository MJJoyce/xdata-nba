Clippers-Magic Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Feb 07 2011 4:25PM Blake Griffin's stellar season hasn't made up for the inconsistent play of the remaining Los Angeles Clippers. The struggling Orlando Magic hope to take advantage for the second time this season. Orlando looks to break out of its funk and win its ninth straight meeting against visiting Los Angeles on Tuesday night. The Magic (32-20) lost for the third time in four games Sunday, falling 91-80 to Eastern Conference-leading Boston. They shot a dismal 3 of 24 from 3-point range, and the 12.5 percent conversion rate was their lowest since going 2 of 18 (11.1 percent) in a loss to Milwaukee on April 13, 2009. Orlando slipped 1 1/2 games behind Atlanta for fourth place in the East and 5 1/2 behind Southeast Division-leading Miami despite Dwight Howard's 28 points and 13 rebounds. "The Miami Heat and Boston are rolling right now," Howard said. "We're going to be OK. We've got things we've got to work on." Gilbert Arenas was held scoreless in a game when he attempted a shot for the first time since March 21, 2004, and Hedo Turkoglu finished 1 for 10 from the field. "I just could not find anything for us to run to get a decent shot," coach Stan Van Gundy said. The Magic rode a 35-point first quarter to a 94-85 victory against the Clippers on Dec. 12, when Griffin scored 27 points and grabbed 16 rebounds. However, Los Angeles has continued to struggle without their leading scorer Eric Gordon, who is averaging 24.1 points. Gordon scored 28 points in the loss to Orlando, but he hasn't played since Jan. 22 because of a wrist injury and may be out until after the All-Star break. The Clippers (19-31) are 2-5 without him, including Sunday's 97-79 loss to Miami. Griffin had his 42nd double-double with 21 points and 16 boards, but he couldn't keep L.A. from losing its third straight as the Heat bench outscored the Clippers' 33-14. Griffin is averaging 22.9 points and fourth in the NBA in rebounding at 12.8 per game. Howard is second averaging 13.7 boards. "We just weren't sharp and weren't good offensively," Clippers coach Vinny Del Negro said. "The guys battled. Our bench was poor today. We didn't get anything from the bench, which really hurt us. We're just not deep enough now to go through those lulls." Griffin absorbed a flagrant foul from Miami's Eddie House in the fourth quarter, but appeared to shake it off after falling into the basket support. Baron Davis had 14 points but also committed a season high-tying seven turnovers. He had only four points in the last meeting with Orlando. DeAndre Jordan has averaged 4.0 points and 3.0 rebounds in 24.0 minutes over his last three games after a season-high 16-point effort Jan. 31 in a win against Milwaukee. The Clippers are currently 0-2 on their 11-game road trip, which doesn't bode well for a team that's just 3-17 away from home. They haven't won in Orlando since Feb. 1, 2006, losing four straight since. Howard is averaging 23.0 points and 11.3 rebounds in his last three against L.A.
