Spurs-Heat Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Mar 13 2011 9:21PM The Miami Heat hit a low point during their five-game losing streak earlier this month when the San Antonio Spurs handed them a 30-point defeat. With their skid behind them, they'll be looking for some revenge. Miami hosts San Antonio on Monday night in another showdown between two of the NBA's top teams. The Heat fell 125-95 on March 4 at San Antonio in a game that was never seriously in doubt after Miami got outscored 36-12 in the first quarter. The Heat (45-21) dropped their following two games to a pair of other division leaders - Chicago and Boston - before finally ending their skid Thursday with a 94-88 victory to cap a season sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers. After Sunday's 118-85 rout of Memphis, they seem to be back on track to challenge for the Eastern Conference's top spot. Miami is currently three games behind the first-place Celtics, and 2 1/2 games back of the Bulls. "Anytime that we can have a good team effort, that's always great," said Chris Bosh, who had 18 points and 10 rebounds against the Grizzlies. "But the fact that we had a big lead after halftime and we held it, that's what I'm most happy with." Dwyane Wade finished with 28 points, nine assists, five rebounds and five blocks. LeBron James added 27 points and Mike Bibby hit 5 of 5 3-pointers en route to 17 points off the bench. Wade struggled a bit in the last meeting with San Antonio, scoring 19 points but shooting 8 of 18 with a game-high five turnovers. James led all scorers with 26 points, while Bosh had 17 and 14 rebounds. Sunday's victory against Memphis improved the Heat to only 15-18 against teams .500 or better, but beating the Spurs could change any perception that they can't beat the league's elite. League-leading San Antonio (54-12), which is seven games ahead of second-place Dallas in the Western Conference, beat Houston 115-107 on Saturday for its third straight win. "It was a great win and a very physical game," said Tony Parker, who scored a team-high 21 points. "We made the big stops and shots at the end." The Spurs made plenty of big shots against the Heat in their last meeting, hitting eight 3-pointers in the first quarter en route to a franchise-record 17 from long range. Eight Spurs scored in double figures, led by 20 points from Manu Ginobili. Despite winning all three games, the defensive-minded Spurs have allowed more than 100 points in three straight contests for the first time since doing it in five consecutive games Dec. 16-23. However, the Heat haven't scored more than 100 versus San Antonio since a 115-114 overtime loss at home Jan. 20, 1995. The Spurs hold a 34-13 edge in the all-time series, including four straight wins. Miami will be without center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who is out indefinitely with an infected foot.
