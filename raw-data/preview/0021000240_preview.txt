Bobcats-Bucks Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Nov 27 2010 1:05AM The way Milwaukee has played of late, not even a visit from the Charlotte Bobcats will guarantee the Bucks' struggles will come to an end. Looking to avoid a sixth straight loss, the Bucks try to continue their home dominance of the Bobcats on Saturday night. Coming off its first playoff appearance in four seasons, Milwaukee (5-10) was saddled with some high expectations but opened with four losses in five games and is now mired in its longest skid of the season. The Bucks didn't show any signs of reversing their fortunes in Friday's 103-89 loss at Detroit. Averaging an NBA-low 90.5 points, Milwaukee has been held to 82.5 points per game on 36.9 percent shooting in its last four games. "The main thing is we need to put the ball in the basket," said guard Brandon Jennings, who had a game-high 25 points against the Pistons. Though Jennings is averaging a team-leading 16.9 points, he has been wildly inconsistent during his team's five-game skid. He scored 31 points against the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 16, but had 12 three nights later at Philadelphia. After scoring 25 against Oklahoma City last Saturday, Jennings was held to three on 1-of-10 shooting at Cleveland on Wednesday. If that trend is to continue, the second-year guard could be in for a rough night Saturday, but he has averaged 22.7 points on 48.9 percent shooting in three home games versus Charlotte. Jennings had 20 and 10 assists in the Bucks' 98-88 win over the Bobcats at the Bradley Center on Oct. 30. Milwaukee is 11-1 all-time against the Bobcats at the Bradley Center. Charlotte has averaged 89.0 points during a six-game losing streak at Milwaukee, while the Bucks have scored 98.8 per game during that span. However, Milwaukee could be without center Andrew Bogut (11.6 ppg, 10.9 rpg) for a third straight game because of back spasms. Swingman Carlos Delfino (12.9 ppg) will miss his ninth consecutive contest due to a neck sprain and concussion-like symptoms. Charlotte (6-10) avoided a third straight loss by beating Houston 99-89 at home Friday. The Bobcats will now try to win consecutive games for the second time this season. Boris Diaw had 22 points with 10 rebounds and Gerald Wallace added 21 with 14 boards as the Bobcats won for the fifth time in nine games. It was the first double-double of the season for Diaw, who averages 13.0 points but has scored at least 20 in two of his last four games. "When Boris plays like that we're hard to beat," Wallace said. "We tell him that every night. He thinks pass first and shoot second. We want him to think shot first and pass second. Because when he's aggressive we're a whole lot better as a team." Diaw has been a non-factor while averaging 8.3 points in 21 games against Milwaukee. D.J. Augustin scored 26 points and Stephen Jackson added 23 for the Bobcats at Milwaukee last month. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
