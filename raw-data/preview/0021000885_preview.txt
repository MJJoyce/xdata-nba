Rockets-Hornets Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Feb 27 2011 1:21AM Emeka Okafor's return sparked the New Orleans Hornets to another victory, and potentially getting leading scorer David West back would greatly increase their chances for a three-game winning streak. West is expected back in the lineup Sunday night when the Hornets attempt to beat the Rockets for a sixth consecutive time. Okafor missed 10 games because of a strained left hip, and New Orleans (35-25) didn't cope well without its starting center by losing seven times in that span. Okafor made his presence felt in his return Friday, scoring 10 points with seven rebounds, three blocks and two steals in a 95-81 win at Minnesota. The Hornets have won consecutive games for the first time since a 10-game streak Jan. 9-26, and facing the Rockets could help them stay hot. New Orleans has won five in a row against Houston (29-31), including both matchups this season. However, the Rockets have averaged 118.3 points during a three-game win streak that continued with a 123-108 victory over New Jersey on Saturday. Okafor is averaging 11.1 points and a team-high 10.1 boards, while West leads New Orleans with 19.1 points per game and ranks second with 7.7 rebounds. The forward missed Friday's victory due to a death in his family. West has averages of 27.2 points and 9.0 boards over the last six meetings with Houston. He scored 29 points and grabbed nine boards to help New Orleans erase a 16-point, third-quarter deficit in a 110-105 win at Houston on Jan. 14. Okafor had 17 points and 15 rebounds in that matchup, helping the Hornets outscore the Rockets 48-36 in the paint. Carl Landry, a member of the Rockets from 2007-10, gives New Orleans an added presence under the basket. The forward had four points and five rebounds off the bench Friday, two nights after being acquired from Sacramento in a trade for guard Marcus Thornton. Landry was averaging 11.8 points and 4.8 boards prior to the deal, and is already enjoying himself with the Hornets. "I like it here already. I like the defense," he said. All-Star point guard Chris Paul said he's finally feeling comfortable after undergoing knee surgery last year, totaling 36 points and 18 assists the last two games. "I feel like I have my legs a little bit right now. I'm playing without that brace," Paul said. "I feel like I have a little burst of speed here and there, and I know it opens up everybody else when I'm putting pressure on people." Paul should be looking forward to this matchup after averaging 26.0 points and 10.0 assists his last four home games against Houston. While the Hornets are welcoming key players back, the Rockets are adjusting to life without Shane Battier and Aaron Brooks. The Rockets traded the duo to Memphis and Phoenix, respectively, prior to Thursday's deadline. They didn't miss a beat without them Saturday, as Chase Budinger scored 27 points while starting in place of Battier in a 123-108 win over New Jersey. "It definitely felt weird," said Budinger, who had 30 points in a 124-119 win at Cleveland on Wednesday. Kevin Martin has scored 30 points in consecutive games, and had 26 against New Orleans last month. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
