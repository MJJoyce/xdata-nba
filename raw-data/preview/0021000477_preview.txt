Warriors-Bobcats Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Dec 30 2010 4:00PM A coaching change might have been what the Charlotte Bobcats needed to start winning games. The Bobcats look for a season-high third straight victory under new coach Paul Silas while trying to continue their recent success against the visiting Golden State Warriors on Friday afternoon. Charlotte (11-19) ranked near the bottom of the league averaging 91.8 points under Larry Brown, but the Bobcats averaged 103.0 in wins over Detroit and Cleveland since Silas and his up-tempo offensive system replaced the fired Brown on Dec. 22. The Bobcats are 6-3 when scoring at least 100 points. "I think everybody is loving it right now," said guard D.J. Augustin, who is averaging 13.6 points but has totaled 55 on 20-of-29 shooting the last two games. "Before, we were trying to run the play all the way through and getting shot clock violations," Augustin added. "Now guys are getting open shots and taking them." Augustin had 28 points and Stephen Jackson scored a season-high 38 in a 101-92 victory over the Cavaliers on Wednesday. "It's a good feeling knowing the coaches are allowing you to use your brain and make basketball plays and not be sort of a robot out there," said Jackson, averaging 30.5 points the last two contests. Silas, the 67-year-old former Charlotte Hornets coach, won't take too much credit for the Bobcats' recent success. "Well, I'm the greatest coach in this industry!" Silas said. "I told those guys from the start that attitude, confidence, and going out there and playing are what's most important." The Bobcats should be confident while trying for a fourth consecutive victory over Golden State (12-19). Even without Silas' guidance, the Bobcats have matched Golden State's up-tempo style, averaging 111.0 points while winning four of five meetings. Gerald Wallace, who had nine points and 10 rebounds Wednesday after missing five games with a sprained ankle, has averaged 22.0 points and 9.5 boards in his last four versus Golden State. The Bobcats should have a good idea of what to expect from the Warriors after Silas' son, Stephen, left his assistant coaching position with Golden State to join his father's staff. Golden State had its season-high three-game winning streak snapped with a 103-93 loss at Atlanta in Wednesday's opener of a five-game trip. The Warriors are 4-13 on the road, where they have lost 11 of 13. "We didn't have the necessary energy that we needed to play at a very high level," coach Keith Smart told the Warriors' official website. "We'll move on to the next game." Though Dorell Wright has averaged 30.0 points the last two games after posting a career-high 32 with 11 rebounds at Atlanta, the Warriors need guards Monta Ellis (25.5 ppg) and Stephen Curry (18.8) to bounce back from a poor outing. Ellis and Curry each shot 4 of 13 from the field and combined for 21 points. Ellis has averaged 25.0 points on 58.0 percent shooting in his last three games versus Charlotte. Curry, who grew up in Charlotte, has averaged 10.0 points and shot 26.8 percent in three games since missing six with an ankle injury. He totaled 47 points in two meetings with the Bobcats last season. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
