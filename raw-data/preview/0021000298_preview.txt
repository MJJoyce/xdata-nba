Hornets-Spurs Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Dec 04 2010 5:34PM The San Antonio Spurs and New Orleans Hornets were two of the top teams in the Western Conference when they met last month, but extending that success has been more of a struggle for New Orleans recently. The Spurs look to avenge one of their three losses this season when they host the Hornets, who hope to have leading-scorer David West back in the lineup Sunday night. San Antonio (16-3) has the NBA's best record and improved to 8-2 at home with a 107-101 victory over Minnesota on Friday. The Spurs overcame a 15-point deficit, outscoring the Timberwolves 36-15 in the fourth quarter. Tim Duncan had 22 points and 10 rebounds while Tony Parker and George Hill each scored 20. "Obviously that's not the situation we want to be in on a nightly basis, but given the situation, it was the best outcome possible," said Duncan, who was held to 23 points in the previous two games combined. "We defended great in that fourth quarter, we held them to 15 points and found a way to win." The 15-point fourth quarter by the Timberwolves helped salvage an otherwise rare defensive lapse for the Spurs, who gave up 100 points for the first time in four games. They were outrebounded 59-37 and allowed a season-worst 24 offensive boards. San Antonio has also fallen behind by double digits in both games against New Orleans (13-6) this season. However, the Spurs overcame a 17-point margin for a 109-95 victory in New Orleans on Nov. 28 after losing 99-90 at home Oct. 30. Duncan seemed to be the difference maker between those games. He was held to seven points in the loss, but had 21 in the most recent meeting. Playing the Hornets in San Antonio, though, has been difficult recently for Duncan, a two-time MVP. He's averaged 9.3 points in the last three games against them at the AT&T Center compared to 21.3 in the last three at New Orleans Arena. The slumping Hornets hope that trend continues. They are looking to get back on track after losing for the fifth time in seven games, 100-92 to New York on Friday. Trevor Ariza led the team with a season-high 21 points while Chris Paul added 17 and 10 assists. Two nights after holding Charlotte to 73 points in a win, New Orleans was sloppy at both ends of the court, allowing the Knicks to shoot 13 of 30 from 3-point range while committing 19 turnovers, which led to 29 New York points. "I'm always surprised when our guys don't play with a sense of urgency because that's who we are," first-year coach Monty Williams. "I think that every time you get a chance to play in this league you have to come out with an attitude that you're trying to prove yourself. "I didn't see it in 48 minutes. I saw it in spurts, but not in 48 minutes." After winning 11 of their first 12 games while averaging 97.5 points, the Hornets have averaged 92.0 points in the last seven, and missing West didn't help. West, who is averaging 18.8 points and 6.6 rebounds, sat out with a stomach virus. It's not certain if West, who has averaged 21.1 points and 8.5 rebounds in his last eight games against the Spurs, will play Sunday. Jason Smith started in his place Friday - the first time this season the Hornets used a different lineup. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
