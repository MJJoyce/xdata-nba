Warriors-Clippers Preview By MATT BECKER Posted Jan 08 2011 1:12PM Over the next month, the Golden State Warriors only need to worry about playing in two arenas. Before opening a stretch of the schedule filled with home games, the Warriors make the first of two trips to Staples Center on Sunday to face the Los Angeles Clippers in a matchup of teams suddenly amassing wins after struggling mightily. Playing with a healthy roster for one of the few times this season, Golden State (15-21) had little trouble against lowly Cleveland on Friday, hitting 14 3-pointers and leading by double figures for most of the second half in a 116-98 win. "I don't want to beat a dead horse but it's good when we've got a full roster," said David Lee, who had 22 points and 14 rebounds. "You got guys that can support you. You can go out there and play all out." Monta Ellis led the Warriors with 32 points but was equally effective dishing off, finishing with 10 assists. Coach Keith Smart has been pressing his veteran guard to do more passing in recent weeks. Golden State is 4-0 when Ellis has at least 10 assists. One of those instances occurred in the only meeting of the season between these Pacific Division rivals, when Ellis had 15 points and 11 assists in a 109-91 home win Oct. 29. Dorell Wright finished with a game-high 24 points for Golden State, which hit 14 of 24 3-pointers. After this meeting, the Warriors will play 13 of 14 at Oracle Arena with the only road game coming against the Clippers on Jan. 22. They won't travel outside of California until visiting Phoenix on Feb. 10. This stretch gives Golden State a good chance to reach .500, particularly because it's finally at full strength. Andris Biedrins came back Wednesday after missing nine games with a sprained ankle, the same injury which caused Stephen Curry to sit out six games before returning on Christmas. "It's our time," Ellis said. "We've got all our guys back, we're playing great basketball and we're going to try to put it all together and try to get some wins." The Warriors have won two straight and six of nine after losing 16 of 19. The Clippers (11-24) also are playing much better after going through an awful stretch. Los Angeles hasn't played since beating Denver 106-93 on Wednesday. It was the sixth win in nine games for the Clippers, who had dropped 17 of their previous 21. Blake Griffin had 22 points and 18 rebounds against the Nuggets to tie a franchise record with his 22nd consecutive double-double. DeAndre Jordan finished with 14 points, tied a career high with 20 rebounds and had six blocks, giving him 20 in the past three games. "We are just trying to play our game," reserve guard Eric Bledsoe said. " ... As long as everybody does their role, we'll be able to get the win." Los Angeles had one of its best defensive efforts of the season Wednesday, limiting the Nuggets to 37.5 percent shooting and holding a 57-43 rebounding advantage. The Clippers won for the fifth time in six games when limiting opponents under 100 points, but they're 1-17 when allowing teams to reach the century mark. Holding Golden State below 100 points could be tough. The Warriors are averaging 106.0 points in their last 10 games and 116.5 in the last four against Los Angeles while winning three. They have hit triple figures in 12 of 13 meetings since the 2007-08 season, going 9-4. These teams meet again Friday at Oracle Arena. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
