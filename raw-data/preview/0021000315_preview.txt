Wizards-Lakers Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Dec 06 2010 9:01PM The Los Angeles Lakers' losing streak is over, but coach Phil Jackson is not sure if the two-time defending NBA champions have truly turned things around. Continued dominance of the Washington Wizards might not make things any clearer. Coming off their first win in more than a week, the Lakers look to keep the Wizards winless on the road with an eighth straight victory in their series Tuesday night. Los Angeles (14-6) had little trouble ending its four-game skid with a 113-80 home win over Sacramento on Friday. "It feels good to get back on a winning track," swingman Shannon Brown said. "We're not letting ourselves sink down into anything." Though the Lakers shot a season-high 56.6 percent to end their longest losing streak since April 2007, it came against one of the NBA's lowest-scoring teams that also ranks near the bottom of the league in field-goal percentage defense. That was enough to keep Jackson wondering if his team turned the corner or caught a break in the schedule after losing in the final minutes to Utah, Indiana, Memphis and Houston following a 13-2 start. "It's hard to judge," Jackson said. "Have we broken free from the bonds that held us back, or did we just get a weak sister at this time of year?" Those same questions could again face the Lakers if they run Washington's road record to 0-11. Los Angeles has averaged 112.0 points on 53.1-percent shooting while winning its last seven games against the Wizards since Gilbert Arenas scored 60 in Washington's 147-141 overtime win at Staples Center on Dec. 17, 2006. Kobe Bryant had 45 points in that contest but has averaged 20.3 in three home games versus Washington since then. Bryant scored 22 points against the Kings and felt the Lakers' dominance could lead to a run in the positive direction. "All I'm going to say is that we played the right way," Bryant said. "It felt good to win, but it's more about doing the right things to be successful." Dealing with a strained hamstring, Pau Gasol added 16 points to help the Lakers outscore the Kings 68-30 in the paint. Los Angeles should get stronger inside as Andrew Bynum, who averaged a career-high 15.0 points in 2009-10, nears his season debut. Though the 7-footer went through his first full practice since offseason knee surgery Monday, he is unlikely to play in this contest. Washington (6-13) couldn't snap its road skid in the opener of a three-game trip Sunday, losing 125-108 at Phoenix. The Wizards, who join the Los Angeles Clippers as the only teams without a victory away from home, are giving up 112.8 points per game on the road. Washington allowed its second straight road opponent to shoot 58.0 percent from the field Sunday. Andray Blatche scored 24 points, Nick Young added 20 and No. 1 overall draft pick John Wall had 12 with 12 assists as the Wizards shot 50.6 percent but continued to struggle on the defensive end. Arenas, the subject of trade rumors, had 14 points and six assists off the bench. He's averaged 29.1 points in 12 career games against the Lakers but has not faced them since February 2007.
