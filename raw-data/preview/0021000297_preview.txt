Warriors-Thunder Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Dec 04 2010 3:09PM After missing the last two games, Kevin Durant may return from a knee injury in time to face one of his favorite opponents. Durant could be back in the lineup Sunday when the Oklahoma City Thunder host the Golden State Warriors, who've often been unable to contain the NBA's leading scorer. The Thunder (13-7) were 3-0 this season without Durant in the lineup before suffering a 111-99 loss at Toronto on Friday. Durant, who is averaging 27.3 points, was out with a sprained left knee for a second straight game after missing a 123-120 triple-overtime win at New Jersey on Wednesday. "That's 30 points a night," said James Harden. "We're capable of winning without him but we have to get stops. It's that much more pressure on us to get stops. We were ready for it, we just didn't do it." Against the Raptors, Oklahoma City led by seven at halftime, but was outscored 34-18 in the third quarter. Toronto outrebounded the Thunder 42-34. Coach Scott Brooks said Durant could return Sunday. The team lists him as day to day. "Hopefully he gets better quickly and comes back Sunday," Brooks said. "We'll see how he feels and evaluate him before the game." Durant's return could come against a team he has dominated. Last season, Durant averaged 35.5 points and 9.5 rebounds in four games against the Warriors, three of which Oklahoma City won. In his career against them, he's averaging 30.5 points - his highest against any opponent - while scoring at least 40 points in four of the 11 meetings. If Durant isn't ready to go, the Thunder may need a better performance from Russell Westbrook, who scored 20 points on 9-of-19 shooting against the Raptors after averaging 32.3 points in the previous four games. Oklahoma City may not need Durant to beat struggling Golden State (8-11), which has dropped seven of eight and is looking to avoid a third straight loss after falling 107-101 to Phoenix on Thursday. The Warriors were outscored 31-20 in the first quarter and went 10 of 17 at the free-throw line, where the Suns were 21 of 22. Monta Ellis scored 38 points and David Lee added 25, but Stephen Curry, who is averaging 20.1 points, was held to nine on 4-of-10 shooting. He missed time in the first half when he was poked in the eye. "That slowed me down," said Curry, who had 32 points in Tuesday's 118-98 loss to San Antonio. "I was initiating the offense well and getting people involved. It just took me a while to get back." The offense stalled while Curry was out as depth continues to be a problem for Golden State. The Warriors' bench was outscored 33-15. The good news for Golden State is that Lee played his best game since missing eight contests with a staph infection in his left elbow. Lee, who was averaging 14.3 points before the injury, shot 10 of 17 from the field, had eight rebounds and five assists and played a season-high 45 minutes. The Warriors have lost their last three visits to Oklahoma City. They have given up 107.7 points per game in those contests while scoring 97.3. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
