Based on the way these teams have started this season, getting the best of the Bucks for one night might not be as difficult for the Hawks this time. The Hawks look to avoid a third straight loss and continue their recent home dominance over the Bucks on Wednesday night. Atlanta earned the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs last season, but needed seven games to beat Milwaukee to reach the second round. "We made it a tough series," Bucks swingman Carlos Delfino said. "To go seven games, I think we did pretty good." The Hawks held the Bucks to 85.8 points per game on 39.8-percent shooting while going 3-1 at home in that series. Atlanta also has a six-game regular-season home winning streak over Milwaukee (3-5), which is 1-3 on the road this season. After opening this season with six straight wins, the Hawks (6-2) lost 118-114 at home to Phoenix on Sunday and 93-89 at Orlando the next night. Their latest defeat against the division rival that swept them out of the playoffs in the second round is one first-year coach Larry Drew hopes his team can learn from. "As I told our guys, 'Let's not look at this loss as a moral victory,"' Drew said. "We've always felt in our hearts all along that we were capable of playing against any team." Joe Johnson had 23 points against the Magic and has totaled 57 on 24-of-42 shooting the last two games. He's averaged 26.8 points in his last five regular season contests versus Milwaukee. The Bucks try a third time to win back-to-back games this season after beating New York 107-80 at home Tuesday. Milwaukee, which ranks near the bottom of the league averaging 91.8 points, topped 100 for the second time while shooting a season-high 51.3 percent against the Knicks. "We've been struggling as a team and it was important for us to come out and get a win," Bucks center Andrew Bogut said. Brandon Jennings had 19 points and Drew Gooden added 17 for the Bucks, who led 41-19 after the first quarter. Jennings has struggled early after getting off to a stellar start during his 2009-10 rookie season. The 21-year-old point guard has averaged 14.9 points this season compared to the 25.5 through his first eight games last season. "I felt like I had to be a little more aggressive," said Jennings, who averaged 20.8 points on the road against Atlanta during the playoffs. Bogut missed the playoffs last season with an elbow injury but has not been much of an offensive factor in his last three games against the Hawks, averaging 10.7 points. However, the 7-footer has averaged 14.7 points and 12.7 boards on the road this season. Milwaukee could be without Delfino (12.9 ppg) for a second straight game because of a neck strain.
