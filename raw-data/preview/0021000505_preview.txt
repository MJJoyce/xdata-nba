Bucks-Heat Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Jan 03 2011 11:40PM The success the Miami Heat enjoyed at the end of 2010 has carried over into the new year. Coming off their 11th straight road win, the surging Heat return home looking to extend their overall winning streak to seven games Tuesday night against the Milwaukee Bucks. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra had concerns his club might become complacent during its current run. The Heat almost proved him right after they trailed by seven points in the second quarter before taking over en route to a 96-82 win at Charlotte on Monday. The Heat (27-9) have won 18 of 19, but still trail Boston by one-half game for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. LeBron James matched a season high with 38 points while Dwyane Wade added 31 with 11 rebounds as the Heat shot 48.7 percent and outscored the Bobcats 73-54 after the first quarter. It was the first time the superstars each topped 30 points in the same game this season. "I think we do a good job of playing off each other," said Wade, averaging 35.3 points on 54.4 percent shooting the last four games. "This is what we envisioned and it's starting to come true." While Wade (24.7 points per game) and James (24.8 ppg) have paced the Heat offensively, Miami collectively has held its opponents to 89.8 points per contest over the last 19 games. "We're having a blast," James said. "We're having a good time. We're playing good basketball." Miami held the Bucks (13-18) to one of their lowest-scoring efforts this season in an 88-78 win at Milwaukee on Dec. 6. Wade, who starred at nearby Marquette, had 25 points with 14 rebounds. Though Miami will try for a third straight win overall against the Bucks, it has dropped two straight and four of six at home to Milwaukee. The Bucks are 5-11 on the road, but two of those wins have come in their last three away from the Bradley Center. Milwaukee, however, avoided a third straight overall loss with a 99-87 New Year's Day home win over a Dallas team without injured star Dirk Nowitzki. After shooting 34.6 percent in losses to Atlanta and Chicago, the Bucks shot 49.4 percent and scored its most points in eight games against the Mavericks. "In 2011 we're doing alright right now," forward Corey Maggette told the Bucks' official website. "Hopefully we can keep going, we have a few tough games ahead of us. Hopefully we play hard and shoot the ball well." Five-foot-5 veteran Earl Boykins returned after a one-game suspension to score a season-high 26 points. The 34-year-old Boykins has averaged 20.0 points on 30-of-56 shooting the last four games while star guard Brandon Jennings remains out after undergoing surgery for a stress fracture in his left foot Dec. 20. "Earl's been coming in and putting up tremendous numbers for this team and really holding the fort down, because our star point guard is out," said Maggette, who had 20 points against the Heat last month. "Earl is doing a terrific job, just coming in and holding us afloat." Former Miami Hurricane John Salmons, who scored 21 against the Mavericks, has averaged 21.3 points in his last three games at AmericanAirlines Arena. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
