They also could have trouble with one of the league's top offenses in their next matchup. The 76ers will try to head into the All-Star break on a positive note as they look to beat the Houston Rockets for the sixth time in seven games on Wednesday night. After recording a season-low 10 points and trailing by 16 after one quarter on Tuesday at Memphis, Philadelphia (26-29) failed to extend its winning streak to three games after losing 102-91. "They just rocked us in the first quarter and got us on our heels," coach Doug Collins said. "They did anything they wanted to." The 76ers, who are seventh in the Eastern Conference, have lost 17 of 18 - including six straight - when allowing at least 100 points. Philadelphia trails sixth-place New York by two games and has a one-game edge over Indiana for the final playoff spot in the East. The 76ers will now face a Rockets team tied for third in the NBA with 105.1 points per game. Andre Iguodala's recent offensive woes continued versus the Grizzlies, as he finished with nine points on 2-of-7 shooting and is averaging 10.3 points on 22.6 percent from the floor in his last three games. However, Iguodala is averaging 21.5 points while shooting 54.4 percent in his last four matchups with Houston. Reserve Thaddeus Young scored 23 points against Memphis, and is averaging 18.3 points while shooting 58.2 percent in his last four road games. Although they were outscored 32-19 in the first quarter Monday against Denver, the Rockets (26-30) went on to record their second-highest scoring output since the new year with a 121-102 victory as seven players scored in double figures. Courtney Lee came off the bench and matched a career best with five 3-pointers en route to a team-high 22 points. "We started off a little slow, our shots weren't falling, so we just wanted to get out there, get stops and attack," said Lee. "When we started doing that, we started having fun. When you're having fun, shots start falling and things start going your way." Lee is averaging 18.0 points - 10.6 above his season mark - in his last three games and received high praise from coach Rick Adelman. "He's been very aggressive, I think he's been very active running the floor," said Adelman. "His energy level has been really high and it's really helped us in a lot of games." Aaron Brooks also came up big against the Nuggets with 18 points. He went 6-of-11 from beyond the arc and matched the second-highest scoring output of his career with 34 points in a 102-95 loss at Philadelphia on Feb. 6, 2010. Houston, which is averaging 109.8 points over its last four games, has been held to just 95.8 while losing five of six to the 76ers. The Rockets have also fallen in four of five versus Philadelphia at home, with all the losses coming by seven points or less. Kevin Martin, who leads Houston with 23.2 points per contest, is averaging 15.0 on 34.6 percent shooting in his last two games. Martin is averaging 17.3 points in seven career games versus Philadelphia, but all those contests came while playing with Sacramento. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
