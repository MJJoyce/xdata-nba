Jazz-76ers Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 22 2011 12:33AM Following defeats in what seemed to be very winnable back-to-back road games, the Philadelphia 76ers might normally have a hard time bouncing back versus a team they've stumbled against in recent years. The Utah Jazz, though, haven't been able to come away with a victory so far on a five-game road trip. The 76ers on Saturday night will try to snap a six-game skid against Utah, which will try to avoid falling to 0-4 on its longest swing of 2010-11. After losing 99-98 in overtime to Orlando on Wednesday, Philadelphia (17-25) took a one-point lead over Charlotte with 1:52 to play after trailing for most of the game. However, the 76ers went on to lose their fifth straight road game, 100-97 on Thursday. "We always do a good job of fighting back, but late in games we've got to know how to close out games," Philadelphia's Andre Iguodala said. Elton Brand recorded his team-leading 16th double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds. Thaddeus Young scored 21 off the bench, and could be in line for another big game versus the Jazz, who he's averaging 18.0 points against on 61.5 percent shooting from the floor in his last three meetings. Philadelphia has gone 2-9 in games decided by four points or less, with three losses coming in its last six contests. While the 76ers have kept games close lately, they haven't been able to do so against the Jazz, losing six in a row by an average of 14.5 points. Philadelphia, though, has taken 11 of its last 14 at home while holding opponents to an average of 91.5 points over that span. The 76ers could pose a tough test for a Utah team coming off one of its worst offensive performances of the season. Utah (27-16) fell 110-86 to Boston on Friday, and has allowed an average of 107.0 points during a season-high three-game skid. The Jazz haven't lost four in a row since Jan. 21-27, 2009. Deron Williams - who leads the Jazz with 21.7 points per game - was held to a season-low five after getting into early foul trouble. That ended a career-high string of 48 straight regular-season games with double-digit scoring. "I didn't have a rhythm early. Two quick fouls - two quick calls, I should say - took me out of my game and I really couldn't recover," Williams said. However, he could bounce back in this game as Williams is averaging 27.0 points while shooting 65.6 percent from the floor, including 8 of 10 from 3-point range, in his last two meetings with the 76ers. Williams also recorded 15 points with 20 assists - one short of his career-high - in a 110-107 win over Philadelphia on Jan. 2, 2008 in Utah. The Jazz's Al Jefferson had averaged 23.0 points in his two previous games before finishing with seven on a season-worst 1-of-11 shooting effort Friday against his former club. In seven career games in Philadelphia, Jefferson is averaging 11.3 points and 7.5 rebounds. Philadelphia forward Andres Nocioni has missed the last three games with a broken finger and his status for this game is unknown. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
