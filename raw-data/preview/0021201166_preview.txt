Bucks-Magic Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Apr 10 2013 1:05AM J.J. Redick has not been much of a factor for the Milwaukee Bucks of late. Perhaps a return to Orlando will get him back on track and help his current team end its road struggles overall and against his former squad. Back in Orlando for the first time since being traded to Milwaukee in February, Redick looks to help the Bucks avoid a seventh consecutive road defeat and end a 13-game slide on the Magic's home floor Wednesday night. Redick was averaging a career-high 15.1 points through 50 games of his seventh season with Orlando (19-59) before the Magic traded him to Milwaukee in a six-player deal Feb. 21. "Hopefully he gets a great standing ovation. He deserves it," Orlando guard Jameer Nelson told the Magic's official website. "He gave his heart and soul and blood, sweat and tears and all of that good stuff to the organization and to the fans. He's a guy who contributed to a lot of good years here and left a mark as a professional." Though Redick is headed to the playoffs with the Bucks (37-40), he's averaging 11.9 points and shooting just 41.6 percent in 23 games off the bench for his new team. He was held to four points on 1-of-5 shooting in Milwaukee's 115-109 home win over Orlando on March 17. Redick went 2 of 9 from the field and finished with six points and four assists in 25 minutes of Tuesday's 94-83 loss at Miami. Brandon Jennings scored 30 on 10-of-16 shooting but the Bucks could not stop a Heat team minus Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in a likely first-round playoff preview. Miami missed 15 consecutive 3-point attempts during one stretch and allowed Milwaukee to score 22 points off turnovers, but still extended the Bucks' longest road skid since they started 0-8 away from the Bradley Center last season. "(The Heat) didn't play very well and they still won by a lot," Milwaukee's Mike Dunleavy said. "So it's not the best result for the Bucks." It's not been pretty while the Bucks have dropped 13 straight at Orlando by an average of 14.3 points. The slide is Milwaukee's longest on the road against any opponent. If the Bucks can find a way to end their troubles in Orlando, it would mark their first season sweep of the Magic since 2000-01. Milwaukee guard Monta Ellis has shot 34.5 percent in the last four games and was held to eight points at Miami. However, he's averaged 30.3 points on 52.0 percent shooting and 8.2 assists in his last six games versus Orlando. He scored a season-high 39 and went 13 of 22 from field, including 5 of 6 from 3-point range, against the Magic last month. Orlando returns home from an 0-5 trip as the last two were decided by a total of seven points. Tobias Harris, who came over in the Redick trade, had 26 points and 12 rebounds in the Magic's 91-85 loss to Cleveland on Sunday. The Magic have dropped 13 of 14, but the 6-foot-8 Harris appears to be a building block for the future. He has averaged 16.3 points and 8.4 rebounds in the 23 games he's played since the trade, and scored 14 at Milwaukee last month. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
