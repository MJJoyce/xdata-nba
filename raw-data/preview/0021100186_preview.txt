Bucks-76ers Preview By MATT BECKER Posted Jan 15 2012 11:23PM The Philadelphia 76ers are off to their best start in more than a decade thanks to a perfect record at the Wells Fargo Center. That mark doesn't seem to be in much danger with a game against the Milwaukee Bucks. The 76ers look to improve to 6-0 at home Monday afternoon against the Bucks, who are trying to avoid opening a season with eight straight road losses for the first time in 35 years. Philadelphia (9-3), off to its best start since opening 10-0 in 2000-01 - the season of its last NBA finals appearance - is winning with defense, unselfish play and its ability to protect the ball. The Sixers, who are averaging an NBA-low 12.5 turnovers, matched a season best with eight turnovers in Saturday's 103-90 win over Washington to sweep a home-and-home set. Louis Williams had a team-best 24 points while Andre Iguodala added 23 for Philadelphia, which has seven players with scoring averages in double digits. "We don't have a superstar," said Iguodala, who is averaging 14.3 points. "So we don't get those foul calls, the whistles as much as the teams that do have one. So we have to do the little things right." The Sixers are also doing plenty right on the defensive end. They lead the NBA in field-goal percentage (40.1) allowed and rank second in scoring defense (86.2 ppg). Philadelphia's defense has been particularly outstanding at the Wells Fargo Center, where it has won its first five home games by an average of 25.2 points. The Sixers are limiting visitors to 79.0 points per game, 37.6 percent shooting overall and 18.3 percent from 3-point range. None of that bodes well for Milwaukee (4-7), which has dropped six of its last seven in Philadelphia including both visits last season as the teams split their four-game overall series. Making matters worse for the Bucks, who are undefeated at home, is the fact they're an NBA-worst 0-7 on the road. "We've been very energetic at home, but we board the plane and we're half-asleep out there," coach Scott Skiles said after Friday's 102-76 loss in Dallas. The offense can't seem to get in gear away from Milwaukee, averaging 87.0 points on 39.9 percent shooting. The Bucks, who are 0-7 on the road for the first time since 2004, haven't opened a season with eight straight road losses since dropping their first 16 in 1976-77. "We've got to get a least one road win. Geez." said Brandon Jennings, who is averaging a team-best 18.7 points. Jennings has been a prime offender on the road. He's averaging 22.0 points on 54.4 percent shooting at the Bradley Center, versus 16.9 points per game on 39.5 percent shooting away from Milwaukee. The struggling Bucks could receive a lift from Andrew Bogut, who is expected to play after sitting out against the Mavericks. The seven-foot center, averaging 13.5 points and a team-high 9.2 rebounds, failed a pregame check for concussion symptoms after hitting the back of his head on the floor during Thursday's victory over Detroit. Bogut's presence on the court usually indicates good things for the Bucks, who are 4-2 when he plays but have lost all five games he has missed. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
