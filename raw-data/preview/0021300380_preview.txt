Pelicans-Clippers Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Dec 18 2013 10:22AM The Los Angeles Clippers don't seem to have much trouble scoring at home. That seems likely to continue against the New Orleans Pelicans. The Clippers look to build on perhaps their best performance of the season Wednesday night when they try to send the Pelicans to an 0-3 start to their road trip. Los Angeles (17-9) leads the NBA with an average of 111.5 points at home, winning nine of 11 games. That's in stark contrast to the 98.7 points the Clippers average on the road. They continued their offensive prowess at Staples Center on Monday by beating usually stingy San Antonio 115-92, shooting 51.3 percent from the floor - 11 of 23 from beyond the arc. "It tells you they're in it mentally," coach Doc Rivers said of the Clippers recording their most lopsided win over the Spurs. "Very proud of them. I think they wanted to win very bad." Los Angeles could be in for another productive day on their own court since the Pelicans (11-12) are among the worst defensive teams on the road, surrendering an average of 106.5 points while going 4-7. The Clippers have won five of six against New Orleans, including three in a row. They won for the fourth time in five home meetings Dec. 19, 2012, holding the Pelicans to 38.7 percent from the floor - 2 for 19 from long range - in a 93-77 victory. Blake Griffin will look to capitalize on the defensively porous Pelicans after scoring 27 points - his highest total in 13 games - on 8-of-14 shooting with nine rebounds Monday. That was a welcome change after the All-Star forward averaged 17.1 points and 8.7 boards while shooting 44.2 percent during the Clippers' 4-3 road trip. Chris Paul is also looking to build on a strong performance after tallying 23 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and four steals Monday. The star guard is averaging 22.0 points and 10.8 assists in four home meetings with New Orleans, the club he spent his first six seasons with before being dealt to Los Angeles. The Pelicans opened this five-game road trip with a 102-93 loss at Denver on Sunday, and followed that up by losing 104-93 to Golden State two nights later. "Just a bad game from the start," coach Monty Williams said of Tuesday's defeat, which included an 18-point halftime deficit. New Orleans could use a better performance from the floor after making just 37.5 percent Tuesday, including 5 of 18 from 3-point range. The team wasn't much better from long range against the Nuggets, going 7 for 24. Having Tyreke Evans back would help. A sprained ankle has sidelined the guard for two games, but it's unclear when he'll return. He averages 19.0 points in 10 meetings with the Clippers. Ryan Anderson is averaging 28.5 points over the past four road games, but he was limited to 21 while going 6 for 16 from the field against the Warriors. He could be in for an even stiffer test with a likely matchup against Griffin. Anderson was held to 12.3 points per game on 31.5 percent from the field - 7 for 29 from 3-point range - in four meetings with the Clippers last season.
