So would Love, but he's unsure that a strained left groin will allow that. The Timberwolves will try to snap a season-worst 10-game losing streak Tuesday night when they face a New Jersey Nets team looking to avoid a season-high fifth straight home loss. With five games left, Minnesota (17-60) has already clinched at least a share of the Western Conference's worst record and will finish out of the postseason for the seventh consecutive year. Love has been a bright spot for the lowly Timberwolves, averaging career highs of 20.2 points and a league-best 15.2 rebounds. He also posted 53 consecutive double-doubles from Nov. 22-March 11 in the league's longest such streak since 1973-74. Love, though, has missed four of the last six games with an injured groin. It's uncertain if he'll be back Tuesday, or at all this season. "I can only speak for myself - I like to play. It doesn't matter what the circumstance is," said Rambis, whose team last dropped 11 straight during a franchise record-tying 16-game skid Feb. 24-March 28, 2010. "It's going to be a long summer, potentially even longer (with the collective bargaining agreement expiring at the end of this season)." If Love can't go, Minnesota may have caught a break with Nets leading rebounder Kris Humphries expected to miss his third consecutive game with a sprained right ankle and bruised heel. Without the Minneapolis native in the lineup, the Nets (23-53) were outrebounded 50-30 in Sunday's 108-94 loss to Miami Coach Avery Johnson said Travis Outlaw provided a "good spark for us off the bench" with 17 points and nine rebounds, so he could be in the starting lineup Tuesday after Brandan Wright was ineffective in his first start since being acquired from Golden State on Feb. 23. Whoever starts will try to help the Nets snap a six-game overall skid and an 0-4 stretch in New Jersey. The last time the Nets dropped five in a row at home was a franchise-worst 0-14 slide Jan. 29-March 22, 2010. Minnesota, a conference-worst 5-33 on the road, snapped a four-game losing streak in New Jersey in its last visit, a 103-99 victory Dec. 23, 2009. The Timberwolves posted their fourth consecutive victory in this series and eighth in a row at home Jan. 1, winning 103-88. Minnesota is allowing 107.7 points per game during its losing streak, but New Jersey is scoring 93.2 during a 1-10 slump. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
