The 76ers will try to snap a four-game slide when they take on a Raptors team looking to avoid a third consecutive loss Wednesday night at the Wells Fargo Center. Philadelphia (2-9) kicked off its five-game road trip with a win over New York on Nov. 7, but couldn't find another victory before heading back home. The 76ers entered the second half tied with Cleveland on Tuesday night but were outscored 26-16 in the third quarter en route to a 101-93 loss. Thaddeus Young matched a season high with 17 points off the bench and rookie Evan Turner had 16 after being held scoreless in a 116-93 loss to San Antonio on Saturday. Philadelphia also played without Andre Iguodala for the third time in five games. The swingman, averaging 12.8 points and 5.6 rebounds, has been bothered by an ailing Achilles' tendon. His status is unknown for the 76ers' attempt to earn just their 10th victory in 43 games dating back to Feb. 10, and their fourth in 19 at Philadelphia. Iguodala scored a season-high 33 points in a 128-123 overtime loss to Toronto on April 9, and had averaged 20.9 points in his last seven home games versus the Raptors. "We lose a big weapon when Andre doesn't play," coach Doug Collins said. "Without him, we lose his quickness. That's a huge loss." The Raptors, meanwhile, will likely be without top reserve Leandro Barbosa. The guard missed his fourth straight game Tuesday because of a strained left shoulder. Toronto coach Jay Triano said he hopes Barbosa can return as soon as this weekend. Without him, Toronto (2-9) managed to upset Orlando on Friday to start its current four-game road trip, which ends Wednesday. The Raptors, though, have given up 109 points in each of its last two games. They were outscored 36-21 in the third quarter during Tuesday night's 109-94 loss to Washington, which had previously won two games this season. Andrea Bargnani was a season-worst 3 for 13 from the floor during his team's 40 percent shooting performance. "We all have to be better. Every single guy has to be better," Triano said. "I even start to question where we are. ... It was surprising to see our team come out so flat." Triano's team, 1-6 on the road, has won seven of nine in Philadelphia and four of five overall against its Atlantic Division rivals. Bargnani has averaged 22.3 points in his last three trips to Wells Fargo. Young, meanwhile, has averaged 23.5 points on 55.4 percent shooting in his last four games against Toronto.
