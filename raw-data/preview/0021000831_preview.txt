The veteran swingman looks to further contribute for his new team while trying to help the Mavericks continue their recent dominance of the visiting Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. Dallas (38-16) signed the veteran on Jan. 24, but he didn't make his debut until Feb. 7 in a win over Cleveland. After totaling 14 points over the first three games with his new club, the 33-year-old scored 22 on 8 of 12 shooting in Saturday's 106-102 win at Houston. A sore left knee has limited Stojakovic to those four games since Nov. 28. Toronto didn't see the three-time All-Star in its future plans, but the Mavericks hope he can help maintain their success while filling the void after Caron Butler suffered a knee injury that could sideline him the entire season. Stojakovic hit four 3-pointers against the Rockets to pass Dale Ellis for fourth on the NBA's all-time list with 1,723. "That's an added dimension that we've been missing, and it just makes us deeper and stronger," said teammate Jason Kidd, who is third with 1,756 3-pointers. Second in the Western Conference, Dallas is 7 1/2 games behind first-place San Antonio. Though the Mavericks might have a hard time catching the Spurs, they have a good chance to solidify the No. 2 spot if Stojakovic can continue to become a viable option. "It is easy to play with the guys," Stojakovic said. "I get so many good looks because they draw so much attention." Dallas has averaged 106.3 points and shot 49.0 percent while winning 10 of 11. The Mavericks are 27-2 when scoring at least 100 points in 2010-11. The Mavericks have averaged 114.6 points on 51.7 percent shooting during a 13-game home winning streak over Sacramento (13-39) that dates to a 126-124 loss Feb. 27, 2003. Looking to match a season high with a seventh consecutive home win, the Mavericks have put up 109.8 points per contest while winning eight straight overall against the Kings. Stojakovic, who spent his first 7 1/2 seasons with the Kings, had just four points on 1 of 7 shooting in Dallas' 102-100 win at Sacramento last Wednesday. Reserve guard Jason Terry and J.J. Barea combined for 42 points on 15 of 24 shooting to pace the Mavericks. Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki was held to 10 points while dealing with a sore wrist in that contest. However, he scored 22 against Houston and finished with 31 and 12 rebounds in a 108-100 win over the Kings in the teams' last meeting in Dallas on March 5. Sacramento's Tyreke Evans scored 20 in that contest, and has totaled 49 points and gone 22 of 36 from the field in two career games at Dallas. The Kings hope that success continues as Evans is expected to return after missing Tuesday's 126-96 loss at Oklahoma City with plantar fasciitis. The second-year guard has averaged 22.2 points in six games this month. Evans hopes to join rookie DeMarcus Cousins after he posted 21 points and 13 rebounds Tuesday in his return from a one-game suspension for fighting with teammate Donte Greene following Saturday's home loss to the Thunder. Cousins scored 19 with 15 boards against the Mavericks last week. Sacramento has lost six of seven. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
