Raptors-Wizards Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Nov 15 2010 1:26PM John Wall has been living up to the hype of being the No. 1 overall draft pick, bringing excitement to a struggling Washington Wizards franchise while leading all rookies in scoring. However, after Wall injured his left foot in his last game, the Wizards may be without their young star when they host the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday night. After winning 45 games over the last two seasons, Washington (2-6) isn't off to a much better start in 2010-11. The Wizards, though, are excited about Wall, who is averaging team highs of 18.1 points and 9.8 assists to go along with 4.0 rebounds. He has four double-doubles and posted a triple-double in a 98-91 win over Houston last Wednesday. Wall, however, was wearing a walking boot after a 103-96 loss to Chicago on Saturday. He suffered the injury in the third quarter and returned in the fourth, but could be sidelined for a few games. "It's swollen a little bit," he said. "I sprained it. I just got to take some days off and get treatment on it." Coach Flip Saunders said he would take a wait-and-see approach with Wall for Tuesday. Forward Yi Jianlian could also be out with a bruised right knee he suffered Saturday. Washington did get an encouraging performance from Gilbert Arenas, who scored a season-high 30 points on 11-of-22 shooting and made seven of 10 3-pointers. The guard, who was dealing with an ankle injury at the start of the season, had totaled 10 points in his previous two games while going 3 of 21 from the field. Arenas should be happy to be facing Toronto. He averaged 28.0 points in two meetings in 2009-10 before being suspended the final 50 games for bringing guns into the locker room. The Raptors (2-8) continue their four-game road trip Tuesday after splitting the first two games. Toronto surprised Orlando 110-106 on Friday before losing 109-100 to former teammate Chris Bosh and Miami the next night. Andrea Bargnani had 22 points and nine rebounds while DeMar DeRozan added 21 points to keep it close against the Heat. Miami shot 50.6 percent and led throughout. "We know people are going to think, 'Oh we're playing the Raptors,' and OK, our record is not as good as it should be, but we're going to play hard for 48 minutes," said point guard Jose Calderon, who had a season-high 15 points. "And we're going to give teams a hard time. ... We're a better team than our record says." The Raptors, though, continue to struggle defensively, giving up at least 100 points in four straight games. Opponents are averaging 104.5 points and shooting 48.3 percent against them - both among the worst marks in the league. Washington lost two of three to Toronto last season, falling in 109-107 in overtime in the one game at the Verizon Center. That was the Wizards' third consecutive home loss to the Raptors, which have come by a combined nine points. Four of the teams' last eight meetings in Washington have gone to overtime.
