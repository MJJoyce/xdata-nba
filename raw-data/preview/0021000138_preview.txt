The Spurs (6-1) will look for their seventh consecutive home victory against the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night at the AT&T Center. Since 1986-87, the Spurs are third in the NBA with 712 home wins, and are 22-1 against the 76ers in San Antonio, holding them to 91.5 points per game. The Spurs improved to 3-1 at home this season following a 107-95 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday. Richard Jefferson and Manu Ginobili led the way with 22 points apiece and combined to go 7 for 12 from 3-point range. Two nights earlier, Jefferson missed all three of his 3-pointers, and scored a season-low six in a 95-91 win at Charlotte. "I had some good looks the other night and the team has been off to a hot start shooting," Jefferson said. "Tonight I just wanted to come out and be aggressive and not let one game affect my mentality. I want to show that this is the way we're going to play all season." After shooting 35.8 percent from beyond the arc in 2009-10, San Antonio is connecting on an NBA-best 42.5 percent this season. However, the Spurs could struggle from long distance against Philadelphia, which has limited opponents to 20.6 percent in its last four games. Tim Duncan, who is averaging a career-low 15.4 points, experienced flu-like symptoms prior to Wednesday's game and scored a season-low six points The 12-time All-Star and two-time MVP could bounce back against the 76ers. He's averaging 21.8 points in 25 games when facing them. Tony Parker leads the Spurs with 8.4 assists per game and knows they can't afford to overlook the struggling 76ers (2-7). "(Jrue Holiday) is a pretty good point guard, talented, he's young, so I'm definitely going to have to match his energy," Parker said. "He's been solid." Holiday scored 11 points and matched a season-high with 13 assists in Philadelphia's 99-90 loss in Dallas on Friday. "Their size killed us. At the end of the day, it was their size," said 76ers coach Doug Collins, whose team allowed a season worst-tying 16 offensive rebounds. Andre Iguodala, who has led the 76ers in scoring each of the previous four seasons, had 13 points and seven rebounds after missing two games with a strained right Achilles' tendon. Iguodala is averaging 23.0 points in his last four contests in San Antonio. Elton Brand, who leads Philadelphia with 17.2 points per game, was held to a season-low eight against the Mavericks. He's averaged 17.7 points with 12 double-doubles against the Spurs over his career. San Antonio is averaging 110.8 points at home - up from 101.3 on the road. The Spurs will likely miss the presence of James Anderson, who has connected on 10 of 20 three-pointers this season. San Antonio's 2010 first-round pick from Oklahoma State is expected to miss up to six weeks with a stress fracture in his right foot. Not one player remains from the Philadelphia roster that triumphed in San Antonio 83-77 on Jan. 3, 2004 - its only win on the Spurs' home court in the last 24 seasons.
