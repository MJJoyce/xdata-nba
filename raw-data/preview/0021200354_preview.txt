Spurs-Thunder Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Dec 16 2012 10:25PM Thanks to their longest winning streak in 16 years, the Oklahoma City Thunder own the best record in the NBA. The San Antonio Spurs aren't far behind and Tony Parker is a big reason why. Kevin Durant and the Thunder go for their 11th win in a row Monday night when they host Parker and the Spurs for the first time since eliminating them in last season's Western Conference finals. Oklahoma City (19-4) has won 10 straight for the first time since an 11-game run in November 1996 when the franchise was the Seattle SuperSonics. The Thunder are averaging 109.6 points and shooting 50.2 percent during the current streak, keeping them perfect since a loss at Boston on Nov. 23. "It's good. We're 19-4 and we just want to look at the bigger picture instead of winning streaks," said sixth man Kevin Martin, who is averaging 19.7 points in the past three games. "We're a pretty talented team, so we're just taking baby steps and getting better every day." Durant continues to be the team's driving force, averaging 30.2 points over his last 12 games, with Oklahoma City winning 11. The superstar forward kept the Thunder rolling Friday, making 10 of 14 field goals to finish with 31 points and four steals in Friday's 113-103 win over Sacramento. Durant had 23 points, 14 rebounds and five assists in an 86-84 loss at San Antonio (19-6) in the Thunder's season opener Nov. 1. He's averaged 25.8 points in 18 career regular-season meetings with the Spurs, but totaled 29.5 while helping top-seeded Oklahoma City oust San Antonio in the conference finals last spring. Durant was stellar in the decisive 107-99 victory in Game 6 on June 6, tallying 34 points, 14 rebounds and five assists. Parker finished with 29 points and 12 assists in that meeting, and had 14 and 11 in this season's first matchup. The four-time All-Star enters this game averaging 22.9 points and 8.0 assists during San Antonio's 6-2 run, and had 22 points with four steals in a 103-88 win over Boston on Saturday. "Tony's a phenomenal player," said guard Gary Neal, who had 20 points. "Through the years I've been here, he's done some phenomenal things." Tim Duncan was far from phenomenal Saturday, missing 11 of 13 shots to finish with a season-low five points and 12 rebounds. He was much better against Oklahoma City last month, collecting 20 points, eight boards and three blocks. Manu Ginobili may miss another meeting with the Thunder after back spasms kept him sidelined for the first matchup. The veteran swingman suffered a bruised left quad in the opening quarter against the Celtics. He averaged 18.5 points against Oklahoma City in the playoffs, but was limited to 10.3 on 37.5 percent shooting in the three road games. While the Spurs and Thunder are back atop the West standings with a burgeoning rivalry, Parker doesn't feel it's on the level as San Antonio's others against Dallas and the Los Angeles Lakers. "No, not yet," he said. "Not like the Lakers or the Mavericks. Sure, it's starting to become a rivalry." Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
