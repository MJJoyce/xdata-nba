Cavaliers-76ers Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Dec 06 2010 1:58PM The Philadelphia 76ers have taken advantage of some struggling opponents recently to move above .500 at the Wells Fargo Center. If they want push their home winning streak to five, they'll have to snap a pair of losing streaks to the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 76ers try to stop an eight-game home skid and five-game overall slide against the Cavs when the teams meet in Philadelphia for the second time this season Tuesday night. Philadelphia (6-14) opened a four-game homestand with a 109-91 win over Charlotte on Saturday, its third victory in four games and fourth in a row at home. Those home victories, all of which came against teams that currently have losing records, pushed the 76ers to 5-4 at the Wells Fargo Center. Cleveland (7-13) is also struggling in the early going, but the Cavs have had little trouble against the 76ers recently, winning 14 of 17 meetings. Cleveland pushed its road run versus Philadelphia to eight with a 123-116 victory Nov. 5. The 76ers, though, are trying to win five straight at home for the first time since an eight-game run Feb. 5-March 7, 2008. Plus, they're facing a Cavs team that has lost a season-high four in a row by an average of 22.8 points, and has dropped six consecutive road games by 16.2 a contest. Jodie Meeks helped give the Sixers a winning record at home Saturday, scoring 20 of his 26 points in the first quarter of a 109-91 victory over Charlotte. The second-year guard made his first career start Friday against Atlanta. He's averaging 8.8 points in 2010-11. "This league is all about your opportunity," Meeks said. "I tried to do as much as I could early in the season, kept getting better and kept getting better. Now it's paying off." Meeks started both games in place of rookie Evan Turner, who's averaging 7.5 points while shooting 41.6 percent. Cleveland is coming off a 102-92 road defeat to last-place Detroit on Sunday. Antawn Jamison led five Cavs in double figures with 22 points and went 8 of 17 from the field, but his teammates shot 40.3 percent. Cleveland had lost its previous two games by a combined 62 points. The Cavs managed to lead the Pistons after one quarter and scored 20 points off 15 turnovers. "Obviously, I'm not happy about the loss, but I am a bit happier by the fact that our guys competed out there," coach Byron Scott said. "That's a step in the right direction, but we've got to do it again Tuesday, and do it even harder and even better." Scott's team has shot 38.8 percent over the last three games while averaging 91.0 points. Cleveland may have a tough time getting on track offensively against Philadelphia, which has held its last four opponents to 87.3 points on 40.6 percent from the floor. The Cavs won the second meeting of the season with Sixers 101-93 at Quicken Loans Arena on Nov. 16. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
