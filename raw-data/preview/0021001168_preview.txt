Suns-Timberwolves Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Apr 06 2011 1:48AM A visit to Minnesota presents the Phoenix Suns with an ideal chance to avoid their first five-game road losing streak in over a year. The Timberwolves have a longer slide they'd like to snap. In a meeting between two teams out of playoff contention, the Suns look to beat Minnesota for a seventh consecutive time Wednesday night. After opening a five-game swing with a 17-point loss to league-best San Antonio on Monday, Phoenix (37-40) dropped a 97-94 decision at Eastern Conference-leading Chicago on Tuesday. The Suns last dropped five straight on the road from Jan. 13-25, 2010, and a stop at the Target Center may be what they need to avoid equaling that slide. Phoenix has won 17 of the last 22 meetings with the Timberwolves, including eight of 11 in Minnesota. They ran their winning streak in the series to six with a 128-122 home victory on Dec. 15 behind Steve Nash's 11 points and 19 assists. Nash is averaging 15.5 points and 12.5 assists over the last 11 games at Minnesota. The two-time MVP point guard dished out 16 assists while scoring six points Tuesday after missing the previous two games with flulike symptoms. Vince Carter, who scored 23 points against the Bulls, will face the Timberwolves for the first time with the Suns. He had 20 points and seven assists while helping Orlando to a 128-86 win on Nov. 3. The veteran swingman is averaging 25.3 points in 10 visits to the Target Center. Minnesota, last in the Western Conference, hasn't beaten the Suns since Jan. 16, 2009 and enters this matchup on an 11-game slide - its longest since dropping 16 in a row from Feb. 24-March 28, 2010. Michael Beasley nearly ended the skid Tuesday, but his off-balance 3-point attempt at the buzzer rimmed out in a 107-105 loss at New Jersey. "Obviously I don't want to shoot off balance like that all the time, but once I released it I thought it was going to go in," Beasley said. The forward has scored 20 in each of the last two games, but got all of his points against the Nets in the second half. His production has come with Kevin Love sitting out two games with a groin injury. Love's status for Wednesday isn't clear, potentially leaving the Timberwolves without their top player averaging 20.2 points and 15.2 rebounds per game. The All-Star has totaled 46 points and 38 rebounds over the last two meetings with the Suns. The Suns and Timberwolves will complete their season series Monday in Phoenix.
