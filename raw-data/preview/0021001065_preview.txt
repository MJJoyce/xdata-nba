Wizards-Clippers Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Mar 23 2011 2:05AM Blake Griffin got the best of John Wall in a matchup of the last two overall No. 1 draft picks when the Los Angeles Clippers beat Washington earlier this month. After a rough outing in their last contest, Griffin and the Clippers look to bounce back with a fifth consecutive victory over Wall and the visiting Wizards on Wednesday night. Griffin scored all of his 26 points in the first half of Los Angeles' 122-101 win at Washington on March 12. "Blake Griffin is a phenomenal player," Washington coach Flip Saunders said. Though Los Angeles (27-44) shot 51.8 percent and scored its second-most points of the season against the Wizards, the Clippers have dropped three of four since that contest. Griffin is averaging 22.3 points during his stellar first season after missing all of 2009-10 with a knee injury, but has failed to score more than 17 in three of the last four. He was held to 17 and picked up a technical after fouling out on an offensive call in Sunday's 108-99 loss to Phoenix. "He's such a talented player," teammate Chris Kaman told the Clippers' official website. "He's gifted physically. He's had a monster rookie year. He's prevailing, but (Sunday) he was just frustrated. It was his competitiveness. He's so competitive. He hates losing and he always wants to win." Griffin finished with one more point than Wall, who had 25, eight assists and seven rebounds in their first meeting. Eric Bledsoe, Wall's teammate at Kentucky and the 18th overall pick in 2010, scored a career-high 23 points for Los Angeles at Washington. After totaling 47 points the previous two games, Wall was held to nine with seven assists as Washington (17-52) opened a five-game western trip with a 111-76 loss at Portland on Tuesday. Jordan Crawford scored a team-high 12 points as the Wizards shot 37.1 percent and matched their season low for points. "It was like we weren't even out there," Wall said. Washington is a dreadful 1-32 on the road, where it has lost seven in a row since winning 115-100 at Cleveland on Feb. 13. It has dropped two in a row and five of six at Los Angeles. Giving up 111.0 points per contest during their current road skid, the Wizards continue to struggle without injured starters Andray Blatche, Rashard Lewis and Nick Young. Blatche could miss a seventh straight game with a sprained right shoulder and Lewis his ninth in a row with a sore knee. It's uncertain if Young will miss his fifth straight because of a bruised knee. Crawford has been one of the few bright sports for Washington, averaging 19.3 points the last seven games. He had 16 against the Clippers. Kaman finished with 21 points and 11 rebounds Sunday and might get his second straight start in place of DeAndre Jordan, who could miss his second consecutive contest with a mild case of pneumonia. Kaman's averaged 18.2 points and 10.0 boards his last five home games versus Washington. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
