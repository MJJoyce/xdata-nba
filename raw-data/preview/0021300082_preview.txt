Warriors-Spurs Preview By JORDAN GARRETSON Posted Nov 07 2013 4:50PM The Golden State Warriors haven't won a regular-season game in San Antonio in nearly 17 years. With Stephen Curry's playing status in jeopardy for Friday night's tilt against the Spurs, that drought could continue. The Warriors (4-1) have won back-to-back road games by a combined 33 points following a 106-93 victory at Minnesota on Wednesday, though they finished without Curry. The sharpshooter, who left in the third quarter, has been diagnosed with a left ankle bone bruise and is considered day-to-day. "Just a tough, unfortunate injury, but I've got guys I believe in and our versatility showed," coach Mark Jackson said. "Hopefully Steph will be fine and we continue to march on." Curry has had ankle issues throughout his career, missing as many as 40 games two seasons ago. The Warriors are 16-38 without Curry since he entered the league and 0-4 against the Spurs. But even with Curry, Golden State hasn't been able to win in San Antonio. The Warriors have dropped 29 consecutive regular-season games there - the league's longest active road losing streak against a single opponent. Curry's 12.6 career scoring average in San Antonio is his lowest in any city. Golden State ended a 16-game slide in the series overall last season as each team won two home meetings. The Warriors even knocked off the Spurs at the AT&T Center in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals, but they still haven't won a regular-season game in San Antonio since a 108-94 victory Feb. 14, 1997, when Tim Duncan was a senior at Wake Forest. Klay Thompson stepped up in Curry's absence Wednesday, scoring 19 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter. Curry scored five points on 2-for-8 shooting in 24 minutes. "It just shows that we're not all about Steph," said Thompson, actually ahead of Curry for the team lead with 24.0 points per game. "Steph's one of the best players in the NBA, but sometimes people think we rely on him too much. And it's not fair to him and we're a deep team this year." The Warriors seemed to prove that, at least for one night, as they received 22 points and 15 rebounds from David Lee while Andre Iguodala scored 20. Harrison Barnes had 14 points after missing the first four games due to left toe inflammation. The Spurs (4-1) relied on Tony Parker late in a 99-96 home victory over Phoenix on Wednesday, one night after a 115-105 win in Denver. The Suns held a one-point edge with one minute remaining, but Parker scored 15 of San Antonio's final 16 points, including the go-ahead basket. Parker, who finished with 20 points, leads the team in scoring (19.6 ppg), assists (7.2 apg) and minutes (33.0 mpg). He averaged 22.3 points in eight games against the Warriors last season, including the playoffs. "Tony is someone we depend on," coach Gregg Popovich said. "He plays a lot of minutes. We expect him to be able to give us that offense, distribute the ball and play good `D' night after night after night. He's been doing it for a long time now." Duncan averaged 22.7 points on 53.1 percent shooting with 12.0 rebounds and 3.7 blocks in three regular-season contests versus Golden State in 2012-13. The Spurs are 50-9 against the Warriors in the regular season since he entered the league. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
