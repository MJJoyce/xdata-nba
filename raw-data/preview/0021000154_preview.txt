Trail Blazers-Grizzlies Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Nov 15 2010 11:53PM With or without star Brandon Roy in the lineup, a visit to Memphis could help Portland end its recent rough stretch. It's uncertain if Roy will play Tuesday night when the Trail Blazers look to avoid a third straight loss while trying to continue their road dominance of the Grizzlies, who have lost three in a row. Averaging a team-leading 18.1 points, Roy said last week he would not opt for surgery on his chronically sore left knee and play through the pain. However, that injury limited him to two points on 1-of-7 shooting in 22 minutes of Portland's 107-87 loss at New Orleans on Saturday. "He told me his knee was sore, and he needed to be pulled," Portland coach Nate McMillan said. "He'll be evaluated and we'll wait and see what happens." Even with Roy on the floor, the Trail Blazers (6-5) have lost five of eight since starting 3-0. Portland has a good chance to get back on track as it tries for a 10th win in 12 games against Memphis (4-7). The Trail Blazers have averaged 103.0 points and held the high-scoring Grizzlies to 96.1 per contest during a seven-game winning streak at Memphis. Roy has averaged 21.8 points in six of those contests. In order to continue their success in Memphis, the Blazers likely must play better in the first half after being held to 35 points on 14-of-41 shooting in the first two quarters against the Hornets. "We need to put together 48 minutes of good basketball," said McMillan. Portland's third-year swingman Nicolas Batum continues to put forth a complete effort, averaging 17.8 points on 51.2 percent shooting in his last six contests. He had 21 points in a 103-93 win in the Blazers' last visit to Memphis on March 1. The Grizzlies might have a hard time ending their home struggles against Portland if they play like they did during an 89-72 loss at Orlando on Monday. Memphis entered the game averaging 104.6 points but was held to a season-low 36.3 percent shooting in its lowest scoring game since an 86-66 loss at Portland on March 28, 2009. Rudy Gay (23.7 points per game), who had not scored fewer than 18 points in a game this season, had nine on 4-of-17 shooting Monday. Frontcourt mates Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol combined for 23. The defeat was humbling enough for Memphis to have a team meeting after the game. "We needed to talk. It's never too early to have a team meeting," said guard Mike Conley, who had 11 points and eight assists. "The issues we have as a team, being accountable individually, we've got to step it up and have all the guys in tune." Gay has averaged 15.9 points and shot 51.1 percent during the Grizzlies' home losing streak against Portland. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
