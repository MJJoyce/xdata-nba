Bucks-Hawks Preview By SANTOSH VENKATARAMAN Posted Mar 14 2011 12:56PM The Milwaukee Bucks are looking to put an embarrassing loss behind them while the Atlanta Hawks seem to be searching for a spark. The Bucks look to recover from scoring the fewest points in franchise history when they visit the Hawks on Tuesday night. Milwaukee (26-39) had won three straight by an average of 22.3 points before falling 87-56 at Boston on Sunday. The Bucks, who joined the NBA before the 1968-69 season, had never scored so few points. "The thing is, this is one game, we can't let this snowball, we can't let this affect us going to the next game, we have to put this behind us and prepare for the Hawks," guard Earl Boykins said. The Bucks are last in the NBA in points per game (91.2) and field-goal percentage (42.5). Their 31.4 percent shooting Sunday marked their second-worst performance of the season. "That's about as humiliating a defeat as you'll ever see," coach Scott Skiles said. "They got us on our heels and took our competitive fight away from us. We pretty much just gave into it." Milwaukee is 10th in the Eastern Conference, 1 1/2 games behind Indiana and Charlotte for the eighth and final playoff spot. Atlanta (38-28) is far more secure in fifth place in the East, although it has dropped 10 of 15.  The Hawks ended a four-game skid with a 91-82 win over Portland on Saturday. Joe Johnson's rough stretch continued as he scored 11 points. He's averaging 14.1 points - 4.7 below his season average - on 41.0 percent shooting over the last 15 games. The Hawks overcame his struggles Saturday thanks in part to Jeff Teague, who matched a career high with 24 points. Teague made 11 of 17 shots. "I've never stopped believing in this kid because I see what the package is with him," coach Larry Drew said. "He can make shots. He's got speed. He's got quickness. He can go from end to end. Defensively, he can be a nuisance." The short-handed Hawks were without starting center Al Horford, out with a sprained ankle. Horford's potential absence Tuesday would be a major factor since he has averaged 16.3 points and 9.3 rebounds in three meetings with the Bucks this season. Zaza Pachulia started in his place Saturday and had six points and six boards. In addition, reserve forward Josh Powell was not at Saturday's game. Powell was arrested that day on traffic charges not far from Philips Arena for refusing to move his car for an oncoming ambulance. The Hawks have not commented on Powell's status. Milwaukee has won two of three against Atlanta this season after blowing a 3-2 lead in the first round of the playoffs when these teams met last year. Corey Maggette is averaging 16.0 points on 16-of-21 shooting and Boykins 13.3 points in the 2010-11 series. Johnson averaged 14.3 points on 39.5 percent shooting in those games for the Hawks, well below his 20.9 points per game and 42.3 percent shooting in last year's playoff series.
