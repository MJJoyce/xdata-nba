Clippers-Timberwolves Preview By KEVIN CHROUST Posted Nov 20 2013 1:58AM Chris Paul is after his 12th straight double-double, and the Los Angeles Clippers are after their seventh straight win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Paul will try to orchestrate both for the Clippers Wednesday night in Minnesota. His 18-point, 11-assist effort in Monday's 106-102 loss to Memphis made him the first player since Magic Johnson in 1990-91 to begin a season with 11 straight double-doubles. Paul's career-best streak at any point in a season is 12. Both the Clippers (7-4) and Timberwolves (7-5) are out to avoid losing back-to-back games for the second time this year. The Clippers beat the Timberwolves 109-107 in Los Angeles on Nov. 11 and have won six straight in the series, including four meetings last season. Paul had 21 points and 11 assists in this year's matchup and has double-doubles in three straight against the Timberwolves. After Monday's loss, the Clippers have failed to win a game in which they've scored fewer than 107 points. "They hit first tonight," Clippers coach Doc Rivers told the team's official website. "But in the games we hit first, not physically hit, but established the pace and the way you're going to play, we've won those games. In the games that they've dictated it, they've been close but they've won most of them." The Clippers are scoring a league-best 109.3 points per game and the Timberwolves are third at 107.8. Blake Griffin scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds against the Grizzlies and has at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in eight of his last 10. He said the Clippers are at their best playing up-tempo basketball. "We just kind of fell into that slow grind and that's not going to work for us like we talked about," Griffin said. "We can play that way, but not as well as we can the other way." The Timberwolves haven't minded those kinds of games in their own building. They're 5-1 at home and have averaged 109.8 points in those games despite shooting 44.2 percent from the floor. They're returning home after Tuesday's 104-100 loss at Washington to continue a stretch of five games in seven days. Minnesota had a 16-point lead in the first half but scored just 37 in the final two quarters. "If you're going to be somebody in the league, you have to be ready to win every night," Timberwolves guard Ricky Rubio said. "I think we didn't do it tonight in the second half and this kind of game is one of the games that you're going to need." Kevin Love had 25 points and 11 rebounds for his 11th double-double in 12 games. Sixteen of those points came in the first quarter. Kevin Martin had his worst shooting night of the year, going 4 for 17 with 11 points. He's 10 for 35 in his last two games. "We need everybody every night," coach Rick Adelman said. "We can't usually get by if we have a couple guys with off games." Martin had one of his three 30-point nights this season against the Clippers nine days ago.
