A much improved defense has helped them turn that around. Philadelphia will look to win its fourth straight at home and sweep a season series from the Suns for the first time in nine years Monday night. After road losses to Orlando and Charlotte by a combined four points, the 76ers (18-25) returned home to defeat Utah 96-85 on Saturday night. Philadelphia held the Jazz to 42.0 percent shooting and improved to 13-7 at Wells Fargo Center - surpassing its 12 home victories from 2009-10. "We've been playing strong on the road, we just haven't finished," said Elton Brand, who had 19 points. "There's a lot of pressure on us to come home and win, which we've been doing." Philadelphia allowed 101.4 points per game on its home court last season, but has held opponents to an average of 93.0 in 2010-11 - a total that ranks seventh-best in the league. While defense continues to be their catalyst, the 76ers recorded their highest point total of the season in a 123-110 win at Phoenix on Dec. 29, as seven of only eight active players scored in double figures. Jrue Holiday had 25 points on 12-of-18 shooting. Andre Iguodala scored 22 Saturday and is averaging 20.9 points - 5.1 more than his career average - in his last seven meetings with Phoenix. The Suns (20-22) struggled at both ends of the court late in Saturday's 75-74 loss at Detroit, ending their season-best five-game win streak. They squandered a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, getting outscored 28-13 in the final 12 minutes. "We have to finish games, that's the bottom line," Suns coach Alvin Gentry said. "We have to play for 48 minutes, even though it may be the oldest cliché in the book, you can see what happens when you don't. We had complete control of the game and we just let it slip away." Steve Nash had 14 points and eight assists, snapping his five-game double-double run. He has averaged 22.0 points and 14.5 assists in his last four games against the 76ers, leading his team to three wins. Channing Frye was limited to eight points and shot 2 of 12 from 3-point range Saturday after averaging 18.8 points while making 17 of 33 (51.5 percent) from beyond the arc in his previous five contests. Frye could be in for another long night against a 76ers team that leads the league in opponent 3-point percentage at home (31.4 percent). Gentry's team had averaged 114.7 points on the first three stops of its five-game trip before scoring a season-low 74 against the Pistons. The Suns' 105.2 points per game on the road are the second-most in the NBA. Philadelphia is 1-15 when allowing at least 100 points, with its only win coming at Phoenix. The 76ers haven't swept a season series from the Suns since 2001-02. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
