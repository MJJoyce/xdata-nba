Thunder-Jazz Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Nov 15 2010 2:02AM While the Utah Jazz are pleased with their five-game winning streak, there's little doubt they've left themselves plenty of room for improvement. The Jazz hope for a much smoother road to a sixth consecutive victory Monday night when they host the Oklahoma City Thunder. Utah (7-3) has outscored opponents by only 3.8 points during its five-game streak. That slight margin is partly due to the Jazz needing to rally for all of those victories, overcoming second-half margins as vast as 22 points, which they did in a 116-114 overtime win at Miami on Tuesday. That remarkable streak continued Saturday, as Utah erased a 16-point halftime deficit before Deron Williams hit the winning shot with 0.8 seconds left in a 96-95 victory at Charlotte. "We haven't panicked - we just keep fighting," Williams said. "We know we've still got a chance. When we're down 20, we talked about getting it down to 10. When we got it down to 10, we were like, 'Let's get it going.' So we did." The winning streak is part of a 7-1 run that includes a 120-99 win at Oklahoma City (5-4) on Oct. 31. The Northwest Division rivals haven't met in Salt Lake City since April 6 when Williams scored a career-high 42 points, hitting the deciding jumper with 1.1 seconds left in a stirring 140-139 overtime win. Williams was vital in the most recent matchup with the Thunder, collecting 16 points and a season-high 15 assists. He's also come up big during the current winning streak, averaging 24.4 points and 10.8 assists after getting 17 and nine, respectively, against the Bobcats. Williams is developing strong chemistry with Paul Millsap, who has emerged as Utah's top scorer at 21.9 points per game after Carlos Boozer left in the offseason to join Chicago. The forward had 17 points on 7-for-11 shooting Saturday. Millsap scored 30 points and pulled down a season-high 16 boards at Oklahoma City last month. The Thunder may be in for another rough night defensively after losing 117-104 to San Antonio on Sunday. They're allowing 105.8 points per game to rank 26th in the NBA after allowing an average of 98.0 points to finish fourth in the Western Conference last season. "We're having trouble stopping the basketball," coach Scott Brooks said. "When you play against a good team, when you make one mistake they capitalize on it. That's what a good team, an experienced team will do to you." Kevin Durant is looking for an improved effort after scoring 23 points - his second-lowest total of the season - against the Spurs after topping 30 points in each of the previous three contests - two wins. The forward, Oklahoma City's leader with an average of 28.2 points, has put up 34.8 points per game over the last four meetings with the Jazz. Durant had 45 points in his most recent visit to Utah, but had his shot at the buzzer blocked by C.J. Miles. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
