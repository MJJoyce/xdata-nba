Visiting Milwaukee has produced solid results for the 76ers recently. Surging Philadelphia looks to continue its dominance of the Bucks when it opens a five-game road trip Saturday night before heading west. The 76ers (34-31) have taken both meetings with Milwaukee this season in Philadelphia and nine of 11 overall in the series. They have won four of five visits to the Bradley Center since the start of the 2007-08 season. Before falling 110-105 in overtime to Oklahoma City on Wednesday night and beating Eastern Conference-leading Boston 89-86 on Friday night, Philadelphia extended its road winning streak Tuesday with a 110-100 victory over Indiana. The Sixers haven't won four straight outside Philadelphia since a five-game run from March 1-14, 2008. They are 7-2 in their last nine on the road after a 5-18 start away from home. Philadelphia is 17-6 in its last 23 overall and sits in seventh place in the conference, one-half game behind New York and seven in front of the Pacers and Charlotte. "We definitely feel like we're growing into one of the better teams in the East," said forward Elton Brand, who scored a team high-tying 14 points against the Celtics. The Sixers head to Utah following this game before concluding their trip with matchups against the Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento and Portland. "When I look at our schedule and stuff like that, I'm sick to my stomach," coach Doug Collins said. "We have to go (on the road for) five games, Milwaukee on a back-to-back ... that is a daunting task. So we've got to play good basketball and find some wins." Milwaukee (25-38), one game out of the eighth and final playoff spot in the East, is trying to tie its season-high winning streak at three following Wednesday's 110-90 home victory over Cleveland. The Bucks had their third-best shooting performance of the season at 55.1 percent while also scoring their third-most points. The 20-point victory came a night after they won 95-76 at Washington. "At this point, we're running out of time," said reserve guard Earl Boykins, who had 18 points against the Cavaliers. "It's time to win, no matter who the opponent is. If you can get a win, it's a good win. So, we're able to get the back-to-back wins. It's huge for us at this point of the season." Brandon Jennings also scored 18 for the Bucks, whose last five losses have come against clubs currently with winning records. "These are teams we should beat, so you can't really get too hyped about it or anything like that," Jennings said. Milwaukee averaged 86.5 points and shot 40.8 percent - 19.2 from 3-point range - in the two losses in Philadelphia. The Bucks have had trouble slowing down Sixers reserve guard Lou Williams, who is averaging 22.0 points - 8.5 more than his season mark - in the two meetings.
