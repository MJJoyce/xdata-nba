Celtics-Magic Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Nov 24 2012 10:05PM The Orlando Magic have found some life since returning to the Amway Center. Their five-home homestand, however, is about to get a lot tougher Sunday night when the Boston Celtics come to town. Orlando (5-7) seeks its third straight win on its home floor after rallying for a 108-104 victory over Cleveland on Friday. "We're just trying to deal with this homestand," coach Jacque Vaughn said. "We've started out 2-0 and now we're trying to get another one." After falling to 1-5 on the road with a loss to Atlanta on Monday, Orlando bounced back with consecutive wins over Detroit and Cleveland - teams with a combined 6-19 record - to improve to 4-2 at home. The difference between the Magic's offensive production home and away has been staggering. They're averaging 95.3 points on 47.3 percent shooting at home, while totaling 85.0 on 40.1 percent on the road. After sinking a season-high 11 from beyond the arc on Friday, Orlando is making 6.5 3-pointers per game at home compared to 4.2 in road contests. Jameer Nelson and Arron Afflalo each hit four 3-pointers and finished with 22 and 19 points, respectively, against the Cavaliers. Glen Davis faces his former team for the fourth time. After totaling 13 points on 5 of 20 from the field in his first two meetings against the Celtics, the Magic forward scored 27 on 12-of-16 shooting in his most recent matchup, a 102-98 road loss on April 18. "We need to get as much games as possible and try to get back to .500 and compete for the chance to be somewhere in the postseason," said Davis, who spent his first four years with the Celtics. "And also for our confidence and our young guys to make sure that they can learn and understand what we have to do to take the win." The Celtics (7-6) avoided a third straight loss with an impressive 108-100 victory over visiting Oklahoma City on Friday night. Boston recorded only its second win against a team that had a winning record heading into Friday night. "It's great to beat Oklahoma," coach Doc Rivers said. "They were in the finals last year, and they're the team to beat, I guess, in the West. But it was more how we played. We played with great force tonight." The Magic have a chance to continue their success at home against Boston, which has allowed opponents to shoot 53.1 percent while yielding at least 100 points in three consecutive games. The Celtics led the NBA in field-goal percentage defense (41.9) last season, but rank 27th this year (46.3). Paul Pierce heads into this matchup with some confidence after scoring 22 of his season high-tying 27 points in the second half against the Thunder. The veteran forward also has played well against the Magic, tallying 53 points and 24 rebounds in the last two meetings. Rajon Rondo had 16 assists against Oklahoma City - his 36th straight game with at least 10. He's averaging a league-leading 13.5 per contest. Boston has won five straight against Orlando, taking all three meetings last season despite Rondo sitting out each game because of wrist and back injuries.
