Grizzlies-Rockets Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 05 2011 2:28AM Thanks to their longest winning streak in five seasons, the Memphis Grizzlies are in the thick of the playoff hunt. A sixth consecutive victory may be hard to come by against the host Houston Rockets. The Grizzlies will try to avoid a 10th consecutive loss at Houston when the teams meet Saturday night. Memphis (27-24) received a bit of a scare Friday night versus lowly Cleveland - which tied an NBA record with its 23rd straight loss - but was able to erase a seven-point halftime deficit en route to a 112-105 victory - its fifth in a row. It's the longest winning streak for the Grizzlies since April 11-19, 2006, when they won five straight en route to their most recent postseason appearance. Memphis now leads Portland by one-half game for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. "We're not there yet. There's still a lot of basketball to be played," said Grizzlies guard Sam Young, who scored 19 points Friday. "We've still got to prove ourselves. We've got to go back (Saturday at Houston) and prove ourselves or there's a possibility we'll drop down again. "We're going to try to stay humble and let everybody know we're serious." The Grizzlies have won 10 of 13 - including a 115-110 home victory over Houston on Jan. 21 - since permanently inserting Young into the starting lineup. Young appears to be improving along with his team. His 19 points Friday matched a season high, and he's reached double figures in five straight games, matching his previous total of double-digit scoring efforts for the season. Rudy Gay had 26 points and 11 rebounds versus the Cavaliers for his first double-double since the season opener, while Zach Randolph recorded his 16th double-double in 17 games with 29 points and 13 rebounds. While the Grizzlies' win over the Rockets last month snapped a seven-game overall skid in the series, they've dropped nine straight at Houston by an average of 13.4 points, with their last win coming April 15, 2006. Houston (23-28) returns home after avoiding a winless four-game road trip with a 97-96 victory at Utah on Wednesday night. Kevin Martin completed a three-point play with 6.9 seconds remaining to put the Rockets up for good. "We knew this trip was going to be tough and to be honest we should be inspired by the way we played," said center Chuck Hayes, who had 13 points and 12 rebounds. "We fought every team...we have to take that momentum and that inspiration and bring it home and rack up some wins right before the All-Star break." Martin, who finished with 22 points Friday, could be in line for a big game against the Grizzlies. He is averaging 32.0 points in his last 12 games versus Memphis, including a 48-point performance Nov. 2, 2009, while with Sacramento. The Grizzlies have won four of five on the road while holding opponents to an average of 90.0 points. Memphis is 0-10 as the visiting team when allowing 100 or more points, though, and could have trouble slowing down a Houston offense averaging 105.0 points - fourth in the NBA.
