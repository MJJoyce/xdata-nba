A game against the Los Angeles Clippers could help them improve in both areas. Opening a stretch of back-to-back games away from home Wednesday, the Thunder will try to win their fourth straight road matchup with the Clippers, who hope Baron Davis will be ready to provide a spark for their inefficient offense. The Thunder (2-1) shot 46.2 percent and averaged 101.5 points last season en route to the franchise's first playoff appearance since 2005, but they are hitting just 39.9 percent of their attempts from the field. Oklahoma City missed 48 of 80 shots - 15 of 20 from 3-point range - in Sunday's 120-99 loss to Utah. It was the second-most points allowed by the Thunder at home since they relocated prior to the 2008-09 season. "Our offense is going to come around, but our problem tonight was the defensive end," point guard Russell Westbrook said after the Jazz hit 7 of 11 3-pointers and shot 53.0 percent. The Thunder, whose opponents are shooting 47.5 percent, are allowing 8.3 more points per game this season than in 2009-10. "It's kind of tough to watch, but we've got to move on," Kevin Durant said. The Thunder, who visit Portland on Thursday, face a Clippers team struggling on both ends of the floor under new coach Vinny Del Negro, who has already questioned the fitness of Davis. "I'm disappointed, but there's nothing I can do about it," Davis said of a sore left knee that sidelined him for Monday's 97-88 loss to San Antonio. "Hopefully it's just a one-game thing and I'll be ready for Wednesday." If he's not, rookie Eric Bledsoe will likely make his second straight start since backup Randy Foye could be sidelined for up to two weeks with a strained left hamstring. Del Negro doesn't like his team's chances if that's the case. "Other than Baron, we don't have anyone to penetrate, facilitate, push the tempo," he said. "If Baron's not ready, it makes it harder on everybody else." The Clippers, who are trying to avoid their second 0-5 start in three seasons, are among the league's worst shooting teams at 39.9 percent and near the bottom in scoring at 87.5 points per game. "We've just got to keep grinding it out and find ways to get easier baskets," Del Negro said. "We've got to do that off our defense." Los Angeles' opponents are averaging 100.8 points on 47.1 percent shooting. Slowing down Durant could be a challenge. He averaged 34.0 points and 9.0 rebounds last season as the Thunder won two of three from the Clippers, with both victories coming in Los Angeles. Oklahoma City will get its first look at rookie Blake Griffin, who is averaging 16.8 points and 10.3 rebounds. After shooting 1 for 11 in an 83-79 victory over the Clippers on Nov. 11, Westbrook had 15 points, nine assists, seven steals and six boards in a 104-87 win March 5.
