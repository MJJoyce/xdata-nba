Hornets-Pacers Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Dec 20 2010 12:14AM The New Orleans Hornets would like to end their road struggles. They may find some relief for at least one game. The Hornets attempt to avoid a sixth straight loss away from home by continuing their success against the Indiana Pacers at Conseco Fieldhouse on Monday night. New Orleans (16-11) has dropped seven of eight on the road after winning four of its first five there. The Hornets, who have been outscored by an average of 12.8 points during their five-game road losing streak, endured a similar skid Feb. 8-March 14, when they lost seven in a row away from New Orleans en route to a 13-28 road record last season. New Orleans failed to capitalize on four injuries to the Pistons on Sunday, falling 111-108 in overtime at Detroit. The Hornets allowed the Pistons to shoot 10 for 23 from 3-point range. "We gave up 59 points in the second half, and that doesn't count overtime," coach Monty Williams said. "We just didn't guard the ball. We kept giving them open 3-point shots when that was all they could hit." The Hornets may be in good position to end their road losing streak in Indiana (12-14), where they've won their last four visits. They've also won five in a row overall against the Pacers, but only by an average of 4.8 points. Chris Paul has averaged 23.0 points and 9.8 assists in five career games at Conseco Fieldhouse. The All-Star point guard missed a Feb. 19 home matchup with Indiana while recovering from knee surgery. New Orleans didn't need him, as David West picked up the slack with 29 points and nine rebounds in a 107-101 victory. The power forward put up 32 points and grabbed nine boards Sunday, and leads the Hornets with an average of 19.3 points. West's 7.2 rebounds per game rank second on the team. The Pacers have won three of their last four at home, improving to 7-6 there on the season. However, they're opening a three-game homestand with little momentum. They've dropped four of five overall after losing 99-88 at Boston on Sunday. Indiana has been outscored by an average of 14.8 points while shooting 38.6 percent in those four defeats. Danny Granger had a game-high 19 points against the Celtics, but missed 15 of 20 shots from the field, including 6 of 7 from 3 -point range. The Pacers are 7-2 this season when Granger shoots 50 percent or better from the field, and 5-11 when he shoots below 50 percent. Granger is averaging 24.3 points in his last four games against the Hornets, but shooting only 39.5 percent in those contests - all Pacers losses. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
