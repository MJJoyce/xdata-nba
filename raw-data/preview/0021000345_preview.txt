Timberwolves-Bulls Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Dec 11 2010 1:19AM Coming off a victory over the two-time defending NBA champions, the last thing the Chicago Bulls need is a letdown. The Bulls try to prevent that from happening while looking for a season-high fifth consecutive victory as they host the lowly Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night. Chicago (13-8) matched its longest winning streak of the season by beating the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time in almost four years, 88-84 at home Friday. "It was a big win," forward Carlos Boozer said. "Hopefully, we can look at this game later on in the playoffs and use it as homework come June." The 84 points were a season low for the Lakers and marked the third consecutive game Chicago held an opponent to 90 or fewer points. Oklahoma City, Cleveland and Los Angeles averaged 85.7 points on 39.0 percent shooting against the Bulls during that stretch. "We've said (the Bulls) are going to be in the top five or six (teams in the Eastern Conference), but right now, it looks like they're going to be above that," former Chicago and current Lakers coach Phil Jackson told the Bulls' official website. The Bulls last won five in a row Jan. 22-29. "It feels good," All-Star guard Derrick Rose said. "We've still got a lot more games to go. We're moving in the right direction." Though Chicago failed to score 90 points for the second game in a row, Rose posted 29 for the second straight contest. He's averaged 9.0 assists his last five games. "His will is special," Chicago coach Tom Thibodeau said. Boozer had 10 points with 11 rebounds for his second double-double in six games as a Bull. Chicago is 4-2 since Boozer's debut after he missed the first 15 games with a broken hand. The veteran forward has averaged 17.5 points and 12.5 boards in his last four versus Minnesota. Chicago has won two straight over the Timberwolves, holding them to fewer than 100 points in both contests. The Bulls have a good chance to continue that success while trying to hand Minnesota (6-17) a seventh consecutive road loss. Though the Timberwolves are 1-11 on the road, they are coming off a 109-99 win over Detroit on Friday. Kevin Love had 27 points with 18 rebounds, Luke Ridnour added 20 points with 10 assists and Darko Milicic recorded a career-high seven blocks as the Timberwolves overcame a 13-point first-quarter deficit to win for the second time in 10 games. "We have to be close there the whole way in order for us to win," Love said. "That keeps us on our toes. Eventually we're going to get over it and start accumulating some wins. (Friday) was one of, hopefully, many." Love, averaging 20.4 points and 15.7 boards, has an NBA-high 18 double-doubles. He has at least 15 rebounds in nine consecutive games, the longest stretch since Ben Wallace did it in 14 straight contests in 2002-03. The third-year center has averaged 24.9 points and 18.5 boards during that nine-game stretch. However, Love totaled 18 points and 16 rebounds combined in the two losses to Chicago last season.
