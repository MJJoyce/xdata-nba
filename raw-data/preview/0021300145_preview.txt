Jazz-Warriors Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Nov 16 2013 2:32AM Since slumping in the final two games of their recent road trip, the Golden State Warriors have gotten their prolific offense back on track during this homestand. A lack of scoring has been a problem for the Utah Jazz, who have had a difficult time simply staying close on the road. The Warriors will try to remain undefeated on their own court and keep the Jazz winless on the road Saturday night when the teams open a home-and-home set. With four players averaging at least 14 points, Golden State (6-3) leads the NBA in 3-point percentage (45.5), ranks second in field-goal percentage (49.1) and sits in the top 10 in scoring (105.2). The Warriors, though, put up a total of 164 points on 41.6 percent shooting while dropping consecutive games at San Antonio and Memphis to close out their recent four-game trip. After they erupted for 229 points on 53.0 percent shooting to win the first two games of this homestand, those uncharacteristic offensive scuffles seem like a distant memory. Golden State has averaged 113.0 points while winning its four home games by an average of 15.2 points. The Warriors are coming off a thrilling 116-115 victory over Oklahoma City on Thursday when Andre Iguodala made a baseline fadeaway as time expired. Iguodala, brought in from Denver in the offseason, finished with 14 points and nine assists. He's averaging 14.2 points on 60.0 percent shooting - including 17 of 34 from 3-point range. "He's exactly who we thought he was," said coach Mark Jackson, whose club committed seven turnovers - well below its 18.8 average. "We're so fortunate to have him on this basketball team." Klay Thompson, the team's leading scorer at 20.4 per game, had 27 points and made 6 of 9 from beyond the arc Friday. He's averaging 26.5 points in four home games, shooting 68.3 percent from the floor and 16 for 28 from long range. Backcourt mate Stephen Curry appears to be fine after missing the loss to San Antonio with an ankle injury. He's averaged 23.0 points while hitting 10 of 22 from 3-point range in his last three games. Curry and the Warriors are hoping to continue their recent surge in the finale of this three-game stay. They also have a chance to win seven of 10 to open a season for the first time since 2006. Aside from their 111-105 victory over New Orleans on Wednesday, the Jazz (1-9) haven't been able to get much going offensively during their dreadful start. On Friday, they shot 7 for 25 in the fourth quarter, blowing a seven-point lead in a 91-82 loss to visiting San Antonio. Utah ranks last in the NBA in scoring (88.8) and 3-point shooting (25.8 percent) while sitting near the bottom in field-goal percentage (40.9) and turnovers (18.7). The Jazz have been even worse on the road, averaging 84.6 points on 38.6 shooting while dropping their first five games by an average of 15.4 points. Gordon Hayward, the team leader with 19.8 points per game, will try to bounce back after missing 18 of 23 shots for 15 points against the Spurs. "Just missed a lot of shots tonight," said Hayward. Teammate Derrick Favors was a bright spot with 20 points and a career-high 18 rebounds. He's averaged 17.7 points on 56.1 percent shooting with 14.3 boards in his last three games. The Jazz, who host the Warriors on Monday, have won four of five in this series. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
