Pacers-Nuggets Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 23 2011 2:33AM The Denver Nuggets couldn't stop the Indiana Pacers in their last matchup. Now, they'll try to take care of business at home prior to their longest road trip of the season. Looking to avenge their worst loss of 2010-11, the Nuggets will try for a third straight home victory over the Pacers when the teams meet Sunday night. Denver (24-18) struggled mightily in its 144-113 loss at Indiana on Nov. 9, especially in the second half. The Nuggets allowed 54 points in the third quarter - when the Pacers made 20 consecutive shots - and 85 points in the second half. The 54 points were the fourth-most for a quarter in NBA history, and the 85 in a half were the most allowed by Denver since Jan. 10, 1991, when the Nuggets yielded 94 in the second half of a 156-133 loss to Houston. Indiana's 144 points were its most since March 7, 1991, when the Pacers beat the Nuggets 145-125. "I've never seen a team make every shot," Denver coach George Karl told the team's official website Saturday. "If you give them those 25 shots with nobody on them, they're not going make every shot. They were kind of in a stage where they had to start playing well and they did. It was tough." Denver, which has yet to lose back-to-back games at home, dropped to 19-5 at the Pepsi Center with a 107-97 loss Friday night against the Los Angeles Lakers, who shot 53.4 percent from the floor - the highest mark by a Nuggets opponent at home. The Nuggets, who currently occupy the seventh spot in the Western Conference, embark on a five-game road trip following this contest. "As I told a few of the guys (Saturday), this is going to be an important stretch for us to solidify to everybody that we're a playoff team and we're going to figure this out," Karl said. "Whatever happens, we're going to fight together and believe we're going to figure it out." Carmelo Anthony finished with 13 points -more than 10 below his season average - in the November loss to the Pacers. Indiana (16-24) has dropped a season-high four straight and seven of nine since the new year. The Pacers led by as many as 16 points in the first half Saturday night, but fell 97-92 at Portland. They need a victory in this contest to avoid an 0-4 road trip, and have lost 12 of 13 away from home overall. Danny Granger continues to be a bright spot for Indiana. He scored 24 points in the loss to the Blazers and is averaging 29.3 while shooting 58.0 percent on the current road trip. "We have to learn how to win in these situations and we're just not doing it. We're just not closing games out," Granger said. "We're hoping there is light at the end of the tunnel and we stop losing these games." Granger has averaged 34.0 points in his last two visits to Denver - both Pacers losses. Starting center Roy Hibbert returned for Indiana on Saturday after missing Wednesday night's game with an upper respiratory infection. He recorded 11 points and 10 rebounds for his 12th double-double of the season. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
