Cavaliers-Jazz Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Jan 09 2012 1:50PM The Utah Jazz just earned their first road win of the season. Winning is all they've done in Salt Lake City in 2011-12. Looking to extend its overall run to five games, Utah can open 5-0 at home for the first time since 2008-09 when it faces the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night. After losing by an average of 19.0 points in its first three road contests, Utah (5-3) defeated Golden State 88-87 on Saturday behind a season-high 18 points from Gordon Hayward, who hit the go-ahead free throw with 11 seconds left. The Jazz trailed by seven in the fourth quarter after leading by 12 less than six minutes into the game. "When we got down, we didn't break at all," coach Tyrone Corbin said. "The guys kept encouraging each other, 'Come on, man, we right in there.' "It was just great to be a part of." Utah is enjoying its longest win streak since a 7-0 run Nov. 20-Dec. 1, 2010, and is beginning a stretch of 10 of 12 at home. The team's last 5-0 start in Salt Lake City was in 2008-09 when it opened 6-0. Utah has won four of five at home over the Cavaliers after a 121-99 victory Jan. 14. Cleveland (4-4) committed 21 turnovers in that contest - its second-highest total of the season - and gave it away a season-high 24 times in a 98-78 loss at Portland on Sunday. "I didn't think that we had the focus that we needed mentally, for whatever reason, especially on the offensive end," said coach Byron Scott, whose team went 3 of 24 from 3-point range and shot 36.7 percent overall. "I've never seen us that flip with the ball, kind of throwing it everywhere like a hot potato." Despite a season-high 21 points along with four assists, rookie Kyrie Irving had four turnovers. The 19-year-old point guard has committed 13 turnovers as the Cavs have dropped two of three to start their seven-game trip. "We have to limit our mistakes going forward," Irving said. Devin Harris will match up with Irving as he faces Cleveland for the first time in a Jazz uniform. Acquired from New Jersey on Feb. 23, Harris totaled 45 points and 19 assists in his last two games against Cleveland last season. The Jazz could use another solid effort from shooting guard Raja Bell, who had nine points Saturday after scoring that many in his previous five games combined. Bell averaged 17.0 points and went 7 of 8 from 3-point range as the Jazz swept Cleveland last season for the first time since 2001-02. Antawn Jamison, leading the Cavs with 16.0 points per game, posted his second straight double-double in Salt Lake City with a 26-point, 11-rebound effort Jan. 14. Jazz forwards Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap combined for 26 and 10 in that contest. They had 35 and 20 as Utah won 101-90 at Cleveland on Dec. 20, 2010.
