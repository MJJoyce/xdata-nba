Wizards-Warriors Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Mar 26 2011 1:44PM The Golden State Warriors put on an impressive offensive display in their first game back home after a disappointing road trip. Failing to win as the visiting team has become all too familiar for the Washington Wizards. Coming off their highest scoring output of the season, the Warriors will try to hand the Wizards a 10th consecutive road loss Sunday night. Golden State (31-42) sits in 12th place in the Western Conference, nine games behind Memphis for the eighth and final playoff spot. With only nine games remaining, it's all but assured of missing out on the playoffs for the 16th time in 17 seasons. The Warriors had allowed an average of 115.3 points while losing six straight, including all four games on their recently completed trip. But they returned to Oracle Arena and routed Toronto 138-100 on Friday night thanks largely to season-best 61.4 percent shooting. Seven players scored in double figures while four had at least 21 points. The Warriors were especially prolific in the first half, scoring an NBA season-high 84 points. "I wanted to send a message to our team that we are building," coach Keith Smart said. "This is a process. The way we have always done it at this time of year, to sit back and not play, you've got your better players on your team who want to play and will play, and that's a good thing." Washington (17-54), meanwhile, dropped its ninth straight on the road with a 114-94 loss at Denver on Friday night. Although they lost in double overtime to the Clippers on Wednesday, the Wizards have been outscored by 21.0 points per game during the first three stops of a five-game trek and are an NBA-worst 1-34 away from home. Only the 1990-91 Kings have finished 1-40 on the road. "We don't look at our road record like that," said rookie Jordan Crawford, averaging 19.9 points over his last nine games. "We have only one win, but we still go out there believing we can win." Washington, which has taken a lead into halftime as the visiting team just five times all season, couldn't recover from a 15-0 Nuggets run to close out the first quarter. "It hurt," said Crawford. "That's what's killed on the road is our first halves cause we always play better in the second half. The first half always kills us." Nick Young, scoring a team-best 17.6 points per game, finished with 10 on 4-of-15 shooting off the bench Friday in his first game back since missing five with a bruised left knee. Young is averaging 11.5 points on 32.8 percent shooting in his last four games, but he scored 31 in a 106-102 loss to Golden State on March 2. Andray Blatche had 20 points, nine rebounds and six assists, but he has missed eight straight games with a shoulder injury and is unlikely to return Sunday. Stephen Curry, second on Golden State with 18.3 points per contest, scored 29 on March 2 and is averaging 27.7 against the Wizards over his career - his second-most versus any opponent. The Warriors have won four straight and 12 of 16 when Curry scores more than 20 points. Warriors swingman Dorell Wright is averaging 30.0 points on 71.9 percent shooting over his last two games. Golden State had won three straight home matchups with Washington before falling 118-109 on Dec. 18, 2009, despite 57 combined points from Curry and Monta Ellis.
