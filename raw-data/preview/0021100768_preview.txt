Nets-Warriors Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Mar 29 2012 3:31PM The New Jersey Nets and Golden State Warriors are both 13th in their respective conferences. While the Nets are coming off a win over one of the East's better teams, the Warriors fell to the West's worst club. If injury-plagued New Jersey's recent efforts by the Bay are any indication, though, another win could be hard to come by as it opens a four-game road swing Friday night. Despite having just eight players available after losing big men Shelden Williams (eye) and Jordan Williams (concussion-like symptoms) to injury, the Nets (17-35) beat Indiana 100-84 on Wednesday for just their second win in eight games. Deron Williams led the way with 30 points and nine assists as New Jersey posted its most lopsided victory of the season. "This was probably our best home win of the season against a playoff team," said Williams, who didn't mind playing short-handed. " ... I don't think you really think about it when you are playing the game. It's just something that happens. Guys go down sometimes and you just have to keep playing. I just try to keep playing the same way no matter what." While Brook Lopez, Jordan Farmar and Shelden Williams all are ruled out for this game, and Jordan Williams doubtful, former Warrior Anthony Morrow (bruised shoulder) could return from a two-game absence as the Nets try to snap their road woes versus Golden State (20-29). Since posting a 113-99 win at Golden State on Jan. 26, 2005, New Jersey has been outscored by an average of 8.5 points in dropping six in a row there. The Nets, however, have taken the last two matchups versus the Warriors - both at home. Deron Williams had 24 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds during a 107-100 win Jan. 18. One night after going toe-to-toe with the Los Angeles Lakers in a 104-101 loss, Golden State dropped to 2-8 over its last 10 games with Wednesday's embarrassing 102-87 defeat to New Orleans. The Warriors allowed the Hornets to shoot 54.4 percent from the field - the highest mark by an opponent all season. "There is a way to lose, believe it or not," coach Mark Jackson said. "Playing in this league I understand that, I know you are not going to win every game. "Certainly (Wednesday) wasn't the way to lose. I understand back-to-back nights, I understand a battle against the Lakers with a tough loss, but where we are headed - teams respond by taking care of their business and taking out that tough loss on a team that we are better than." Averaging 22.3 points and 11.5 rebounds over his last four games, David Lee continued his impressive play with 28 points, seven boards and five assists. Klay Thompson scored 13 points while Dorell Wright and Brandon Rush each chipped in 12. "There's no such thing as overlooking a team when we're the third-worst team in the West," said Lee, who had 24 points and 10 rebounds during a 109-100 home win over New Jersey on Jan. 17, 2011. "We don't have that luxury." The Warriors have dropped 12 of 13 when their opponents shoot at least 48.0 percent from the floor. The Nets' 10 road wins are one more than their previous two seasons combined. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
