A big disparity on the glass didn't hurt them in their first meeting with the Charlotte Bobcats this season. The Pacers look for a better effort when they try to hand the Bobcats their sixth straight road loss Friday night. Indiana (10-10) lost for the third time in four games Wednesday, 97-95 at Milwaukee. The Pacers were outrebounded 50-37 and matched a season high in offensive boards allowed. "We held them to 36 percent shooting, but gave up 19 offensive rebounds," said coach Jim O'Brien, whose club ranks first in the league in field-goal percentage defense at 42.7. "That was the difference in the game." Despite a frontcourt of 7-foot-2 Roy Hibbert, 6-10 Josh McRoberts and 6-9 Danny Granger, Indiana has yielded at least 18 offensive rebounds in three of its last four games. Hibbert and Granger combined for nine total boards Wednesday. "At halftime Hibbert had no rebounds after 11 minutes and I think Danny had one," O'Brien said. "We've got to do a better job at that end and it hasn't been a problem up to this point." The Pacers were able to overcome it in a 104-101 win Oct. 29 that spoiled the Bobcats' home opener. Indiana, third in the league with 43.5 rebounds per game, was beaten 45-34 on the glass, but committed 10 turnovers to 17 for Charlotte. Granger scored 33 points. Charlotte (8-13) has been sloppy all season, with an Eastern Conference-worst 16.9 turnovers per game. The Bobcats overcame 18 giveaways that led to 28 points for Denver in a 100-98 victory Tuesday. "Still 28 points off turnovers," coach Larry Brown said. "The turnovers, I can't even explain them." Stephen Jackson scored 23 points, Gerald Wallace added 20 and Tyrus Thomas had 16 off the bench for Charlotte, which is looking to win consecutive games for the second time this season. "We have to start winning games now, so we don't have to use so much energy at the end of the season to be in the position we want to be in," Jackson said. Jackson hasn't played well in his returns to Conseco Fieldhouse since being traded by Indiana to Golden State during the 2006-07 season. He scored 36 points Feb. 5, 2007 in a victory in his first game back with the Warriors before averaging 17.2 on 36.4 percent shooting in his next five - all losses. Point guard D.J. Augustin has poor numbers against Indiana, shooting 25.5 percent in seven career games. He had 18 points on 7 of 11 from the field Tuesday, and the Bobcats want to see more of that. "We are a better team and we're more aggressive when he is aggressive," Jackson said. "The offense opens up and when he comes off pick-and-rolls and is aggressive to score, that opens up shots for me and Gerald. I think when D.J. is aggressive, the team is better."
