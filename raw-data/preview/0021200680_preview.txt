Hornets-Jazz Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Jan 30 2013 2:06PM It may be only one loss, but the Utah Jazz were humiliated on their home court in their last game. That doesn't tend to be a problem when hosting the New Orleans Hornets. Coming off the most-lopsided home defeat in franchise history, the Jazz look to re-establish their success in Salt Lake City by beating the last-place Hornets for the 10th time in 13 games there Wednesday night. Utah (24-21) has been much more effective at home, going 15-5 compared to 9-16 on the road. The Jazz extended their home winning streak to six by beating Indiana 114-110 in overtime on Sunday, but that run came to an alarming end with Monday's 125-80 defeat to Houston. Utah made 39.5 percent from the field - 5 of 18 from beyond the arc - and was outscored 26-2 in transition. "One loss. We were terrible," coach Ty Corbin said. "Whether you lose by one or 45, it's one loss. This team has shown a lot of grit and character all year long, and we'll respond. "We don't feel sorry for ourselves." Utah will again be without starting guard Gordon Hayward, who will miss his second straight game due to a sprained right shoulder. The Jazz have split two meetings with the Hornets (15-30), but both have come in New Orleans. A visit from the team tied with Phoenix for the worst record in the Western Conference seems to be just what Utah needs to bounce back. The Jazz have won nine of the last 11 home meetings with the Hornets, averaging 103.3 points while connecting on 49.1 percent from the floor - 46.0 from long range. Al Jefferson is averaging 23.0 points and 10.5 rebounds over his last four home matchups with New Orleans. Jefferson, Utah's leading scorer at 17.0 per game, may be relieved to face the Hornets after scoring 12 or fewer in three of the last four contests. Paul Millsap, who is second on the team in scoring at 14.6 per game, missed 7 of 9 field goals to finish with a season-low four points Monday after getting 21 versus the Pacers. The Hornets opened a five-game road trip with a 91-83 victory over Memphis on Sunday, and nearly made it back-to-back wins only to have their fourth-quarter rally from an 18-point deficit fall short in Tuesday's 111-106 defeat to the Los Angeles Lakers. "We're a young team that's still building chemistry, and to come back like that is a really good confidence boost for the guys," guard Eric Gordon said. "We had a chance to win. We were getting a lot of stops and were scoring at will. It just boiled down to the final plays." Gordon, averaging 17.4 points in 14 games since returning from an injured knee, is looking to build on his season-high 25 points from Tuesday, when he made 6 of 8 from 3-point range. Gordon has 23.2 points per game over his past five meetings with the Jazz. However, he's faced them only once in a Hornets uniform, scoring 25 while sinking 11 of 18 attempts from the floor in a 96-85 home win April 13, 2012.
