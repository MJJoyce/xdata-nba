Bobcats-Raptors Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Mar 12 2011 4:43PM After snapping a season-worst six-game losing streak their last time out, the Charlotte Bobcats have a chance to end their road skid with a matchup they've controlled this season. Hoping to avoid a sixth consecutive road loss, the Bobcats will try to sweep the Toronto Raptors as they embark on a four-game trip Sunday. With some help from the Raptors, Charlotte (27-38) moved into a tie with Indiana for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference after recording a 97-92 win over Portland on Friday night. The Bobcats had averaged 81.7 points on 41.5 percent shooting during their six-game slide, the last half of which was played without leading scorer Stephen Jackson. Jackson, though, returned from a strained left hamstring to score a career-best 18 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter Friday, as former teammate Gerald Wallace made his return to Charlotte for the first time since getting dealt prior to the trade deadline. "It's a lot of love there. We both want to win, but the respect is unbelievable," said Jackson, who also recorded a season-high-tying 10 rebounds. "I love him to death and I wish him the best, but we needed this game more than they did." After sitting out 24 games with a torn meniscus in his left knee, forward Tyrus Thomas also returned, registering two points and six boards. Thomas scored 14 points off the bench in each of Charlotte's first two wins over Toronto, although he was sidelined when the Bobcats prevailed 114-101 on Feb. 22 to clinch the season series for the first time in franchise history. Completing a sweep may be difficult. Charlotte, which ranks 29th in the league with 93.3 points per game, has been outscored by an average of 19.6 during its five-game road skid. Jackson had averaged 29.5 points - 10.3 more than his season mark - in his six previous road games before totaling 15 in his last two. He has scored a lackluster 13.3 points per game against Toronto this season. The Raptors (18-47), who entered Friday night losers of 23 of 27, beat the Pacers 108-98 to snap a three-game slide despite a season-low eight points on 1-of-13 shooting from Andrea Bargnani. Bargnani, who leads the team with 21.8 points per game, averaged 29.0 in Toronto's two losses to New Jersey in London on March 4-5 but was sidelined with flu-like symptoms in Wednesday night's 96-94 loss to Utah. "You count the jet lag and the illness, and he's got five days where he hasn't been able to do anything," coach Jay Triano said. "(He) struggled with his shot, but still he's a threat out there and if they guard him the same way whether he's feeling well or not, then that opens up the floor for other guys." Leandro Barbosa took advantage of that, scoring a season-best 29 points on 12-of-21 shooting. Bargnani had 25 points in a 101-96 home loss to Charlotte on Nov. 10 but averaged just 15.0 on 37.9 percent shooting in the next two meetings. DeMar DeRozan, second on the team with 16.5 points per game, has averaged 10.7 against the Bobcats this season. Forward Amir Johnson sprained his ankle Wednesday and was held out against Indiana. His status for this game is unknown. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
