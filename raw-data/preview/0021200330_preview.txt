Warriors-Magic Preview By ALAN FERGUSON Posted Dec 13 2012 2:06PM The Golden State Warriors would appear to have a good chance to pull off an unprecedented feat when they visit the struggling Orlando Magic. They couldn't get past the Magic at home earlier this month, however. The Warriors try to avenge their latest defeat and end their recent woes in the series as they go for a 6-0 start on their seven-game road trip Friday night. Golden State (15-7) has never won the first six games of any road trip but is in position to accomplish that after edging Miami 97-95 on Wednesday. Rookie forward Draymond Green made a go-ahead layup with 0.9 seconds left in that win and Klay Thompson matched a season high with 27 points. David Lee scored 22 and Jarrett Jack added 20 to make up for a subpar night from Stephen Curry, who was held to nine points after scoring at least 20 in eight straight games. "We're on fire right now," Thompson said. "We're going to continue building on this. This is a special win. We haven't played the best competition the last few games but with the Miami Heat, we're showing people we're going to bring it every night. We have a chance to be special." The Warriors also have a chance to match their 16-7 start from 1991-92 and improve to 7-1 in December, their best opening to the month since winning 10 of their first 11 in 1975-76. In the next-to-last stop on its longest road trip of the season, Golden State will face a Magic team that's averaged 85.3 points during a 1-3 stretch and has dropped four in a row at home, its longest such losing streak in five seasons. Orlando shot 38.3 percent and scored 34 points in the first half in its latest defeat, 86-80 to visiting Atlanta on Wednesday. With 16 points, Arron Afflalo was the only player to score more than 13. "The way we start the game has to be with more energy. One of us, next game, will take it upon ourselves to make sure that it happens," Afflalo said. Orlando (8-13) had few problems with its energy at Golden State on Dec. 3, scoring  28 in the opening quarter and had 51 points at the half. Afflalo and Glen Davis each had 24 points in that 102-94 victory and J.J. Redick scored 10 of his 22 in the fourth quarter. The Magic have won seven of eight in the series - with the lone loss coming in overtime on March 11, 2011 - and three straight home matchups. Orlando will try to add to that streak while avoiding its first five-game skid on its floor since dropping seven in a row March 13-April 10, 2004. Golden State, meanwhile, is seeking its first six-game road win streak since March 12-April 6, 2005. Curry will try to help by recording his third consecutive double-double against the Magic. He had a team-best 25 points and 11 assists in the loss earlier this month. David Lee scored 22 points in that game, and is averaging a team-leading 24.2 points and 13.4 rebounds during the trip. The former University of Florida standout has topped 20 points in each of his last two games against the Magic but is averaging 10.1 in eight career games in Orlando, his worst showing in any opponent's building.
