Timberwolves-Rockets Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Feb 08 2011 1:36AM Injuries to a pair of key players might impede the Minnesota Timberwolves' latest attempt at making progress. Coming off a rare road victory, the visiting Timberwolves could be without two starters Tuesday night when they try to avoid a 14th consecutive loss to the Houston Rockets, who are looking for a fourth straight win. Minnesota (12-39) shot 50 percent in the second half to improve to 3-23 on the road with a 104-92 victory at New Orleans on Monday. However, the Timberwolves could be without second-leading scorer Michael Beasley (19.9 points per game) after he needed to be helped off because of a left leg injury and center Darko Milicic strained his left hip flexor Monday. "It was unfortunate we lost Darko and Michael," Timberwolves coach Kurt Rambis said. The Timberwolves already have been without guard Luke Ridnour four straight games due to personal matters and swingman Martell Webster two because of back spasms. It's uncertain if either will return Tuesday. Even at full strength the Timberwolves were likely to be in for a major challenge trying to beat Houston (25-28) for the first time since Jan. 7, 2007. Minnesota's 13-game skid against the Rockets is tied for the club's third-longest current losing streak to any opponent. Minnesota is 8-60 away from home since last posting consecutive road victories April 7-8, 2009. The Timberwolves have averaged 88.3 points during an eight-game road skid at Houston dating to an 82-79 win April 12, 2006. Houston has averaged 124.5 points in two games against the Minnesota this season, including a 120-94 home victory Nov. 7. Minnesota All-Star Kevin Love had 16 points with 16 rebounds in that contest, but has been limited to 11.5 points in four career games at Houston. If Beasley and Milicic are out, the Rockets are likely to direct their attention at stopping Love, who had 27 points and 17 rebounds Monday. Those injuries could mean more time for reserves Nikola Pekovic and Anthony Tolliver, who each scored 12 points against the Hornets. "It shows people, I guess, the potential that we have," Tolliver said. "It's just that we haven't put it together." Houston has been able to put things together of late. Kevin Martin scored 37 points and Luis Scola added 25 as the Rockets held Denver to 16 third-quarter points and overcame 50 from Carmelo Anthony in Monday's 108-103 road win. "We played a great game as a team," said Martin, who added a season-high seven assists. "Outside of Carmelo, didn't nobody really do anything." After falling 114-106 in overtime to the Lakers last Tuesday, the Rockets have won the last three by a combined eight points. Averaging 30.0 points the last four games, Martin scored 34 in a 129-125 win at Minnesota on Jan. 24. The Rockets could have guard Aaron Brooks back after he served a one-game suspension for leaving the court in the fourth quarter of the team's win over Memphis on Saturday. Averaging 12.2 points and 4.1 assists in 28 games, Brooks missed 24 games with a sprained ankle and has been frustrated about his diminished role. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
