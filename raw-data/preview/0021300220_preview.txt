Bulls-Pistons Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Nov 26 2013 1:17PM As the Chicago Bulls try to end their current slide and move on from another season-ending injury to star Derrick Rose, the Detroit Pistons hope they've found a rhythm that will help string together some victories. The visiting Bulls look to avoid a fifth straight defeat while trying to prevent the Pistons from a season-high third consecutive win Wednesday night. Chicago's five-game winning streak ended Thursday when it opened a six-game trip with a 97-87 loss at Denver. Things got worse Friday when Rose tore the medial meniscus in his right knee during a 98-95 loss at Portland in his 10th game since missing all of last season while recovering from a torn ACL in his left knee. It's been downright horrendous the last two games for the Bulls (6-7), who lost 121-82 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday and 89-83 in overtime Monday to a Utah team which lost by 24 at Chicago a little more than two weeks ago. "We've got to snap out of it," said forward Joakim Noah, who had 10 points and 13 rebounds before fouling out Monday. "We are human and we are disappointed in the way we are playing and disappointed in everything that is going on." Even with Rose on the court for the early portion of the trip, the Bulls are averaging 86.8 points and shooting 39.0 percent during a four-game slide that's their longest in the regular season since Tom Thibodeau became coach in 2010-11. Chicago last dropped five straight in the regular season during a 10-game skid from Feb. 27-March 19, 2010. "We've got to find ourselves," said Thibodeau, whose team is 1-7 on the road. Carlos Boozer had 26 points with 16 rebounds and Luol Deng added 24 with 10 boards, but guards Kirk Hinrich, Marquis Teague, rookie Tony Snell and journeyman Mike James combined for 12 points on 4-of-14 shooting against the Jazz. "We'll get it together," Deng told the Bulls' official website. "I think we'll get there. We're going to make adjustments and get there." Minus Rose, the Bulls' 18-game winning streak against the Pistons (6-8) ended with a 99-85 loss at Detroit on April 7. The Pistons beat Brooklyn and Milwaukee on consecutive days to post back-to-back victories for the first time this season. Brandon Jennings had 15 points and 13 assists to lead seven double-figure scorers as Detroit shot a season-high 53.8 percent during a 113-94 win over the Bucks on Monday. "We needed it," coach Maurice Cheeks said. "We don't want to keep winning one game and losing two games, one game. We never can get any rhythm like that." Jennings is averaging 15.7 points but has been inconsistent while shooting 37.2 percent during his first season in Detroit. However, he's averaged 12.3 assists in the last three games while looking to get forwards Josh Smith and Greg Monroe more involved. "We have a lot of talent. We've just got to put the chemistry together," he said. Jennings has averaged 14.9 points while shooting 36.9 percent in 14 games against the Bulls, but made half of his 24 shots to finish with 35 during a 104-96 win at Chicago on Jan. 9 while with Milwaukee. Boozer has totaled 45 points in the last two games at Detroit. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
