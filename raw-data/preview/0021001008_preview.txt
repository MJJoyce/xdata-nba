Suns-Hornets Preview By MATT BEARDMORE Posted Mar 15 2011 1:59PM While the New Orleans Hornets are trying to get closer to earning a playoff berth with their star point guard back in the lineup, the Phoenix Suns' postseason hopes have been fading without theirs. Chris Paul and the Hornets look to rebound from one of their worst defensive efforts of the season Wednesday night when they host a Suns team that has struggled to score without Steve Nash in action. Since missing two games while recovering from a mild concussion, Paul is averaging 30.0 points, 12.5 assists, 6.0 rebounds and 6.0 steals in two contests. He's a big reason New Orleans (39-30) is sixth in the Western Conference, 1 1/2 games clear of Memphis for the eighth and final playoff spot and four ahead of 10th-place  Phoenix (33-32). The Hornets dropped two games behind fifth-place Denver on Monday, losing 114-103 to the Nuggets despite Paul finishing with 27 points, 10 assists and a season high-tying seven steals. New Orleans, allowing a conference-low 93.0 points per game, gave up a season-high 17 3-pointers and fell to 1-13 when yielding 10 or more. "When you see that ball go through the hole 17 times from the 3, it tends to mess with your psyche a little bit," coach Monty Williams said. "It was just one of those games that you have in the NBA where a team comes out and they just shoot the ball better than you've ever seen them before. ... Our guys fought tonight. We just didn't have enough to overcome that many 3s." That might not be a major concern Wednesday if Nash isn't distributing the ball, and especially considering Phoenix has shot just 26.9 percent (14 of 52) from 3-point range during its three-game losing streak. Nash has missed the last two with what is officially being listed as "pelvic instability," but said he should be ready to go Wednesday. However, if the two-time MVP sits again, backup point guard Aaron Brooks will have to deliver a better performance than he did in Monday's 95-93 loss to Houston. Returning to the Toyota Center for the first time since the Suns acquired him from the Rockets in a deadline deal, Brooks missed eight of nine shots and finished with two points and three assists as Phoenix fell to 0-4 this season without Nash. "I'm glad the Houston game is over," Brooks said. "I had a bad game and now I'll move on." The Suns, among the league leaders with 104.9 points per game, are averaging 92.7 during their skid while shooting 41.9 percent from the field. Phoenix last dropped four straight during a season-worst 0-4 stretch from Dec. 20-29. The Suns, though, have won three in a row over New Orleans, including a 104-102 home  victory Jan. 30 in the only meeting this season. Phoenix nearly blew an eight-point lead in the final 18 seconds, as Paul's 3-pointer at the buzzer missed the rim. He finished with team highs of 26 points and 12 assists. Nash had 15 assists in that matchup while backup center Marcin Gortat had a career-best 25 points with 11 boards. Beginning Wednesday, the Hornets and Suns play three times in 24 days.
