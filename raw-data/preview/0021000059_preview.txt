The Houston Rockets, meanwhile, have plenty of work to do defensively. The Hornets look to match the best start in franchise history Wednesday night as Trevor Ariza returns to Houston, where second-half lapses have plagued his former team during a winless start. A healthy Chris Paul, who missed 37 games last season, gave New Orleans (3-0) reason for optimism, but a 1-7 preseason under first-year coach Monty Williams and its superstar's own uncertain future left the Hornets with an uneasy outlook. A tough early schedule didn't figure to help, but so far New Orleans has done just fine. After totaling 23 assists in home wins over Milwaukee and Denver, Paul scored 25 points in a 99-90 win at San Antonio on Saturday to help his team improve to 3-0 for the fourth time in five seasons. "I like it, but I'm not surprised," Paul said of the fast start. "We're professionals. Every night we step out there on the court we go out there with the mindset that we're going to win." Paul is the league's only player averaging at least 20 points, nine assists and six rebounds, but it's the Hornets' defense that has them on the verge of matching their 2006-07 and 2007-08 starts as the best in franchise history. New Orleans has held opponents to an average of 92.0 points, a vast improvement over the 105.5 points per game it allowed after the All-Star break last season. "To me if people don't understand how important defense is, they should now," Williams said. "Our team defense is coming along, (but) we're not there yet. ... We're making improvements." One reason for that defensive success has been Ariza, whom the Hornets acquired from Houston (0-3) in a four-team offseason trade that netted the Rockets reserve guard Courtney Lee. Ariza, who had an up-and-down season in Houston after signing a five-year, $35 million deal in 2009, is averaging 2.7 steals even as he's struggled offensively (10.3 ppg). The Rockets could certainly use Ariza's defensive energy right now. Houston has allowed a league-worst 117.0 points per game during an 0-3 start in which it's led at halftime of each game. Denver shot 37.8 percent overall Saturday in the Rockets' home opener, but scored 59 points after halftime in a 107-94 win. For a team that harbored lofty expectations with a healthy Yao Ming in the fold, Houston's start - its worst since opening 0-5 in 1999-2000 - isn't what it was expecting. "No one's jumping off this boat yet," forward Shane Battier said. "We'll correct the mistakes because we have good players, good coaches and we just need to do things a little bit better ... and it will turn." Frontcourt mate Luis Scola, who's averaged 27.3 points and 14.0 rebounds, recognizes the importance of Wednesday's contest. "We need this game," Scola said. "We need it big time." New Orleans won three of four in the series last season despite Paul missing the last two meetings, as David West more than made up for his absence. The two-time All-Star averaged 39.5 points and 11.0 rebounds in the two trips to Houston, including a career-high 44-point effort in a 108-100 loss Dec. 29. Ariza had 26 points, 10 boards and 10 assists - his lone career triple-double - in the Rockets' 123-115 loss April 14. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
