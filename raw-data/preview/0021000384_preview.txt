Coming off their first win in almost three weeks, the visiting Nets look to avoid a sixth consecutive loss to the Toronto Raptors on Friday night in a matchup of struggling teams. New Jersey (7-19) snapped an eight-game slide Thursday with a 97-89 win over Washington - the only team in the Eastern Conference with a worse record than the Nets. "This was one we had to have," said guard Devin Harris, who called a team meeting before the game. "We have to be able to get it any way we can." Harris had 29 points with nine assists, while Brook Lopez added 18 points and Kris Humphries had 12 with 17 rebounds as the Nets won for the first time since beating Portland 98-96 on Nov. 28. "We needed to hold ourselves accountable a little," Lopez said. "We're all sick of losing." Though New Jersey earned some confidence, another challenge awaits in Canada. The Nets are 2-11 away from home and have averaged 90.6 points during a nine-game road skid following consecutive wins at Cleveland and the Los Angeles Clippers on Nov. 15-17. New Jersey last beat the Raptors, 94-87 at Toronto on Dec. 15, 2008. Though Toronto (9-17) has averaged 107.8 points and shot 54.4 percent during its five-game winning streak over the Nets, Chris Bosh was in the lineup for all but one of those contests. With Bosh now playing for Miami, the Raptors no longer have a superstar presence. Toronto has lost two in a row and six of seven after falling 110-93 at home to Chicago on Wednesday. It marked the second straight game in which Toronto - averaging 102.0 points - was held to fewer than 95. The Raptors knew they were outplayed against the Bulls, but also admitted they were physically inferior at both ends of the court, and that's happened more than once this season. "It's embarrassing and I don't like it," said Jerryd Bayless, who had 20 points. "I'm not used to it and I'm not going to stand for it. We've got to get better." Injuries have plagued the Raptors of late. Jose Calderon (foot) could miss a fifth straight game and Peja Stojakovic (knee) his 11th in a row. Toronto also could be without leading scorer Andrea Bargnani (21.0 ppg) for a second consecutive contest because of a sore left knee. Leandro Barbosa scored 21 versus Chicago, and has averaged 19.3 on 27-of-49 shooting the last four games. Harris has averaged 18.7 points and 8.7 assists in his last three against the Raptors. Sasha Vujacic, acquired by the Nets in a three-team deal with Houston and the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, did not play Thursday. It's uncertain if he will make his New Jersey debut in this contest. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
