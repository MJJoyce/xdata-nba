Warriors-Grizzlies Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Nov 09 2013 1:40AM The Golden State Warriors tend to struggle without Stephen Curry, but having him hasn't made much of a difference against the Memphis Grizzlies. With Curry's status unclear, the Warriors attempt to bounce back from their latest defeat without him in order to win at Memphis for the first time in more than five years Saturday night. Curry led Golden State (4-2) with a career-high 22.9 points per game and 6.9 assists last season, while his 272 3-pointers set a single-season NBA record. He's averaging 18.6 points and 9.2 assists while connecting on 18 of 39 from beyond the arc this season. His importance to the Warriors has been evident when he's missing - especially on the road. They're 16-39 without Curry, dropping 23 of 31 contests away from home. That trend continued Friday, when Curry was sidelined by a bruised left ankle and had to watch Andre Iguodala's layup at the buzzer roll off the rim in a 76-74 loss at San Antonio. Golden State shot a season-low 40.8 percent from the field. Curry is considered day-to-day. His status may not matter since the Warriors have dropped nine straight meetings with the Grizzlies, and Curry has averaged 22.9 points in eight of them. He poured in 32 with eight assists and five rebounds in a 99-93 defeat in the most recent visit to Memphis (2-3) on Feb. 8. The Warriors have lost eight in a row there dating to a victory on April 4, 2008. If Curry is out, Klay Thompson will try to pick up the slack. He was held to 11 points while missing 11 of 16 attempts from the floor against the Spurs, but still leads the Warriors with 21.8 points per game. Thompson, though, has averaged 5.7 points on 7 for 26 shooting - 1 for 8 from 3-point range - in three games at Memphis. David Lee, who had a season-low 13 points Friday, has totaled 48 with 19 rebounds over his last two road meetings with the Grizzlies. Memphis, which has alternated wins and losses through the first five games, may be hoping a meeting with the Warriors can allay some frustration following Wednesday's 99-84 home loss to New Orleans. "We are a little frustrated," guard Mike Conley said. "If we lost giving the effort that we normally give and laid it all out there, we would have been fine with that. I saw that we came back at the end, but we were never really in the game." Conley leads the Grizzlies with 20.2 points after getting 26 against the Pelicans, though he left in the fourth quarter with a cut that required three stitches after catching an inadvertent elbow from New Orleans' Anthony Morrow. Conley has averaged 12.8 over his past five meetings with Golden State, including seven points while making 2 of 7 field goals Feb. 8. While Conley is likely to be in the lineup, Zach Randolph's status is uncertain after leaving in the first half Wednesday to be with his fiance for the birth of their first child. Randolph averaged 16.7 points and 12.7 rebounds in three meetings with Golden State last season. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
