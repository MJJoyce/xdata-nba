Wizards-Spurs Preview By KEVIN CHROUST Posted Nov 13 2013 1:58AM Tim Duncan wasn't on the court the last time the Washington Wizards scored 100 points against the Spurs in San Antonio. That's because his college career came to an end the night before when his 1996-97 Wake Forest team was eliminated from the NCAA Tournament. The Spurs have won 14 straight against the Wizards, including 13 in a row at home, and haven't allowed them to crack 100 in San Antonio since March 17, 1997 - a span of 16 games. Duncan's Demon Deacons bowed out in the second round to Stanford on March 16. Duncan has been on the court for every game during all three streaks and should be again Wednesday night when the Spurs (7-1) try to extend them. The 17-season veteran didn't play in Monday's 109-85 win over Philadelphia after coach Gregg Popovich elected to rest the three-time NBA Finals MVP. Danny Green made 5 of 7 attempts from 3-point range on his way to a team-high 18 points. Six Spurs players scored in double figures as they extended their current winning streak to five. "It's been pretty good basketball for us," Green said. "We're moving the ball, cleaned things up defensively and we're headed in the right direction." Green is averaging 16.0 points over his last four after putting up only 3.5 per game in his first four. He's 11 of 15 from long range in his previous two, while the team has hit 25 of 56 from beyond the arc. The Spurs have won their last two by an average of 27.5 points after Sunday's 120-89 victory in New York. "We were not playing that well the previous four games," Manu Ginobili said. "But in New York and here, we really took care of business from minute one. We made it look easy." The Spurs have held their last three opponents to 82.7 points per game on 40.0-percent shooting. They've won those three games by an average of 19.0 points. Those numbers are right in line with what they've done to the Wizards over the course of the 13-game home winning streak. The Spurs have held Washington to 83.8 points and 39.5 percent shooting while outscoring them by an average of 16.8. The Spurs are holding opponents to the league's third-lowest average (91.5), while the Wizards are allowing the second-most points at 106.6 per game. They're the only NBA team to allow 100 points in every game this year, and their 48.6-percent opponent field goal percentage is the league's worst. The Wizards (2-5) have lost two in a row after falling 105-95 Tuesday night at Dallas. They opened their three-game trip two nights before with a 106-105 overtime loss in Oklahoma City. "That's the confusing part," Wizards guard Bradley Beal said. "We played so aggressively and so hard against OKC. It was like Game 7 of the finals or something. Then now, we come out tonight and not have that same mentality." Beal scored a season-low nine Tuesday after going for a career-high 34 Sunday. The second-year guard is averaging 21.0 points and hitting 47.6 percent of his 3-point shots. San Antonio beat the Wizards 96-86 at home in the last meeting Feb. 2.
