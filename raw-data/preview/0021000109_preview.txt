They're not starting off the same way in 2010-11, but it hasn't hurt them in the standings. The Magic (5-1) will try to heat up from long distance and continue their winning ways Wednesday night when they host the Utah Jazz. Orlando set an NBA record by making 841 3-pointers in 2009-10, shooting them at a 37.5-percent clip. Now, the Magic have made 52 shots from beyond the arc through their first six games, but are shooting only 32.3 percent on 3-point attempts. "I'm especially surprised with this team's shooting, especially since we're a knock-down 3-point shooting team," said forward Rashard Lewis, who is 9 for 31 from long range. "So far this season we're not knocking them down." "Good thing that Dwight (Howard) is playing MVP basketball inside. If it weren't for that there's no telling what our record would be right now." Howard is averaging a career-best 23.2 points. He had 27 with 11 rebounds Monday, carrying Orlando to a 93-89 win over Atlanta even as his Magic teammates missed 18 of 22 from long range. "That's what great teams do and we want to be a great team," Howard said. "In order to do that, we have to take a team's best punches and then throw back and I think we did that tonight." The Magic remain confident that the 3-pointers will also start going in the hoop. "Our shots are going to fall so as long as we're playing hard and with some energy, then we're going to be in every game," guard J.J. Redick said. The Jazz (4-3) have won four of five after an 0-2 start, and seek a two-game Florida sweep after possibly their most impressive win of the season. Paul Millsap scored a career-high 46 points Tuesday night as Utah defeated Miami 116-114 in overtime despite a triple-double from LeBron James. "I guess when it rains, it pours," said Millsap, averaging a team-high 24.0 points. After rallying from 18 points down to beat the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, Utah came back from a 22-point second-quarter deficit against the Heat. Deron Williams added 21 points and 14 assists. "It's speechless, to be down like that to a team like this and to come out with a win," Millsap said. "We clawed our way out of it. But this says a lot about our team." The Jazz are averaging 117.5 points in their four wins but 86.7 in their three losses. They could have trouble scoring against the Magic, who are allowing an NBA-low 88.7 points per game. The Magic have won six of their last seven home meetings with the Jazz. With another victory Wednesday, Orlando will start the season 5-0 at home for the fourth time in franchise history.
