Celtics-Warriors Preview By JORDAN GARRETSON Posted Jan 09 2014 4:29PM The Golden State Warriors squandered their chance at a historic road victory, but they should have a good chance to resume their winning ways when they return home to face the struggling Boston Celtics. Golden State tries to win for the 11th time in 12 games Friday night in a matchup with Boston, loser of six in a row and nine of 10. The Warriors (24-14) came within one win of finishing the first unbeaten road trip of seven or more games in league history, instead losing 102-98 on Wednesday to a Brooklyn team that had won three in a row. Golden State seemed poised for a franchise-record 11th straight victory when it took a 32-16 first-quarter lead. However, the Warriors were outscored 37-20 in the second. They were 3 of 14 from 3-point range after halftime and 0 for 5 following Klay Thompson's 3 with 4:06 remaining. "Certainly a tough loss," coach Mark Jackson said. "Disappointed that we did not finish it the right way. Give them credit. It was a great job by them, but we will not lose sight of the fact that we were 6-1 on this road trip." As good as the Warriors have been on the road of late, they're 11-4 and have won four of five at home, where they'll play seven of their next nine. Stephen Curry scored 34 points against the Nets, but he's struggling with his long-range shooting, going 6 of 33 from beyond the arc over the last four games. He scored 25 in a 94-86 loss at Boston on March 1 even though he was 6 of 22 from the field. The Celtics could be an ideal matchup for Curry, though, as they've allowed an average of 119.7 points in the first three games of their five-game trip. Boston has been particularly bad in the first half of those three contests, giving up 64.3 points. The Celtics (13-23) are in danger of going winless on the challenging trip that concludes in Portland on Saturday. They were knocked off by former coach Doc Rivers for the second time this season in a 111-105 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday. Boston trailed by 16 in the first and fourth quarters but outscored the Clippers 21-11 to end the game. "I mean, it takes a lot of energy, but that's what we had to do," said guard Jordan Crawford, who scored 24 points but committed five turnovers. "We dug ourselves in a hole. It was our fault that we were down, so we wanted to fight and get back in the game." Crawford is shooting 35.0 percent during the six-game skid and has gone 4 for 26 from 3-point range. Golden State's David Lee has averaged 23.0 points and shot 61.7 percent in his last 13 games, but he's made 45.7 percent in his last six matchups with Boston. The Warriors have lost four of five in the series, though the win came at home by a 101-83 score last Dec. 29. Copyright 2014 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
