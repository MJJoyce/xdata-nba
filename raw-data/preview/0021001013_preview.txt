76ers-Clippers Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Mar 15 2011 2:00PM A pair of losses to begin a five-game road trip didn't help the Philadelphia 76ers in their battle for sixth place in the Eastern Conference. They'll look to get back on track by regaining their recent road form when they face the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night. Philadelphia (34-33) hasn't endured a three-game skid since Nov. 23-26 - a slump that dropped it to 3-13. The Sixers, though, have since surged into a comfortable lead for seventh place and has been pushing New York for sixth. Philadelphia, though, has lost three of four since a three-game win streak. The Sixers had won seven of nine road contests going into this five-game trip, but fell 102-74 to Milwaukee - setting a season low for points - Saturday and lost 112-107 in overtime to Utah on Monday. Philadelphia rallied from 15 down in the fourth quarter to force OT, but shot 2 of 9 in the extra period. "We had a hangover from that Milwaukee game," coach Doug Collins said. "... I told our guys after the game if there's anything we learned is that if we're not blue-collar tough and give great effort all the time we can't beat anybody." The 76ers fell to 4-8 on the road versus Western Conference opponents. "We've been playing well," guard Lou Williams said after scoring 22 points Monday. "We've had some slippage losing two in a row and with the playoff push coming down this last stretch, we just gotta catch ourselves and hopefully we'll get back on track in L.A." Philadelphia had lost two straight to the Clippers (26-42) before Andre Iguodala and Jrue Holiday combined for 44 points to lift the Sixers to a 105-91 victory Dec. 15. Former Clipper Elton Brand added 15 points. Philadelphia will be taking on a Los Angeles team that has won five of seven and is opening a four-game homestand. The Clippers went 3-2 on a just-completed trip but couldn't close it out with a victory, falling 105-82 to Memphis on Monday. Rookie star Blake Griffin, one of four players averaging at least 20.0 points and 10.0 rebounds, was held to a season-low eight points along with nine boards. "Every loss is disappointing, but to lose the way we did was very disappointing," Griffin said after the Clippers dropped to 6-31 when scoring fewer than 100 points. "I just never got into a rhythm personally. I missed some easy ones. We were just kind of out there." Los Angeles should be very happy to be home, having played 17 of its last 20 on the road. The Clippers have gone 11-2 while averaging 105.2 points in their last 13 at Staples Center. Griffin is third in the NBA with 54 double-doubles, but has failed to record one in a season-high four straight games. He had 20 points and 18 rebounds versus the 76ers in December. The Clippers hope rookie guard Eric Bledsoe can continue his outstanding play in place of Eric Gordon, who missed his fifth consecutive game due to a right wrist injury and is unlikely to be available Wednesday. Bledsoe, averaging 7.2 points, had a season-high 23 points, eight rebounds and six assists in a 122-101 win over Washington on Saturday, then scored 19 on Monday. Gordon is averaging 23.7 points. The Clippers have lost 18 of 25 without him in the lineup. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
