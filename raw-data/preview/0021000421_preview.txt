Cavaliers-Hawks Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Dec 21 2010 4:35PM The Atlanta Hawks continue to thrive at home due in large part to their much-improved effort on the defensive end of the court. Looking for a third straight win over the struggling Cleveland Cavaliers, the Hawks try for a season-best eighth consecutive victory at Philips Arena on Wednesday night. After allowing 99.8 points over its first eight home games, Atlanta (18-12) has held opponents to 91.9 on 41.6 percent shooting over the seven-game run. The Hawks limited Orlando to 35.2 percent shooting - an opponent season low - in their 91-81 victory Monday night while Al Horford led the way with a team-best 24 points and 11 rebounds. Josh Smith had 12 points and 10 boards, and he also added three blocks as the Hawks improved to 15-4 when he registers at least two. After falling 89-82 to last-place New Jersey on Sunday, Smith knows the danger in overlooking a slumping club such as the Cavaliers, who have lost 11 of 12 and 11 straight on the road. "I wish we could get revved up for everybody else like we get revved up for Orlando and other good teams with good records," said Smith, who was held to six points in a 100-88 win at Cleveland on Nov. 2. Joe Johnson scored 17 against the Magic and is averaging 15.7 points on 33.3 percent shooting over three games following an early return from surgery to remove loose cartilage in his shooting elbow. Cleveland is on the verge of recording its longest road slide since dropping 13 in a row Oct. 29-Dec. 15, 2003. The Cavaliers (8-20) defeated New York 109-102 in overtime Saturday to snap a 10-game losing streak before falling 101-90 to Utah on Monday night despite making a season-best 12 3-pointers. "For me, and hopefully for the guys in that locker room, losing is always frustrating. I don't like it. I don't enjoy it," coach Byron Scott said. "I can deal with it because we are going to continue to get better. I know the guys in that locker room will continue to give me that same effort." After scoring 11 points on 4-of-20 shooting against the Knicks, Daniel Gibson made 7 of 8 from beyond the arc en route to a career-high 29 points. "I'm not real big on personal things. If it results in a win, then I'm excited about it," said Gibson, who is shooting 63.0 percent from 3-point range over his previous six games. "If we are not winning, then for me, I just want to figure out what we need to do in order to win our next game." Gibson and the Cavs may want to take a lesson from the Hawks and start on defense, as they are surrendering 102.9 points per game - 107.9 on the road. Cleveland is 3-17 when allowing 100 or more points. Mo Williams scored 16 points and dished out 10 assists against the Jazz. He is averaging 20.3 points and 11.6 assists in his last three games. Cleveland had taken five straight from Atlanta before falling in the previous two meetings. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
