Bucks-76ers Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Nov 11 2012 10:30PM After a perfect road trip, the Philadelphia 76ers are hoping to carry that momentum back home. The Milwaukee Bucks, meanwhile, are going for their best start on the road in 11 years. Philadelphia seeks a fourth straight win overall and its eighth in nine home contests against the Bucks on Monday night in the opener of a five-game homestand. Coming off two straight losses to New York, the 76ers (4-2) rebounded by sweeping three consecutive road games behind a defense that held opponents to 81.7 points and 40.2 percent shooting. "I'm thrilled, 3-0 road trip," coach Doug Collins said. Collins was certainly pleased with his reserves after the four-man bench held a 38-12 scoring edge and 17-10 rebounding advantage in Saturday's 93-83 victory at Toronto. Nick Young scored 16 points off the bench one day after the starters accounted for 82 points in a 106-100 win over Boston. "Our first unit just didn't have any juice at all," Collins said. "Our second unit was fantastic and that was the difference in the game. "That's what we're going to have to do, because we have 22 back-to-backs this year." Philadelphia's depth will continue to be tested with centers Andrew Bynum (knee) and Kwame Brown (calf) and swingman Jason Richardson (ankle) sidelined. The 76ers may need to withstand all those absences again as they open their first homestand after playing four of their first six games as visitors. They took two of three from the Bucks (3-2) last season, including a 94-82 victory Jan. 16 to extend their home winning streak in the series to three games. Philadelphia has won seven of the last eight meetings at Wells Fargo Center, holding Milwaukee to 86.0 points and 25.9 percent from 3-point range. The Bucks, though, are trying to begin a season 3-0 on the road for the first time since winning the first four games in 2001-02. They're averaging 100.0 points and shooting 48.8 percent from the field in the first two road contests. Their accuracy wasn't nearly that good in Saturday's 96-92 home loss to Boston, shooting 39.8 percent overall and connecting on only 3 of 19 from beyond the arc. Milwaukee will need much more from Brandon Jennings after the point guard was held to a season-low four points on 1-of-11 shooting against the Celtics. Jennings scored seven points on 3 off 11 from the field in his last game at Philadelphia, but did total 52 points and 13 assists in the two subsequent matchups at home. Leading scorer Monta Ellis has had more success playing on the road against the 76ers, averaging 21.4 points in five games. He leads the Bucks with 21.2 points per game after scoring a season-high 32 Saturday. Samuel Dalembert is also coming off his best performance of the season, scoring 14 points and pulling down eight boards. He totaled eight points over the previous four games. The center had 13 points and 19 boards in a win with Sacramento in only appearance as a visitor in Philadelphia on March 27, 2011. He spent his first eight seasons with the 76ers before being dealt to the Kings following the 2009-10 season. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
