76ers-Suns Preview By MATT BECKER Posted Dec 28 2010 5:09PM Although they're in a bit of a funk, Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns still boast one of the league's most potent offenses. These kinds of fast-paced systems have routinely given the Philadelphia 76ers fits. Nash may have Vince Carter as a teammate for the first time Wednesday night when the Suns try to avoid a fourth straight loss in a matchup with the 76ers. Nash had 21 points and 15 assists Sunday against the Los Angeles Clippers, but it wasn't enough as Phoenix lost 108-103, its seventh defeat in nine games. The Suns (13-16) hope opening a stretch of five of six games at the US Airways Center can help keep them from losing four in a row for the first time since Jan. 13-18. The Suns swept the two-game series from the 76ers last season, and have won 20 of the last 23 meetings in Phoenix. Nash averaged 20.5 points and 16.5 assists against Philadelphia last season, as the Suns averaged 112.5 points on 52.1 percent shooting. Nash and the Suns prefer to push the ball up the court, averaging 107.4 points, and this could spell trouble for the 76ers. Philadelphia (12-19) struggled against uptempo Golden State on Monday in losing 110-95, falling to 0-14 when allowing at least 99 points. "Tonight was one of those games where we were a step slow," 76ers coach Doug Collins said. "When you're a step slow against a team like this, then you're chasing." Jrue Holiday had 23 points and 11 assists on Monday for Philadelphia, which lost for the third time in five contests on its season-high eight-game road trip. It could be tough for the Sixers to win again on this lengthy trek, considering their recent troubles in Phoenix and with games remaining against the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday and New Orleans on Monday. The Lakers and Hornets are a combined 23-7 at home. Although Philadelphia had trouble keeping up with Golden State, it was without Andre Iguodala (right Achilles), Jason Kapono (sore calf), Lou Williams (personal) and Brian James (personal). Iguodala, who is averaging 14.2 points and 5.5 rebounds, and Williams, scoring 11.8 points, could both be back for this game. Iguodala averaged 22.0 points on 62.1 percent shooting against the Suns last season. Phoenix is also hoping to be a bit closer to full strength. Carter has missed all four games for the Suns since being acquired in a six-player trade with Orlando on Dec. 18 because of a sore left knee. The eight-time All-Star, who turns 34 on Jan. 26, could finally see some playing time against the 76ers, whom he averaged 17.0 points in four games against last season. While Carter was the biggest name coming to Phoenix in that blockbuster trade, Mickael Pietrus might be the most dynamic scorer acquired in that deal. After scoring two points in 13 minutes in his Suns debut against Miami on Thursday, Pietrus finished with a season-high 25 points and hit 5 of 8 from 3-point range against the Clippers. "We thought he would be able to play for us like that," Suns coach Alvin Gentry said. "He's an excellent shooter. But more than anything, I liked his toughness on the defensive end."
