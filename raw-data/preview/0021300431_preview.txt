Wizards-Timberwolves Preview By TAYLOR BECHTOLD Posted Dec 26 2013 1:41PM The Washington Wizards are on the brink of their longest road winning streak in nearly six years, though they haven't had much success in Minnesota. That could change if they continue their scoring surge against the defensively-challenged Timberwolves. Washington will try to earn a sweep of its four-game trip Friday night by winning for only the third time in its last 13 games in Minneapolis. The Wizards (12-13) matched a season high with four consecutive losses prior to heading out on the road, but they've managed to turn things around during this swing. After Bradley Beal hit a go-ahead layup with six seconds left in a 102-101 win in New York on Dec. 16, Washington pulled out a 113-107 victory across the river in Brooklyn on Dec. 18 and a 106-99 win at Boston on Saturday. Trevor Ariza poured in a game-high 27 points to help the Wizards rally from an 18-point deficit against the Celtics. "We don't let anything rattle us too much," said Ariza, who missed a 104-100 home win over Minnesota on Nov. 19 due to a sprained right hamstring. "We just play and chip away and know things are going to happen." Since averaging 95.3 points on 43.1 percent shooting while dropping eight of their first 11 on the road, the Wizards have scored 107.0 per game with a 47.8 field-goal percentage - including 31 of 59 from 3-point range - in their last three. They should be able to continue that production against Minnesota, which ranks near the bottom of the league in defensive scoring (102.7) and field-goal percentage (47.5). John Wall has played well on the trip, averaging 20.3 points on 45.1 percent shooting. He had scored 13.3 per game and shot 31.5 percent in his previous three away from home. Wall finished with 14 points on 5-of-17 shooting but matched a career high with 16 assists in the first meeting with Minnesota. Beal had 25 points, while former Wolves player Martell Webster added 17 with nine rebounds and five 3-pointers. With a rare road victory in this series, the Wizards can win four straight away from home for the first time since the 2007-08 season. They haven't won in Minnesota since March 9, 2009, dropping their last three games there. The Timberwolves (13-15) are seeking their third consecutive home win and ninth in 13 games, though they've lost two straight and four of six overall following Sunday's 120-116 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers at Staples Center. Leading by four with 18 seconds left in regulation, Minnesota couldn't hold on after Kevin Martin committed a huge turnover and the Clippers' Jamal Crawford sank a pair of clutch baskets to force overtime. "We just played so hard for something like that to go down," said Martin, who had 16 points but only has two 3-pointers in his last four. "But we'll bounce back from it." Kevin Love did his part with a season-high 45 points while tying a season best with 19 rebounds. Since missing one game due to personal reasons, he's averaged 31.3 points and gone 27 of 60 from 3-point range over his last eight. Love has posted a double-double in all eight career meetings with the Wizards after finishing with 25 points, 11 rebounds and four 3s in last month's loss. Nikola Pekovic had a career-high 34 points with 14 boards Sunday, though he missed a couple big shots at the end of regulation and overtime. He's averaged 28.7 points and 12.0 rebounds in his last three contests. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
