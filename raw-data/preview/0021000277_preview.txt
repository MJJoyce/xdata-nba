Trail Blazers-Wizards Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Dec 03 2010 12:08AM The way Portland has struggled, not even a matchup with the lowly Washington Wizards will guarantee the Trail Blazers' season-high skid will come to an end. Trying to avoid their sixth straight loss, the Trail Blazers look to hand the Wizards their fifth consecutive defeat Friday night. Though Portland (8-10) showed some life during a 99-95 loss at Boston on Wednesday, the Blazers have averaged 88.4 points on 40.4-percent shooting over the last five games. Portland has not lost six straight since dropping the final eight of the 2005-06 season. "We've got to play ball," swingman Wesley Matthews told the Trail Blazers' official website. "We've got to fight back." Portland earned a bit of a moral victory by outscoring Boston 23-20 in the fourth quarter after totaling 29 in the final periods of their previous two games at Philadelphia and New Jersey. "We need to build off of this," Blazers coach Nate McMillan said. "I really like the fact that we kept fighting and gave ourselves a chance to win this game." Portland, however, could have trouble building on its latest effort. The Blazers have already lost to the Nets and 76ers - teams with a combined 11 wins - heading into the finale of this four-game swing, and averaged 93.8 points while losing four of six on the road to the Wizards (5-12). The presence of Matthews could help Portland reverse its fortunes in Washington. The second-year pro scored 23 points Wednesday, and has averaged 24.7 on 26-of-43 shooting the last three games. Teammate LaMarcus Aldridge has averaged 20.4 points in the last seven games overall, and 19.4 with 9.6 rebounds in seven career contests versus Washington. Even with star rookie John Wall back after missing two games with a bruised right knee, the Wizards allowed their most points of the season in a 127-108 loss at Toronto on Wednesday. "Just an embarrassing effort," coach Flip Saunders said. "It's just very disappointing." Washington's opponents have averaged 112.8 points and shoot 48.9 percent while handing the Wizards five losses in six games. "It's disappointing," guard Kirk Hinrich said. "We're very frustrated right now with our inability to go out there and perform and put forth a winning effort." Wall finished with 19 points, but foot and knee problems have kept the No. 1 overall pick sidelined in six of the last nine games. After averaging 25.0 points in his previous three games, Gilbert Arenas totaled seven on 1-of-10 shooting against the Raptors. Arenas has averaged 23.2 points in his last six games against the Blazers but has not faced them since March 2007. Though the Wizards are 0-9 on the road, they are 5-3 at home and have won three of four at the Verizon Center. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
