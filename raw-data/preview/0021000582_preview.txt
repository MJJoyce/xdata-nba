Hornets-Rockets Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 14 2011 12:31AM Following two impressive wins, the New Orleans Hornets are hoping to avoid a letdown during an easy stretch of their schedule. The Hornets head to the Toyota Center on Friday night in search of a fifth consecutive win over the Southwest Division-rival Houston Rockets in the first of four straight games against opponents currently with losing records. Three nights after a 96-87 win in Denver, New Orleans (23-16) defeated Orlando 92-89 in overtime Wednesday thanks in part to a surprising performance from reserve Marcus Thornton. Thornton scored a season-high 22 points - including seven of the Hornets' 11 in the extra period. He had played sparingly in his four previous contests, but was brought into the game after Marco Belinelli sprained his right ankle just over a minute after tipoff. "Marcus came in and played phenomenal," said center Emeka Okafor, who had 18 points and 14 rebounds. "Marcus came in off the bench and does what he does best, which is score." The Hornets, who rank second in the league with 92.2 points allowed per game, held the Nuggets and Magic to a combined 39.8 percent shooting from the floor. "Those are really good numbers but it's something we can't be satisfied with because the problem we've had this year is we'll have a really good game like (Wednesday) night and then we'll go to Houston and not defend," said assistant coach Mike Malone. Chris Paul recorded 12 points and 13 assists against Orlando for his 18th double-double. He has averaged 26.5 points in his last two meetings with Houston. David West has also enjoyed success versus the Rockets, against whom he is averaging 26.8 points - 10.6 more than his career mark - during his last five games. He scored a career-high 44 and Paul had a triple-double with 16 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a 108-100 loss in Houston on Dec. 29, 2009. Rookie coach Monty Williams was pleased with the victory over the Magic, but wants to see his team display the same intensity going forward. "The test for us is winning a game like (the one against Orlando) and then having the same sense of urgency if not more going into these next games," he said. The Hornets visit Charlotte on Saturday before hosting Toronto and Memphis. New Orleans is averaging 107.8 points on 49.2 percent shooting during its four-game run against Houston (17-22). Belinelli, who has started all 39 games and is averaging a career-high 11.0 points, is uncertain to play Friday. Houston is hoping to get its leading scorer back after falling 118-112 to Oklahoma City on Wednesday with Kevin Martin on the sidelines. Martin, who averages 23.2 points per game, sat out his second consecutive contest with a sore right wrist. His status for Friday is unclear. The Rockets are surrendering 108.8 points during a 2-7 stretch, and the defensive woes are starting to take their toll. "We don't have a lot of margin for error," said forward Luis Scola, who scored 31 against the Thunder. Scola is second on the team in scoring with 19.4 points per game, but is averaging only 10.9 in 13 games against the Hornets. He scored only nine points, but pulled down 16 rebounds in the Rockets' 107-99 home loss to New Orleans on Nov. 3.
