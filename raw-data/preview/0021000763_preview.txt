Bulls-Trail Blazers Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Feb 07 2011 1:22AM With their six-game winning streak snapped, the Chicago Bulls will look to bounce back with a better all-around effort against the Portland Trail Blazers. They haven't had many strong efforts in Portland lately. The Bulls hope to avoid their fourth consecutive loss at the Rose Garden and their 10th in 12 visits when they continue their five-game road trip versus the  Blazers on Monday night. Chicago (34-15) had limited opponents to 84.3 points per game and 40.3-percent shooting during its six-game winning streak, which came to an end Saturday night with a 101-90 loss at Golden State. The Bulls, who dropped to 2-10 when surrendering more than 100 points, need to clamp down on defense if they want to slow down Portland, which has averaged 112.7 points during its three-game home winning streak in the series. Chicago has lost the last two by an average of 33.0 points Derrick Rose went 6 of 15 from the floor Saturday to finish with 14 points - his fewest since scoring a season-low six Dec. 15. "I couldn't get a feel for the game because they didn't let me," said Rose, who had scored at least 20 points in each of his previous 10 games. "I couldn't get to the hole. It was hard but I'll figure it out. It's just something we have to look at on film and see who's the open guy." Carlos Boozer, who missed a 110-98 home victory Nov. 1 over the Blazers due to a hand injury, had 21 points and 10 rebounds Saturday and is seeking a season-best fifth straight double-double. Fellow Chicago forward Luol Deng is likely looking forward to Monday, as he surpassed his previous career high of 38 points - which came in a 100-89 win March 26, 2007 against Portland - with a 40-point performance in the Nov. 1 win. The Blazers (27-24) return home after closing out their three-game trip Saturday with a 111-105 victory at Cleveland, handing the Cavaliers an NBA-record 24th consecutive loss. "There's pressure playing against every team, but, of course, there's added pressure with them struggling the way they are," said Portland point guard Andre Miller, who had 13 assists. "You don't want to be the top headline: 'Streak ends to Portland Trail Blazers.' Guys took a little pride in that." Wesley Matthews went 5 of 7 from 3-point range en route to 31 points while LaMarcus Aldridge registered his fourth double-double in five games with 20 points and 10 rebounds against the Cavs. Aldridge is averaging 29.7 points and shooting 63.8 percent during his last three matchups with the Bulls. Portland has dropped lost two of three overall home games while averaging 86.0 points - 9.5 below its season mark. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
