Timberwolves-Spurs Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Jan 08 2011 7:45PM The San Antonio Spurs needed to come from behind to avoid their first three-game losing streak of the season. They've experienced a pair of similar close calls this season against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Spurs look to beat the Timberwolves for the 15th straight time when the teams meet in San Antonio on Sunday night to open a home-and-home set. The Spurs' winning streak in this series is tied for the longest active run of domination in the NBA. Portland has also defeated Minnesota 14 straight times, and Dallas has a 14-game winning streak against Miami. San Antonio (30-6) took the first 12 games of this streak by an average of 12.9 points, but has struggled in both matchups this season. The Spurs were down by 11 at the end of the third quarter of an eventual 113-109 overtime victory Nov. 24, and trailed by 15 entering the fourth of a 107-101 win Dec. 3. "That's what good teams do," Minnesota coach Kurt Rambis said after last month's meeting. "Good teams have the confidence that they're going to come back and win. They know how to dig themselves out of holes." The Spurs dug themselves out of another hole Friday night at Indiana, outscoring the Pacers 26-12 in the final 12 minutes to turn an 11-point deficit into a 90-87 victory - their league-leading 30th. "They just kept playing the game," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "That's a great sign. We've done that several times this year. That's what a team really needs to sustain in this league. We're fortunate to get that win (Friday)." Manu Ginobili, who went a season-worst 1 of 10 from the field versus Minnesota in December, had a game-high 25 points Friday. Tim Duncan had 15 and 15 rebounds for his 14th double-double - all coming in San Antonio victories. The Timberwolves (9-28) are seeking to avoid a fourth consecutive loss. After blowing an eight-point lead with less than three minutes remaining in a 108-105 overtime loss to undermanned Charlotte on Wednesday, the Timberwolves trailed by as many as 24 before falling 108-98 to Portland on Friday night. "The last two games, it's been a little lackadaisical and nonchalant," said Michael Beasley, who scored 28 in last month's loss to the Spurs. "You can't do that, especially in the position we're in trying to win every game we can." While the Timberwolves continue to falter, Kevin Love hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. He had 30 points and 19 rebounds versus the Trail Blazers for his 23rd consecutive double-double. Love, averaging 23.5 points and 16.8 rebounds during that run, has averaged 28.5 points and 20.0 boards in the season series with the Spurs. Defensive specialist Corey Brewer, is likely to make his fourth start of the season Sunday. He leads the Wolves with 1.6 steals per game. Minnesota is 2-18 on the road, where it is allowing 111.0 points per game - tied with Phoenix for the most in the NBA. The Timberwolves haven't won in San Antonio since Jan. 14, 2004, a 100-93 victory in which Duncan had 36 points and 20 rebounds in a losing effort. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
