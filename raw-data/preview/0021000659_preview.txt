A matchup with the lowly Minnesota Timberwolves could change how he feels. The Rockets look to avoid a third straight loss Monday night when they will try to win their 13th straight over Minnesota and sixth in a row on the road in this matchup. After holding their previous two opponents to 86.5 points on 43.1 percent shooting, the Rockets (20-25) have struggled in the last two, surrendering a season-worst 72 points in the paint in Friday's 115-110 loss at Memphis before Orlando shot 52.9 percent against them in a 118-104 home loss Saturday. "Obviously, I'm disappointed with our effort. I can't remember a game that we've had like that," said Adelman, whose team has yielded 110 or more points in seven of the last 15 games. "... We've got to get back to the drawing board. Got a game against Minnesota Monday that we've got to get ready for." While the Rockets are among the worst in the league in scoring defense (104.7 points per game) and field goal defense at 46.9 percent, Adelman's club should enter this matchup with plenty of confidence. Houston has won the previous 12 against Minnesota by an average of 15.7 points, holding the Timberwolves to 43.0 percent shooting in these games. The Rockets limited the Timberwolves to 37.4 percent shooting in a 120-94 rout Nov. 7 for their first win this season as Luis Scola scored 24 points and Kevin Martin added 21. Additionally, Minnesota is trying to bounce back from its Western Conference-worst 21st road loss following a 126-111 defeat Wednesday to the Los Angeles Clippers. "We're not necessarily the (Washington) Wizards (0-20 on the road), but we're definitely not the cream of the crop when it comes to winning on the road," Kevin Love said after totaling 26 points and 11 rebounds for his 29th straight double-double. The Timberwolves (10-33), who play five of seven at Target Center, are a respectable 8-12 at home, but coach Kurt Rambis said he needs a better full-game effort from his team, which is committing a league-worst 17.1 turnovers per game and allowing an average of 108.4 points, also an NBA high. Love has been a bright spot as the league leader in double-doubles (38) and rebounds per game with 15.6, but the third-year forward hasn't been able to carry the Timberwolves to many wins. Minnesota has six victories during Love's double-double streak. "I'd rather be in (Blake Griffin's) shoes right now," Love said of the Clippers rookie, whose team has seven more wins than the Timberwolves. Love had 16 points and 16 rebounds in the Nov. 7 loss, while teammate Michael Beasley added 15 points. With starting center Darko Milicic questionable with a sprained left ankle and backup Nikola Pekovic - who had 11 points and a career-best 12 rebounds in the Nov. 7 loss - missing Wednesday's game with flu-like symptoms, Minnesota will likely need a big effort from Love and Beasley against Scola and Chuck Hayes. Scola scored 25 with a career-high 21 boards in the teams' last matchup at Target Center - a 112-98 Rockets victory March 6. Minnesota's last win versus Houston was at home, 103-99 in overtime Jan. 7, 2007. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
