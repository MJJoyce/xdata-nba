Hawks-Bucks Preview By NICOLINO DIBENEDETTO Posted Dec 26 2010 11:12PM Earl Boykins may be a journeyman guard, but he is more than keeping the Milwaukee Bucks afloat during the extended absence of Brandon Jennings. Boykins looks for another big effort as the Bucks seek a third consecutive win Monday night at home against the Atlanta Hawks. Milwaukee (12-16) appeared to be in serious trouble when Jennings was ruled out for up to six weeks after undergoing foot surgery last Monday. The injury left the Bucks without their point guard and team leader with averages of 17.9 points and 5.5 assists. A 12-year veteran who has played for nine teams, the 5-foot-5 Boykins has softened the blow of Jennings' absence with a sudden increase in scoring and playing time. He's helped Milwaukee in position for its third three-game winning streak of the season. Boykins scored 19 points while playing a season-high 29:03 in an 84-79 victory at Sacramento on Thursday. That performance came two nights after he had a season-best 22 points in a stunning 98-79 upset of the two-time reigning NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers. He totaled 53 points over his first 16 games of 2010-11, while never taking more than eight shots. "My teammates have confidence in me. They were willing to give me the ball," Boykins said after going 9 for 17 from the field Thursday. "They were setting great screens for me and that's how I was getting open. Coach is going to play guys who are playing well. I just happened to be playing well, but the difference was defense." The Bucks, allowing 92.6 points per game, rank among the NBA's top best defensive teams. However, that success has been undermined by scoring a league-low 91.2 points per contest. Milwaukee is 1-6 when opponents top 100 points. With Jennings out for an extended period, the Bucks are hoping Corey Maggette (concussion-like symptoms) and Drew Gooden (plantar faciitis) can return from injuries after missing three and two games, respectively. Maggette made 7 of 8 shots for 20 points while Boykins had seven in a 108-91 win at Atlanta on Nov. 10. The Hawks have dropped their last five road games, including an 93-86 loss to New Orleans on Sunday to open a stretch of six games out of seven away from home. Atlanta last lost six consecutive road games March 17-April 7, which included a 98-95 defeat at Milwaukee on March 22. The Hawks won 104-96 in their last visit to the Bradley Center on April 12. A better performance from Al Horford would help Atlanta's cause. Horford, who leads the Hawks with averages of 16.6 points and 9.6 rebounds, struggled to finish with eight points and six boards Sunday against the Hornets. Horford had 14 points and six rebounds versus Milwaukee last month. Copyright 2010 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
