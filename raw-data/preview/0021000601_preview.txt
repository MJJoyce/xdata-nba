The Bobcats could have an easier time scoring Monday in Philadelphia but might have more concerns with stopping the 76ers' resurgent offense. Charlotte is 6-4 since Silas took over for Larry Brown on Dec. 22 and had won a season-high four straight before falling 99-94 at Boston on Friday night. The next evening, the Bobcats (15-23) lost 88-81 at home to New Orleans. Charlotte shot 40.6 percent against the Hornets, who are giving up 92.2 points per game this season - only slightly little more than the Celtics (92.0). Tyrus Thomas was ejected after elbowing New Orleans center Emeka Okafor, and leading scorer Stephen Jackson picked up his first technical foul in a month during a 5-for-15 shooting performance. "There's just too much nonsense going on out there as far as going after the referees and all that kind of thing," Silas said. "It's like I told the players, 'You didn't see (New Orleans) going after the referees.' "Why? Because they understand, 'My job is to go out and play the game and concentrate on those particular things.' We just aren't there yet." Thomas was given a one-game suspension by the league Monday and will miss this game. Charlotte has won seven of 10 over the 76ers (16-23) and split its past four games in Philadelphia after losing seven of its first eight there. The Bobcats, though, will have to contend with a 76ers team that's averaging 104.2 points in its last five games - 8.2 more than in its previous 34. Charlotte had trouble stopping Philadelphia in a 109-91 road loss Dec. 4. The 76ers, who shot 51.9 percent in that win, scored over 100 points in consecutive defeats to sub-.500 Detroit and Indiana, but Louis Williams scored 25 points to hold on for a 95-94 win over visiting Milwaukee on Friday night. "We could have been close to .500," forward Elton Brand said. "But we got this one." Williams, averaging 19.4 points in his last five games, hit the go-ahead 3-pointer with 43 seconds left. Andre Iguodala also had 15 points after scoring one on 0-of-7 shooting in his return from a sore Achilles' tendon, and Philadelphia shot a season-high 57.1 percent. "Lou makes us a different team when he's playing well and with Iguodala back, it gets us a lot of options," coach Doug Collins said. Iguodala also had 15 points in the win over Charlotte in November, part of the 76ers' current 10-3 stretch at home. Jodie Meeks scored a career-high 26 and Thaddeus Young added 20 off the bench to help Philadelphia snap a three-game slide to the Bobcats. The 76ers are 9-3 at home all-time against Charlotte but trail 12-11 in the series. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
