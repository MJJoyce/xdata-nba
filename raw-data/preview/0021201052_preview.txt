76ers-Jazz Preview Posted Mar 25 2013 1:20AM The Utah Jazz continue to lose ground in the Western Conference playoff race while the Philadelphia 76ers finally found a way to stop losing on the road. The fading Jazz will try to avoid a season-high fifth straight defeat and extend a seven-game home win streak over the 76ers on Monday night. Utah (34-36) has dropped into a tie for ninth place in the West, two games behind the Lakers for the conference's final playoff spot. It's been over a month of bad basketball from the Jazz, who fell for the 12th time in 15 games with Sunday's 113-108 loss at Dallas. "We can't get the games back that we lost," coach Tyrone Corbin said. "We need to learn lessons from it. But we have to find a way to get better." Sunday's defeat was the ninth straight on the road for Utah, and Philadelphia (27-42) can relate. The 76ers finally ended a road skid that reached 15 with a 117-103 victory over Sacramento on Sunday. Philadelphia was enduring its longest road slide since a franchise-worst 20 straight such defeats in 1987-88. Now it will look to close a four-game trip with momentum after coming close to ending the losing streak in Thursday's 101-100 defeat in Denver. "It finally feels good to win on the road," coach Doug Collins said. "I'm so happy for our guys, especially the way they've bounced back after that tough, tough loss in Denver." The 76ers have lost seven straight in Salt Lake City and 21 of their last 23 there. Utah, however, returns home after an 0-3 trip that included the loss to the Mavericks. Dallas shot 54.3 percent - the worst mark yielded by the Jazz since the All-Star break. "I think we're just losing focus," said reserve Enes Kanter, who scored a team-high 17 points. "We'll just have to work on it and stick together." Jrue Holiday was brilliant Sunday for Philadelphia with 21 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and five steals. Dorrell Wright hit six 3-pointers and scored 21 points and Lavoy Allen added a career-high 20 points. "Our ace of spades were Dorrell and Lavoy and it was just a great, great win for us," Collins said. Allen's contribution was inexplicable as he totaled 15 points on 7-of-19 shooting over a six-game stretch before Collins didn't play him against the Nuggets. The second-year pro made 9 of 13 shots Sunday to match his second-highest total of the season. "I didn't play in the Denver game so I had to make up for the shot attempts I didn't get that game so I got some shots up and I was hitting," Allen said. Philadelphia won 99-93 at home over Utah on Nov. 16. Holiday had 26 points, seven assists and six rebounds. Paul Millsap led the Jazz with 22 points. Utah plays eight of its final 12 games at home, where it has dropped four of its last six to Eastern Conference opponents. "We're going to lay everything out there for 12 games and see what happens," Corbin said. Copyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
