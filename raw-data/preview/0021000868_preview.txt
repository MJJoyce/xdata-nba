Hornets-Timberwolves Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Feb 25 2011 12:14AM The Minnesota Timberwolves have the fewest wins in the Western Conference during a tumultuous season of many lows and very few highs. Two of those victories, though, have come against the New Orleans Hornets. While going for an NBA-record 45th consecutive double-double, Kevin Love also will try to lead the Timberwolves to a season sweep of the Hornets on Friday night in Minnesota. Love matched Moses Malone's mark set during the 1982-83 season by finishing with 15 points and 11 rebounds Wednesday in the Timberwolves' 104-95 loss to Memphis. It was the sixth straight defeat overall for Minnesota (13-45), which has also lost six in a row and 12 of 14 at the Target Center. Love didn't record his 10th rebound until 3:02 remained in the game and admitted the streak has been a distraction. "In some ways I was like, 'Okay, I want to tie this thing,' but in a lot of ways I was like, 'I just wish this thing would end so I could go out there and just start playing again,'" he told the league's official website. Love had 16 points and 11 rebounds Dec. 27 in a 113-98 home win over the Hornets. He then tallied 27 points with 17 boards Feb. 7 in a 104-92 victory in New Orleans. Love is in the top 20 the league with 20.9 points per game, and the NBA's leader with 895 rebounds - 118 more than second-place Dwight Howard of Orlando. "We need to play hard. I'm going out there every night playing extremely hard. I know that," Love said. "But it doesn't take one person. It takes everybody, and we need to go out there and try to get the job done by any means possible." Minnesota has not swept a season series from New Orleans since taking all four meetings in 2004-05. Michael Beasley shot only 5 of 17 and scored 14 points against Memphis, but had a team-high 30 with nine rebounds and seven assists versus the Hornets in December. Despite Minnesota's high-scoring output against New Orleans, the Timberwolves have averaged only 88.2 points over their last five games and 89.5 during their home losing streak. A low-scoring affair may play right into the hands of the Hornets, who have scored fewer than 100 in nine of their last 10. New Orleans (34-25) forced 13 turnovers and shot 51.3 percent - its highest since Jan. 26 - in a 98-87 victory Wednesday against the Los Angeles Clippers. "That's the kind of game we've been playing all year long," coach Monty Williams told the league's official website. "When we play ugly games like that, those games feel good to us." David West scored 22 points while Chris Paul added 19 and 10 assists. West has averaged 20.5 points and Paul has totaled 26 assists versus Minnesota in 2010-11. The win was the Hornets' third in 12 games after winning 10 straight from Jan. 9-26, dropping them into a tight race for one of the West's last four playoff spots. Carl Landry is expected to make his New Orleans debut after being acquired Wednesday from Sacramento for guard Marcus Thornton. Landry, who averages 11.9 points and 4.8 rebounds, should lend an inside presence that's been missing with Emeka Okafor out for the last 10 games with strained left hip.
