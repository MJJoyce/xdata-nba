Spurs-Wizards Preview By JEFF BARTL Posted Nov 25 2012 10:06PM As if things weren't already going terribly for the Washington Wizards, they'll now have to contend with a red-hot Tony Parker and the San Antonio Spurs. He'll look to help lead visiting San Antonio to a 13th consecutive victory over winless Washington on Monday night. The Spurs (11-3) got a game-high 32 points from Parker in a 111-106 double-overtime victory Sunday at Toronto, their third straight win. Parker, averaging 30.3 points and 7.0 assists while shooting 61.2 percent during the winning streak, scored six during the second OT. "It could've gone either way. We had to work for this one," Parker said. "In the second overtime it was close and they were switching the pick and rolls and I was just trying to get a rhythm." Tim Duncan added 26 points and is averaging 22.0 points and 12.8 rebounds over his last four. "He's our closer and he has been that way for the last couple of years," Duncan said of Parker. "He steps up and makes big shots for us. That's what we ask him to do and he's delivered for us." Each of San Antonio's wins during the streak have come in the midst of a six-game road trip, which doesn't seem to bother the NBA's best road team. Manu Ginobili scored 15 points Sunday for the Spurs, who are 7-1 away from home and will face Orlando on Wednesday before ending the trip with a showdown against Miami on Thursday. "We take pride in winning on the road," Ginobili said. San Antonio has won 11 of 12 against teams other than the Los Angeles Clippers, and it doesn't appear Washington will be the squad to slow it down. The Spurs have won 12 straight meetings after Parker hit 13 of 18 shots and scored 31 points in a 112-97 victory in the most recent matchup March 12. Washington's last win in the series came on Nov. 12, 2005, when Duncan shot 3 for 18. At this point, the Wizards would take a victory over any team. Their franchise-worst start hit 0-11 after a 108-106 double-overtime loss to Charlotte on Saturday. Martell Webster scored 21 points and Nene added 19 off the bench for Washington, which was coming off a 101-100 overtime defeat at Atlanta on Wednesday. "I don't know how many games we lost. I just know there were a couple games we were supposed to win," Nene said. The Wizards are the league's lowest-scoring team averaging 89.8 points, and coach Randy Wittman is putting the brunt of the blame on himself for the constant losing. Each defeat brings them closer to the worst start in NBA history, set by a New Jersey team that lost its first 18 games in 2009-10. "It's hard to win a game," Wittman said. "You have to make plays down the stretch. I thought we had three great looks, they just didn't go in. A lot of things - start of the game, start of third quarter. "That lies with me. I'm not pointing a finger at my players. Obviously, it lies with me, I know it lies with me and I need to figure a way out to get this righted. That's what my job is and I'll take full responsibility for that." San Antonio has won the last seven meetings by an average of 19.9 points. Copyright 2012 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
