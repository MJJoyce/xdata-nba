Cavaliers-Magic Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Jan 29 2011 9:28PM Cleveland coach Byron Scott is less worried about the historical significance of his team's current losing stretch and more concerned about finding a way to end the skid. The lowly Cavaliers look to avoid setting a single-season club record with their 20th consecutive loss Sunday night against the Orlando Magic. Even with a rematch against former favorite son LeBron James and the Heat on Monday in Miami, Cleveland (8-38) has no reason to look ahead while trying for its first victory since beating New York 109-102 in overtime Dec. 18. The Cavaliers tied a single-season franchise record with their 19th straight loss, and 29th in 30 games after falling 117-103 against Denver on Friday. The NBA record for most consecutive defeats in one season is 23 shared by Vancouver (1995-96) and Denver (1997-98). "I can care less about the record books as far as that is concerned," Scott told the Cavaliers' official website. "The one record I hope we start to do is 48 solid minutes of basketball. Not 36 or 24. Let's see if we can put a streak together where we can play 48 straight minutes of good basketball." That's been tough for a Cleveland team that's already lost starting center Anderson Varejao to a season-ending ankle injury and could be without guard Mo Williams a seventh straight game with a strained hip. Trying to string together four solid quarters the next two nights against Orlando (30-17) and Miami won't be easy as the Cavaliers try to avoid a 23rd straight road loss. Still, players are doing their best to remain optimistic. "I just hate losing," said forward J.J. Hickson, who had 24 points and 14 rebounds Friday. "It's a tough season for us and hopefully we can turn it around." That could be difficult against the Magic, who will be trying for a fifth consecutive win over the Cavaliers. Orlando shot 53.0 percent and outscored Cleveland by an average 13.0 points while winning the teams' two previous meetings this season. Antawn Jamison, who had 20 points with 12 rebounds against Denver, has totaled 43 points against Orlando in 2010-11. Though the Magic have fared well against Cleveland with or without James lately, they hope to play better than in Friday's 99-90 loss at Chicago. Despite 40 points and 15 rebounds from All-Star Dwight Howard, the Magic shot 41.0 percent and allowed 34 third-quarter points while falling to 5-5 since a season-high nine-game winning streak. Possibly making matters a little tougher, Orlando could be without point guard Jameer Nelson after he played just eight minutes Friday because of soreness in his right knee. If Nelson can't play, Gilbert Arenas could start. "I sort of worry about the things that I can control and I don't worry about the things that I can't control. (Nelson) will either be able to play or he won't," coach Stan Van Gundy told the Magic's official website. "Our defense worries me. As far as who will be healthy enough to play, they'll tell me and then we'll play the guys who are healthy." Though Arenas has averaged 7.4 points off the bench over the last 13 games, he scored a team-high 22 with 11 assists in Orlando's 110-95 win at Cleveland on Dec. 28.
