Bulls-Spurs Preview By NOEY KUPCHAN Posted Nov 17 2010 2:02AM Even with Tim Duncan struggling, the San Antonio Spurs aren't showing any signs of slowing down. The Spurs look to match the best 10-game start in franchise history when they host the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night. San Antonio is 8-1 for the first time since 2004-05, when it went on to win the third of its four NBA championships. With another victory Wednesday, the Spurs would match their starts from 1980 and 1981. Each time they've opened 8-1 or better, they have finished the season atop their division. "I really didn't expect to start like this," said Manu Ginobili, averaging a team-high 21.3 points. "The great thing is that we've been making a lot of shots. That's really helped." San Antonio is connecting on an NBA-best 44.0 percent of its 3-point attempts, and hit 11 of 20 from long distance in their 117-104 victory at Oklahoma City on Sunday. Matt Bonner, playing his second game since returning from an ankle injury he sustained in the season opener, went 7 for 7 from 3-point range, accounting for all 21 of his points off the bench. "We definitely have multiple weapons in the offense and it makes it really hard to guard us," Bonner said. Those multiple weapons are enabling the Spurs to thrive while Duncan struggles. The 12-time All Star and two-time league MVP has scored in single digits in three straight games for the first time in his career. He finished with six points against the Thunder. Duncan has scored at least 10 in all but one of his 24 career games against Chicago. He had 43 points in the two meetings last season, but that didn't help the Spurs avoid getting swept in their two-game series with the Bulls for the first time since 1997-98 - Duncan's rookie season. "We know how fast and talented (Derrick) Rose is, (Luol) Deng is playing great, (Joakim) Noah on the boards," Ginobili said. "They are young and athletic so we expect a lot of aggressiveness. The Bulls (6-3) kicked off their seven-game road trip with a 95-92 win at Houston on Tuesday night. They put on an impressive long-distance shooting display of their own, connecting on 8 of 12 3-pointers to win their first game away from home in three tries this season. "It's a great way to start the trip," said Noah, who had 12 points and nine rebounds. Rose scored 17 of his 33 in the fourth quarter, helping Chicago rally from eight down entering the final 12 minutes, and matched a career-high with four 3-pointers. He also had seven assists. "Whatever it takes for my team to win," Rose said. "I'm going to try to go out there and do it." Rose had 27 points in the Bulls' 98-93 victory at San Antonio on Jan. 25. Noah is pulling down 12.7 rebounds per game, second-best in the NBA, but has averaged only 4.8 in six games versus the Spurs. The Bulls, who went 15 for 28 from the free-throw line against the Rockets, will likely need a better effort to keep up with a Spurs team averaging 108.9 points - second-most in the league.
