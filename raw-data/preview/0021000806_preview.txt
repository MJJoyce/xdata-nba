Wizards-Cavaliers Preview By KATE HEDLIN Posted Feb 13 2011 1:18AM Nearly four months into the season, the Washington Wizards are still looking for their first road win. If any other team knows the emotions they're going through, it's the Cleveland Cavaliers. After snapping the longest losing streak in NBA history, the Cavaliers look to reach double digits in wins while extending the Wizards' misery on Sunday night. Earlier this week, Cleveland (9-45) and Washington (14-38) seemed destined to bring their respective lengthy slides into Quicken Loans Arena, but the Cavaliers spoiled that scenario by ending a 26-game skid with a 126-119 overtime victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday behind 35 points from Antawn Jamison. It was the Cavaliers' first win since Dec. 18, when they beat the Knicks in overtime in New York. "I can smile again," said Daniel Gibson, who scored nine points of his 17 points in overtime. "It feels pretty good. Winning is a precious feeling." Now, it's the Wizards looking to end their losing streak. Washington is 0-25 on the road this season and closing in on Dallas' NBA-worst 0-29 road start in 1992-93. "We're not giving in and we're not giving up," the Wizards' Andray Blatche said after the team's most recent road loss, 97-89 to New Orleans on Feb. 1. The Wizards have dropped seven straight in Cleveland by an average of 13.0 points, but Washington might find inspiration after the Cavaliers ended their woes. Besides a big game from Jamison, a former Wizard, guard Mo Williams played for the first time in nearly a month because of a hip injury and had 17 points and 14 assists. "He gave us a huge lift," Gibson said. "All game long he kept saying, 'We ain't losing this game.' We all had that feeling." For Jamison, this will be his first game against his former team since being dealt to Cleveland nearly one year ago. Jamison, who played 5 1/2 seasons with the Wizards, missed Cleveland's 107-102 win over Washington on Nov. 6 with a sore knee. While the Cavaliers look to build off a rare win, the Wizards fell for the ninth time in 10 games, 118-94 to league-leading San Antonio on Saturday. Washington trailed by 27 at halftime and by as much as 41. Blatche and Cartier Martin each scored a team-high 16 points, but the Spurs shot 58.4 percent and went 13 of 25 from 3-point range. The Wizards are allowing 108.5 points away from home this season. "You're as good as your last performance. Right now, we're not very good," coach Flip Saunders said. "We've got to get a lot better to compete with anybody in the NBA." Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
