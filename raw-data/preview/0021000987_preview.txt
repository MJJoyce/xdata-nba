Magic-Suns Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Mar 12 2011 7:49PM Orlando and Phoenix have played fairly well since their six-player trade in December. Meeting for the first time since that deal, the Suns try for a ninth consecutive home win over the Magic on Sunday afternoon. Neither team was playing great Dec. 18 when Orlando acquired Hedo Turkoglu, Jason Richardson and Earl Clark from the Suns for Vince Carter, Marcin Gortat, Mickael Pietrus, a 2011 first-round pick and cash. The Magic (41-25) were 16-9 before the deal and losers of five of six. After losing three straight, Orlando then reeled off nine consecutive victories to go 25-16 since the deal. Though Phoenix (33-30) is ninth in the West and one game out of the final playoff spot, it's 21-17 since the trade. Turkoglu and Richardson have started every game with Orlando, and while Carter's average is down from 15.1 points to 14.2 since the trade, he presents the Suns with a true scoring threat. Carter, however, does not want to make a big deal about this contest, especially with the Suns fighting for a playoff spot. "Of course I want to play well and that's a team that we need to beat, but it's just important as the Houston game after that," Carter told the Suns' official website. "When you're playing for a playoff spot, it has more to do with what you need to do more than what it says on their jersey." Gortat averaged just 4.0 points with the Magic, but 11.8 and 8.8 rebounds as one of the Suns' key reserves. He had 14 with 18 boards in a 116-97 loss to Denver on Thursday. "I wish (Orlando) good luck," Gortat said. "But this is my team and this is my family now. The last 30 games were the best of my life, and I don't want to change that." What both teams would like to change is the way they've played of late. Phoenix has lost three of five, and Orlando three of four. Though the Magic have not won at Phoenix since Nov. 14, 2001, they must find a way to bounce back after blowing a 21-point lead in Friday's 123-120 loss at Golden State. Orlando allowed the Warriors to make 21 of the game's NBA-record 36 combined 3-pointers and shoot 60.0 percent from beyond the arc. "If we can't defend the 3-point line any better, we'll get our (butts) kicked again," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. Richardson finished with 30 points and went 7 of 11 from 3-point range while Turkoglu added 24. Richardson has averaged 22.2 on 55.4 percent shooting the last five contests. While the Magic looks to end their longest current road skid against any team, Phoenix tries to regroup after its 12-game home winning streak against Denver ended Friday night. The Suns never led and shot 41.1 percent for the game. Nash played just 10 minutes in the second half because of a groin injury, which could leave his status uncertain for this contest. "Throw this one out the window," said Carter, who followed a 32-point effort in Tuesday's win over Houston with six points on 2-of-11 shooting Thursday. "The mentality has to be the game is over come Sunday for our next game." Nash, who missed the Suns' 105-89 loss at Orlando on Nov. 18 with a groin strain, has averaged 19.4 points and 12.6 assists the last five homes games versus Orlando.
