Raptors-Cavaliers Preview By JEFF MEZYDLO Posted Jan 05 2011 1:24AM The possible return of two starters and a visit from the Toronto Raptors could be what Cleveland needs to snap its latest skid. Last in the Eastern Conference, the Cavaliers hope to avoid an eighth consecutive loss by extending their home winning streak over the Raptors to 12 games Wednesday night. Though Cleveland's recent home dominance over Toronto came with superstar LeBron James in the lineup, that history of success against the Raptors could still be a means of motivation for the struggling Cavaliers. Cleveland (8-26) has lost 17 of 18 and been forced to deal with a rash of injuries to some key players lately. "It's always tough," coach Byron Scott said. "The whole situation we're in right now is tough." Things could get better if injured starters Anderson Varejao (broken cheekbone) and Daniel Gibson (bruised thigh) are able to return. Both missed the last two games, but practiced Tuesday. The 6-foot-11 Varejao, who will wear a protective mask, averages a team-leading 9.8 rebounds. Gibson, meanwhile, has averaged 14.5 points in 10 games since cracking the starting lineup Dec. 8. "We'll see how guys feel (Wednesday) morning and we'll go from there," Scott told the Cavaliers' official website. "I'm optimistic. I feel pretty good about it." Mo Williams returned from a two-game absence with a strained hip, but managed just five points on 2-of-11 shooting in Sunday's 104-95 loss to Dallas. Though he's averaged 17.8 points and 7.2 assists in his last six games against the Raptors, a groin injury forced him to miss the Cavaliers' 101-81 loss at Toronto on Oct. 29. Veteran Antawn Jamison has averaged 23.3 points on 52.9 percent shooting the last six games. He had a season-high 35 points with 10 rebounds against Dallas. Jamison is averaging 21.8 points in his career against the Raptors, but was held to a team-high 13 in October. Though the Raptors shot 47.6 percent in that contest, they've made 43.8 percent of their shots while averaging 94.9 points during their extended road skid against the Cavaliers dating to an 87-86 win April 6, 2004. Toronto's 11 straight losses in Cleveland matches the franchise's longest skid in any city. That doesn't bode well after the Raptors (11-23) lost their third in a row and 12th in 15 games, 111-91 at Chicago on Tuesday. "The little things, loose balls you have to get those," Raptors forward Amir Johnson said. Andrea Bargnani scored 23 points after missing four games with a sore calf, and DeMar DeRozan added 18 as Toronto fell to 4-13 on the road. The 7-foot Bargnani is averaging a career-high 21.3 points this season, but 10.9 in seven career games at Cleveland. It's uncertain if guard Jose Calderon will be in the Toronto lineup after missing Tuesday's contest with a sprained right ankle. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.
