D4eden::2-22 3pt shooting. That's why the Lakers lost this game.  4-22 and the Lakers win 105-103 and still have horrendous shooting night from beyond the arc.
Terry 1953::Dwight Howard only made 1 shot. Hey Lakers where in the hell did you dig this piece of crap from
asdbluecfl::Kobe Bryant 36 points 0 assists.
CoolDaddyPapa::I have never seen a ball hog worse than Kobe.  I don't see how other players of any talent can play with the guy.  He shoots a poor percentage, scores 30, and thinks he's the greatest.  He insists upon driving to the basket on breaks instead of passing to open players who could easily get a dunk.  instead he makes one of two free throws.  Sucks.
younged510::Philly's Coach," Here's the plan, Let Kobe shot all day, and defend the other guys, take away ball movement and don't double team Howard too much,cause that will leave open 3 point shots, and again LET KOBE BALL HOG ALL DAY!!.. you do this we can win the game."..    result 103-99, 76ers
dlo7astate::kobe 29 shots o ast thats why they lost
younged510::Lakers are garbage.. they won't make the playoff this year..
dennis580::Dominant game by Howard. 14 rebounds, and 5 blocks.
CoolDaddyPapa::dominant??? 14 boards is not dominant for a guy of his talent.
younged510::The day they got Howard I said "Shot they got a squad", then they got Nash, I said "yes! they don't have a true point guard again".. if you look at all of Kobe's Championship, it's with Derek Fisher.. Nash is not the same offensively, nor Defensively..  They should of got a real point guard.. if the Lakers could not stop B. Westbroke last year, what makes them think that Nash can guard these fast, powerful assist first, then play defense, and then take over and play their position as a real point guard is the answer to winning championship is the only way? eehhh!!! wrong!!! Get a solid PG and you'll be all right.. In a mean while, LETS GO WARRIORS!!!!!!!
KrayzieBone5150::Gasol 2-12 Howard 1-7 Metta 6-17 ---------------- 31 points &lt; Kobe's 36  Come on man even YOU STUPID idiots can see right here why the Lakers lost!!!  3rd Qrt Kobe said " I've seen enough time for me to go out shooting"
younged510::Philly's Coach," Here's the plan, Let Kobe shot all day, and defend the other guys, take away ball movement and don't double team Howard too much,cause that will leave open 3 point shots, and again LET KOBE BALL HOG ALL DAY!!.. you do this we can win the game."..  result 103-99, 76ers
Maralookslikethejoker::your a bigger $@%!$@% then the first one.

elezajac::As soon as you learn how to spell Kobe.

MJH5158::The ultimate team game is football.  NBA is the only league in which one player can win for  a team every single night.   See Lebron in Cleveland.  NBA is a garbage team sport.
VB 2 Raw::lol..a mamba, a lonlely predator that has no legs..most predaros will destroy a mamba..lets not talk about mongooses..so he picked an ambush solitary predator..but he play the ultimate team game..dr buss needs to get his son out of here,bring in a real coach and dump kobe kancer.
Daniela96124::"What's defense? What's an assist? I miss Shaq." - Kobrick Bryant
B-Rye721::Lakers had more points in the paint, more fast break points, less turnovers, and out rebounded Philly and still lost.  This is going to be a long year
Bamm7272::"Stern, thanks so much!"  - Chris Paul
The one and only rainmaker::Good News Bad News Laker fans Since firing Mike Brown, Lakers are 14-12   Bad news is they are 10-11 under Dantoni
Bamm7272::They got the roaming around .500 pat down.
jessica_rabbit17::Lol at faker losers......after getting Howard and Nash .....ring is ours gonna get 73 wins......reality.....after 5 games fire brown and are 15-16 worst start in history!!!fakers now there is always next year!!!!lmfao The lakers are 2 old,and Dwight has turned in to one if the worst trades in nba history!!!
elezajac::Yeah - seeing Bynum tear it up in Philly just reaks of it being a terrible trade.

The one and only rainmaker::Bryant is averaging 21.5 shots per game, while the Lakers' bigs are getting a combined 22.3 attempts per night.  And Kobe Slurpers dont see nothing with that??     The problem is not the Talent... It's the coaching. Coaches are afraid to stand up to Kobe or their coaching motto must be to give Kobe the ball and let him shoot..  If you misused your big men, they turn into Role players, not too different from Kwame Brown..  DHoward and Pau dont suck... It's the coaching that sucks...
VB 2 Raw::why does the coach have to tell kobe not to ball hog..he is a grown man,he will never understand teams win together..
Mesmartoday::Bring in James Worthy as coach.....sure to be some fireworks between Kobe and him.....
FrankPisFACTio211::Kobe is now 646 bricks away from passing Havlicek for most misses in NBA History.  He has to average 12.6 bricks per-game to accomplish this amazing feat by the end of this season.   Let's get it, Kobe!!
FrankPisFACTio211::Yes.
Mesmartoday::Havlicek was a heck of a player..isn't he one of the top 50?
blackmajik61::Jamison has shown that he can score in a variety of ways, inside, mid range and from the 3 pt line so how is it he doesn't "fit" in? I don't get it. You can thank the front office for royally screwing this thing up by hiring D'Antoni. Who knows maybe Jamison would've had the hot hand that night, I guess we'll never know. To come off the bench is understandable to not even be worth getting a single minute is unexplainable especially when your guys are struggling.
KissTheRings5::i like jamison but he plays no defense and cant rebound. PF's lick their chows and sprint to the post when he comes in the game
Mesmartoday::You could be right ...in fact to play this D'antoni pace the rotation of players needs to be expanded...all 12 should get some PT
Mesmartoday::Only 7 TO......yet still gave up 103....shot selection, shot selection, shot selection, PR was non existent with the bigs.
blackmajik61::Gasol, Artest, and Howard go a combined 9 for 36 but Jamison can't sniff the floor? C'mon man!
Chris31708::Boston Celtics in 2008- Lost 16 games total  LA Lakers in 2013- Lost 16 games the first 2 months of the season   ROFL!
Mesmartoday::3 - 22  shooting threes, recipe for a loss every time.
jimmiesjonesen::SO LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT THE ONLY TIME YOU CARE IS WHEN THE BULLY GETS BEAT UP AND FLAGS A POST?I COULD FLAG 200 POSTS A DAY AND WILL IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT?
