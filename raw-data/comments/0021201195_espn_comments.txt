Rezo201::.
THEBETTERANGLE::Toronto is now winning when it doesn't matter.
ConvicedSince06_JamesGang::***PSA***THIS BOARD IS NOW WHITE HOT.....AND THE HEAT IS ON.....BE VERY AFFRAID....THE PLAYOFFS ARE ALMOST HERE!!!
sjohnson2013_14::Derozan is on his way up.
itmakessense::Why is Reggie Evans getting 30 minutes of play in the NBA?
BXwarriorBX::16 reb? lopez is soft on the boards
oliver yerface::derozan has been my 3rd fav player since he's been in the league
Ontario925::Now the Raptors decide to play like NBA World beaters in the last few games of the Regular season when they face opponents like the Bulls and Nets who are fighting for higher Postseason seed on the line while the Raptors are playing with nothing to lose. Typical Toronto teams almost every year since 1995. They wait until the last week of the Regular season to look like World beaters when there is no Postseason seed pressure on them like the opponents they beat have. Actually Buffalo teams do the same thing often.
Cheloknowsbestisback::Reggie Evans is the best dang rebounder i've ever seen...he and rodman are from another planet
hamel89::Did Larry Fitzgerald go just to see Aaron Gray?
Mop8593::D-will has been lights out, JJ needs to step it up if bkn wants to do damage in the playoffs
ivandpc23::Deron Williams and Lopez do too much for this team, Johnson needs to step it up in the playoffs esp if he plays his old Hawks 1st rd.
streudelboy::Why bring up the Knicks record vs the raptors?  How did the nets fare against the heat?
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::They got blow out every game LOL.
bluedevils1148::Reggie Evans' stat line though.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::I might be behind on Miami Heat news (or be the only one without a strong opinion on them either way) but why do fans of other teams call them the Miami CHeat? When did they cheat? Or is it jealousy that they are so good?
KingJames6Swag::DABU knicks and heat fans aren't exactly smart
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Haha.
knicks_112ndcoming::cheat? really? havent heard that one..
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Oh god Denzio. That is the reason. Good lord. That is extreme jealousy hahah. Come on bro you are a Knick fan you are better than that.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Ya I have seen it floating around. Someone will trash talk a Heat fan by calling them a CHeat fan.
denzioKNICKS4lyf::Stern owns half of them, look LeFrown has no calls on his flops
lakhani47::matchup nets vs knicks  pg: D-will beats felton Sg: Jr smith(even though he doesnt start) beats joe johnson sf: carmelo rapes gerald wallace pf: evans beats martin C: even game
denzioKNICKS4lyf::nah, Felton's better than him he's fatter eh
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::It is a battle of the fat PGs when it is Felton vs Lowry for sure.
knicks_112ndcoming::https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=463806367025244&amp;set=pb.382650515140830.-2207520000.1365980327&amp;type=3&amp;   LOL nets "fans" smh
UNCHeels725.::Okay?  That's the best ya got?
knicks_112ndcoming::did u just unlike it?
denzioKNICKS4lyf::LOL
lakhani47::I dont see any team besides the heat that can beat the knicks
KingJames6Swag::Nets since anything can happen, Pacers and Bulls due to their defence
lakhani47::*other than the heat and knicks
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Nope. Knicks have taken losses this year that the Heat would never take.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Other than the Heat the East is wide open brah.
UNCHeels725.::Amazing there's more Knick fans here than Raptor fans.  Smh.
KingJames6Swag::Denzio if you're talking to me I don't like the heat but I respect Lebron
KingJames6Swag::Everyones like chawks comment...So must I
denzioKNICKS4lyf::you must CHEAT fan
denzioKNICKS4lyf::you got it son
Chawks116::Thats because we don't get bandwagoners or trolls
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Exactly. We have our core group and that's it.
knicks_112ndcoming::and also more than nets fans
UNCHeels725.::Exactly.
knicks_112ndcoming::right now  both.. but 2 months ago.. not alot
UNCHeels725.::Are you trying to prove that the Knicks have a lot of bandwagons or a lot of trolls?
knicks_112ndcoming::agree
UNCHeels725.::Same.  Point?
lakhani47::round one:   (5)Hawks will beat (4)Nets 4-2 (3)Pacers will beat (6)Bulls 4-2 (2)Knicks will beat (7)Celtics 4-1 (1)Heat will beat (8)Bucks 4-0  Round 2: (1)Heat will beat (5)Hawks 4-2 (2)Knicks beat (3)Pacers 4-2   Round 3;   (1)Heat will beat (2)Knicks 4-3  Finals: Heat vs Thunder or Spurs
ivandpc23::STOP IT (4)Nets will beat (5)Hawks 4-2  (3)Pacers will beat (6)Bulls 4-2  (2)Knicks will beat (7)Celtics 4-1  (1)Heat will beat (8)Bucks 4-0    Round 2:  (1)Heat will beat (4)Nets 4-1  (2)Knicks beat (3)Pacers 4-2    Round 3;     (1)Heat will beat (2)Knicks 4-2   Finals: Heat beat whoever  I'ma Pistons fan and D-wills my favorite player so not being bias at all but they won't lose to the Hawks.
lakhani47::lol. I just dont see how they can beat the hawks
denzioKNICKS4lyf::oh my! the NETS beaten 4-2, they're gonna throw you in the woods man LOL
denzioKNICKS4lyf::KEEP ON DREAMING CRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOKLYYYYYYYNNNNNNNNNNNN NEST
UNCHeels725.::Were undefeated against you under PJ
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Nets fans yapping about beating the Raptors BEFORE WE HAD RUDY, KYLE LOWRY DIDN'T EVEN START AND BARFNANI WAS OUR MAIN SCORING THREAT HAHAHAHAHA. EVERYONE BEAT US EARLY IN THE YEAR.   AS A NETS FAN I GUESS YOU GUYS HAVE TO FIND SILVER LININGS NOW THAT INSTEAD OF BEING THE BEST TEAM IN NEW JERSEY YOU WILL ALWAYS BE OWNED IN YOUR CITY BY THE KNICKS AND THEIR FANS.
hamel89::The Raptors essentially had one player one the roster (DeRozan) in the first half of the season. The injury list was ridiculous. Give the Raps a healthy season and they'd easily be a playoff team. Heck, they're still missing 3 key rotation players on their current win streak...
UNCHeels725.::"As a Nets fan" but you have Raptors in your name.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::"AS A NETS FAN I GUESS YOU GUYS" READING COMPREHENSION. NO COMMA AFTER AS A NETS FAN AND IT IS OBVIOUS I AM NOT A NETS FAN
UNCHeels725.::Amazing.  There's more Knick fans here than Raptor fans.
UNCHeels725.::Lol at Knick fans.  They lost to the Raptors TWICE!
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::How many times did the Nets beat the Heat, or the Spurs or the Lakers?
knicks_112ndcoming::right but isnt Deron playing like an MVP  according to nets fans.. why didnt they win?
UNCHeels725.::No one said that anyway.  We have BALANCE.
UNCHeels725.::He kept the game close.
Rezo201::30 and 7. Are you an idiot?
Rezo201::Wallace would have been guarding Derozan instead of a hobbled Joe. Don't comment unless you know.
knicks_112ndcoming::so?? u lost with full team..  sad
UNCHeels725.::So did u
Rezo201::No we didn't, no Wallace. He's our best defender.
denzioKNICKS4lyf::A$$ raped by the RAPTORS!
denzioKNICKS4lyf::past! You got raped by them now, LOL NETS LOL!
denzioKNICKS4lyf::y'all saying you're the best in the division how come a full cast is beaten by a non-playoff bound team? FAK nets LOL
UNCHeels725.::Ummm, no you lost to them THIS YEAR.  That's the present.  I guess 20 minutes ago is the past
Rezo201::6 point game is rape?
lakhani47::arent they the second seed in the east?
UNCHeels725.::Yes, but they're acting as if losing to the Raps is such a big deal, when they lost to them twice.
Rezo201::Yup, mentioned that also. They're idiots. lol
denzioKNICKS4lyf::owws so sour!
mikeyjm1412::What are your first round predictions for: Miami vs Milwaulkee New York vs Boston Indiana vs Chicago Nets vs Hawks  and which series do you think is the most intriguing?
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::Hawks will beat the nets in 6.
lakhani47::mines are the same as yours.  boston vs ny or ind vs chi is most intruguing  As a hawks fan, I was hoping we would get to play the nets so we can get into the second round this year. I would love to play the nets
Rezo201::The best one will be CHI vs IND, easily.
UNCHeels725.::NY vs. Bos is most intriguing.  Just make sure we get the Hawks round 1.
UNCHeels725.::Slugfest.
knicks_112ndcoming::indiana chicago good too
UNCHeels725.::Dwill needs to rest.
Mets2410::silver lining is that, while I'd like to see the Nets win every game, Deron and Joe can rest up before the playoffs
UNCHeels725.::Not Joe.  He needs more playing time.
KingJames6Swag::"Hahahahahahahahahahahahajaaahaaaaaa" said DABU
mikeyjm1412::You are a sick MF Dabu! Just Sick!
mikeyjm1412::I just add them to keep track of them. Not because I like them...
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::How are you a NY sports fan PLUS the Thunder? You instantly lose all credibility.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Hahahahahahahahahahahahajaaahaaaaaa. They will play 40 minutes a night from here on out.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::WHAT A WIN BY THE RAPTORS. BEATING UP ON FRAUDS IS OUR THING BABY!!!!!!!
ckonas::how are the nets frauds?
knicks_112ndcoming::@ATLHawks  With their win today, the #Knicks clinch the 2 seed in the East. That's really good for them, because they avoid us in the first round.  is this a good or bad thing?
UNCHeels725.::Are you guys playing starters vs. Atlanta?
Norway-vikings::good thing for them.
mikeyjm1412::Besides Miami, who else do you think can make it to the finals in the East?
mikeyjm1412::The knicks have melo and shumpert back so they can guard both of them. It is everyone else on the heat they have to worry about...
KingJames6Swag::You're right mikey but I don't see anyone guarding lebron on the knicks, and it'll be even more difficult if wade plays well like he did in the playoffs. If Kidd and felton though were to play at a decent level then it'll definitely be a tough game for the heat
mikeyjm1412::The knicks are a definite threat to any east team's playoff hopes... Even the heat...
KingJames6Swag::Now putting aside my dislike over the knicks, they definitely are in the same boat with pacers to head to the finals
KingJames6Swag::Knicks aren't anything to fear since any of the eastern conf playoff teams can beat the knicks except for the bulls
mikeyjm1412::They have the team to do it right... Nothing would stop them except the bulls and the pacers and the nets
Norway-vikings::knicks??
denzioKNICKS4lyf::yea the KNICKS!
mikeyjm1412::The knicks are a good possibility as well
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Pacers if every single thing went went.
KingJames6Swag::Pacers and celtics or bulls if they had their PGS fully healed
denzioKNICKS4lyf::haha you are terribly scared of the KNICKS man
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Miami Heat will go to the finals, Now in the west, Thunder,Spurs,Clippers,Grizzles,Nuggets(If Lawson and Faried comes back for playoffs) all have a chance at going to the Finals
KingJames6Swag::Honestly in the west any of those playoff teams can reach the finals, if only the East was that interesting
denzioKNICKS4lyf::be ready for the KNICKS  you CHEAT fans
denzioKNICKS4lyf::Nets want ice on their A$$
iNeeroX::im not even going to say anything considering the lakers and knicks are your fav. teams
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::You guys just did say something.
Mets2410::I'm not even going to say anything considering I don't even understand what he said.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::They got Gay Raped
knicks_112ndcoming::how many nets and pacers  fans trolled us saying we wudnt   achieve anything this season?? LOL.. it feels great!!
KingJames6Swag::Haha knicks man you're a loser for staying on this board trying to troll peeps, at least post better crap than the things you're saying
knicks_112ndcoming::its facts   sorry ur getting mad over this
KingJames6Swag::I love how knicks fans believe they can beat the heat just because of the regular season wins
denzioKNICKS4lyf::Miami CHEAT is so SCARED now
Mets2410::do you have any examples? or are you just saying that to try and make yourself look superior?
knicks_112ndcoming::im not a loser to save  troll posts sorry man
ssuri7::would you like a cookie?
KingJames6Swag::Took you guys long enough now try and get past the first round
mikeyjm1412::regular season does not count...
UNCHeels725.::Not to me.  He has common sense.  You don't.
knicks_112ndcoming::seems like u lost the argument  sorry
mikeyjm1412::We will talk when the knicks knock out the celtics
knicks_112ndcoming::yea it doesnt because seeding  dont matter in playoffs rite?
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::ssuri-- IF YOU ARE SUCH A HUGE NETS FAN THEN PUT THEM AS YOUR FAVORITE TEAM.   TO EMBARASSED I SEE. YOU WANT TO BE ANONYOMOUS WHEN YOU AREN'T ON NETS BOARDS.   YOU ARE A DISGRACE YOU LITTLE PUNK.
Mets2410::calm down
ssuri7::Reminder: the Nets were 22-44 last year and have home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. The Raptors were 23-43 and have home-court advantage on the couch in the first round of the playoffs.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA typical punk, just post the same thing over and over thinking you are clever. Never answering any charges against you.
denzioKNICKS4lyf::CRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOKLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYNNNNNNN LOL NETS LOL GOT RAPED BY THE RAPTORS :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D
mikeyjm1412::By gay you mean...
iNeeroX::im still wondering if we needed offense why marshon didn't play  i pretty sure he would have scored more than joe johnson
mikeyjm1412::PJ hate marshons guts... That is why he does not play...
John 3663::Thankyou raptors  -Indy
knicks_112ndcoming::We beat the pacers    twithout a true center     and also sacrificing our best player on defense. Shutting down West and hibbert  lets see Fat dwill doing that. MVP - status!
Mets2410::also I don't see how you can expect a 6'3 PG to shut down a 6'9 PF and a 7'2 C
Mets2410::I mean Nets beat the Pacers 3 out of 3 so what's your point?
159Yanks::We won all our meetings with the Pacers
159Yanks::Um so?
ssuri7::we won 2 away...you lost 2 away against Indiana
knicks_112ndcoming::we won without 4 bigs   beat that
njnetsdog13::Just a bad game by the Nets; it happens. As long as they regroup and can close out the last two games strong and Joe Johnson can make a basket every now and then, they have a good shot to beat Atlanta in the first round and then will hopefully make it competitive against Miami.
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Lowry,DeMar,Rudy,JVAL, If we add a Al Jefferson, Paul Millsap, Or Josh Smith this team will for sure win the Division. OH yea and Amnesy Bargnani.
mikeyjm1412::We will take barnargnie off your hands...
mikeyjm1412::yes
ssuri7::no
ssuri7::no one wants to live in Toronto....
Mets2410::most certainly better than montreal
ssuri7::AHAHAHAHAHAHA THAT'S WHY BOSH AND CARTER WANTED TO STAY, RIGHT?
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Toronto is a great city.
ignasm::Toronto is actually a great city
ssuri7::Reminder: the Nets were 22-44 last year and have home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. The Raptors were 23-43 and have home-court advantage on the couch in the first round of the playoffs.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::NOT EVEN JAY-Z WANTS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NETS ANYMORE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA. HE WAS THINKING TITLES, NETS WERE THINKING EMBARASSMENT.
Mets2410::I assume you missed the new song he released basically calling people like you idiots
ckonas::you misunderstood. he was talking to ppl that made fun of him for buying such a small stake in them, not net fans
ssuri7::Reminder: the Nets were 22-44 last year and have home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs. The Raptors were 23-43 and have home-court advantage on the couch in the first round of the playoffs.
iNeeroX::i am going to cry if the pacers lose their next 2 games, and i look back on this game like all we had to do was beat the raptors
iNeeroX::if we tie records they still get the 3 seed because they won their division
mikeyjm1412::We still can catch them if that the case...
mikeyjm1412::Bobcats 2199 NBA Champion! Book it!
mikeyjm1412::Me too... That would be a dream come true to see them win one
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::i hope i can live for that long to see them win.
ignasm::residing on Mars
knicks_112ndcoming::okay nets  won playoff games  in the last 13 years Whoop de do   and Still was not relevant LOL
KingJames6Swag::He'll just switch over to the Nets once the knicks get eliminated first round anyways
CarBoNz815::The Knicks were irrelevant the whole 2000's. They can't win a playoff game, before Melo and Amare what was the last year the knicks made the playoffs? lol
Mets2410::just leave. you're not funny and you're not annoying anybody. just wasting space on the board.
knicks_112ndcoming::u sound annoyed  TBH
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::HIGHLIGHT OF THE NETS SEASON  AARON GREY DOMINATING LOPEZ IN THE FIRST HALF AND JOE JOHNSON AIRBALLING 3s AT THE END OF THE GAME.
159Yanks::Yep thats the highlight of your season. Our highlight is making the playoffs and getting the 4th seed
ssuri7::HIGHLIGHT OF THE RAPTORS SEASON  BEING THE ONLY TEAM TO SIGN ARRON GREY
Mets2410::actually the highlight of our season so far was getting home-court advantage in the playoffs. highlight of your guys season could be being in the top-half of the lottery though.
iNeeroX::idk why you are so proud WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS
ssuri7::Raptors 2014 Lottery winner! Book it!
ignasm::that would be actually very good! Wiggins ...
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::ANDREW WIGGINS
mikeyjm1412::Raptors 2016 NBA champions! Book it!
odiesihs::As much as I love the Raptors, lets be real
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::I hope so
CarBoNz815::Never that.
iNeeroX::idk why raptors fans wanted to win this game maybe just to ruin our playoffs?
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::YOU PLAY TO WIN THE GAME
mikeyjm1412::Herm Edward's best quote
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Nets, Knicks, Raptors Atlantic Division is the best division in the league.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Agreed. It is going to be really competitive next year.
ssuri7::lol @ putting Raptors next to Nets and Knicks
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::I know Raptors are better than both.
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Celtics too
NjFan11::damn. I wanted to see the nets whoop the knicks in the playoffs
CarBoNz815::That would never happen, the knicks won't make it past round 1
