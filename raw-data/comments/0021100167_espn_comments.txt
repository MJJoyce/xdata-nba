jrtall3n7::"short handed Suns"  yeah, we were without our starting 20+ PPG center also. but it's the Suns who were short handed.
CosmoKramer1444::Steve Nash, at 38, is still more important than Lopez.
mr mellow::Deron Willaims need to think very carefully, if they do not get D-Howard the Nets will be the old Clippers for years to come.
zachrlee::Alvin Gentry should get Michael Redd move involved in the scheme of things.
damo_05::I love the Suns, to me there is no other team, but even I can admit they are in a world of hurt at the moment.  At the moment, its one step forward (win over the tired Blazers) and 2 steps back (lose to the Cavs and  2 - 9 Nets)   When are the changes coming?  I say sooner rather than later and most suns fans would probably agree with me.
spbynum1::omg New Jersey won! they are like TOTALLY gonna get Howard now! lol
KingGeorge53::congrats to the Nets.
Ghettovolcom::im glad we are losing it'll mean the rebuilding phase will begin very excited to possibly get a a top pick in the draft and hopefully we can sign some big free agents next season since we have so much cap space..
mdtuzo::deron finally showing why hes one of the best players in the league! what a beast!
DBACKSUNFORK::Lets just expect a lottery year!! Nothing else to hope for.
DBACKSUNFORK::You suck PHX Suns! I am so tired of the losses. New ownership NOW
JonahNYC::Marshon Brooks is the real deal.
CandySparker::Yes D Will, Yes D Will.
_Tim Tebow_::deron williams is still a beast
Jetlife122::Good win for the nets.. lets get another w tomorrow night
llGHOSTll::MarShon Brooks was a gift from the Celtics. I knew on draft night when they traded away JaJuan Johnson for him they were getting a great deal.
PresleyCutchTabata::in the months leading up to the draft i was hoping that teams would pass on Brooks because he was a senior entering the draft rather than an underclassmen, and during the draft i was hoping that teams would keep passing on him, i was extremely angry when the Celtics drafted him, but ecstatic a couple of picks later when he was traded to the Nets
Gami602::"Oh no,  We suck again!!"
mikeyjm1412::wade in the water wade in the water, children wade in the water God is gonna trouble the water...
mikeyjm1412::110 points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MetropolitanBronco::I believe this is only the second time we have gone over a 100 this season
PresleyCutchTabata::third, we scored 118 against the Nuggets and 101 against the Hawks last time we faced them
saralee509::wow phx sucks
cleb976::Nash, Hill, and the Back to back are a greater disadvantage than Brooke Lopez who they've been without.
whitepeoplelovewaynebrady::nice excuses.  the nets are without Brook Lopez!
cleb976::They're on a back to back without their two team captains who are starters...cut them some slack
fulla11::Love Nash, but yes, he is on a losing team, saddest thing in sports history
MetropolitanBronco::"MetropolitanBronco Nets will win this game 4 fans like this. 7 Hours Ago"   I told  you all the Nets would win!
mikeyjm1412::Cool Beans man...
Alex Kroll5482::See ya
mikeyjm1412::Good Night...
polomontana::Irving, Brooks and Rubio tops the ROY race so far.
mikeyjm1412::Irving and brooks are beasting
Alex Kroll5482::Oh well, suns will fight there way into the playoffs and get the 7th or 8th seed and I think they could pull and upset over okc or someone else in the west the suns are gonna end the season 38-28 on a good run.
cleb976::Finally, some one I agree with about the Suns
jjc11293::I highly doubt it, but good luck anyway.
jjc11293::225 points in two games. Let's hope it lasts. Good game Phoenix, good night all.
Rezo201::It's a nice feeling to dribble out the clock...
bamafan27-3::don't listen to kam_moto, he is a jazz fan
mikeyjm1412::Dear Carson,  Unswagful...  From Nets fan
carson2164::AND YOU WONT GET ANY
kam_moto::liar
kam_moto::you wont get many
PresleyCutchTabata::good game Suns fans
lemonsgee::FANCLOUD!!!!!   http://www.fancloud.com/nba/nbachat
Alex Kroll5482::I love the Patriots and all the people that don't like them or think they suck are clearly jelaous. Can't wait till people and analysts shut their mouth about stupid tebow thats the only topic in the nfl its stupid.
PresleyCutchTabata::Farmar
jjc11293::lol, Farmar. My man.
mikeyjm1412::#NetsSwag...
lemonsgee::Nash will not be an ALL STAR this year accorfing to 60% of sportswriters who stream through Fancloud http://www.fancloud.com/nba/nbachat
Constanza_George::Marshon Brooks looking really good out there. Definitely a contender for ROY.
PresleyCutchTabata::get the inbound to Morrow
chauncey1fan::cant wait till nets move to brooklyn
chauncey1fan::nice
pidge_25::Good win Nets!  Good luck tomorrow, it's gonna be great to see all the former Jazz players in SLC again!  Go Jazz!
pidge_25::I feel your pain, I'll be working tomorrow night barring an unseen miracle  Ha   I hope you guys get Howard by the way.  Nets would be up there with the Clippers and Heat in terms of teams that are fun to watch if they get Howard.  Best Center in the game with arguably the best PG?  Would be MUST-SEE TV
mikeyjm1412::They played well tonight. Too bad I was not able to see it on tv...
PresleyCutchTabata::GO NETS! and thanks
PresleyCutchTabata::Broncos 37, Patriots 3
cleb976::It'll be closer than the experts are predicting...but it will probably be the Pats that come out with the victory
Rezo201::My guess would be Broncos 27 Pats 24
jjc11293::Not sure if trolling.
kam_moto::BACKCOURT
mikeyjm1412::The heat are really feeling the heat from tim tebow...
mikeyjm1412::Patroits 47, Broncos 0
jjc11293::Patriots 37, Broncos 10.
Alex Kroll5482::Why do all of you people that hate both of these teams come on here to spam unless you like either of these teams don't come on here seriously.
JetsGrrrrl::is nash hurt?
Alex Kroll5482::Yeah Nash didn't play today because a cavs player kneed into him with his knee yesterday. Nash got a charley horse.
codytears717::TOOK NETS AND CLE ON A PARLAY LOOKING GOOD
polomontana::Nets would be pretty good with Lopez and Jones
PresleyCutchTabata::now make the free throws! give it to Morrow so that he can break the 20 point mark!
Alex Kroll5482::Disappointing to see the suns lose again come on man if the nets didn't have Deron Williams playing they would lose as well and Grant Hill is not playing
jjc11293::It was a reactionary post, obviously. This has been his best game of the season by far.
simtrick::What happened to Phoenix? They fraction stink
simtrick::Frackin
MetsNLChamps2012::Nets were just scorching tonight... Shouldnt even have come to this
supreme91::suns should just trade nash and hill to contenders...
JOE CARLS::yep we should just get whatever draft picks possible! Even if they are late first round its going ta be a deep draft might as well go for it
jjc11293::Deron Williams, kill yourself.
