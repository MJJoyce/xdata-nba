ThatsGoodSoup7963::Cool. Cool cool cool. Thanks for bouncing back and making my weekend better. Go CELTICS.
AndyMatches182::We lose by 1 point in OT just to come back and beat the same team by +10. WTF?
_I Am A Celtic_::The Celtics are too old to win back to back games
Shaun0088::You do know they are pretty young correct?
Mehta25::Apparently you don't understand sarcasm Shaun
apietman::Is the 0 boards for Garnett a misprint???
Excelscior1::No!  He had 0, though he claims he had one. LOL
Excelscior1::Evan Turner's a scrub. The guys has 4 career 20 pt games against the Celtics, but no more than ONE against any other NBA team. And for all the Phila fans that like to point out how well the guys is playing this year: Turner is only shooting 429%. So I was right; he's a scrub! Back to where he belongs last night.
_I Am A Celtic_::C's!!
nba is the worst::Celtics exactly 1 game ahead of last year's pace.  Hope Bradley can get back to full strength by the allstar break!
AceChapman::13 is a rout? Sad, overrated, OLD, C's team. It's fun watching KG and Pierce drag out those tired faces and old attitudes. They are SO not winning anything ever again. Rondo is a duush and Doc and Ainge needed to go 3 years ago when they held onto these jerks. Oh wait....Avery Bradley is coming back? He of the 10 NBA starts? Well that changes everything. SMH at pink hat C's fans
Jimmy30313::It was more lopsided than the score suggests
nba is the worst::Yes, it was a rout.
Excelscior1::@AceChapman  Phila was outta the game from the start. They were down by 20 at halftime (48-28), and never got back in the game, though the Celtics did put the scrubs in to make the score look decent for tools like you.
StoKedForever::C's were winning by about 20 and on route to 30 if they kept the starters in at the end of the game. So no not really.  2/10 for effort
Mr. Nut Job::Then they will lose tomorrow.  No consistency.  It's the 80%er of the NBA.
Spursdc::I see Garnett didn't bother to grab a single reb
TexasLonghorns247::I'm out everyone!

TexasLonghorns247::KG is tough. You just don't like KG. You'd say he's tough if he was on your team. PURE HATE
Jimmy30313::he's gotten into it with Noah on many occasions. He just don't take s**t from anyone, big or small
major red::nah, he only pick on small point guards and flails his arms up and plays guilty when he pulls a punk move on anybody with size.
