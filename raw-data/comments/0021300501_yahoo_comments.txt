Col Temp::Now all the Warriors need is some decent production from the Bench. We have a great front 5 and 6/7th are OK, the rest are not very good. Time for them to step. Night after night having the bench being outscored is not a sign of long term success.
Tony Anthony::Wow. First you have Bogut clearly moving trying to draw a charge on Wall, and the refs end up changing the call from a blocking foul to a double foul. Then on the other end Booker isn't moving and tries to draw a charge on Igoudala, and a blocking foul is called. The Wizards are getting in the paint just as often as the Warriors with contact, yet they're still getting less calls.  I'm not one to whine about refs, but from what I see the officiating is biased in favor of the Warriors, in the 1st half.
David::The infectious of Bazemore is great! But I just saw him give Bogut a huge bump that knocked him sideways. Bogut has a bad back. Such a bump could put him out of the game, or it could prevent him from playing as many minutes. Bazemore needs to keep that sort of thing in mind when he displays his enthusiasm.
C::Anyone from the "Trade David Lee club" man enough to admit how wrong they were?
Seattle Blows!::.............and the streak continues to 9 games.... 2 for 2 in bay team wins...one more to go for the sharks baby!
Cal::Warriors come out to plaaaay!
Seattle Blows!::thanks for congratulating the niners Jackson!
Hudgeliberal::Still think the best is yet to come from the Wizards.
YimingF::honestly I was too busy drinking while the Niners game. Nine games winning streak, and were still rolling!!! Warriors!!!!
Shaun::Wiz coach should have stayed with his bench they were  playing well before the subs  of wall and beal smh.
