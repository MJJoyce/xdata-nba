CrabtreeWasHeld::STEPH CURRY TIER 1 SUPERSTAR
Gimpay::what's the deal with lowry? what happened to him?
nurein::He sat down and broke his finger!  lol
BK HOTSHOT::The Raptors are better off without Andrea Bargnani. They seem to be losing more games since his return? They should have traded Bargnani. I thought they were a playoff bound team with the acquisition of Rudy Gay. But keeping Bargs was a mistake. The coach has got to stop making Bargs the go to guy and just play his hot hands at the time. Too many good players on the Raptors to be losing so many games. The coach is going to get fired if he doesn't wake up and just play his BALLERS....
jaxgang2::Lee goes for 29 &amp; 11 and still the opening talks about the overrated Curry. Curry folds like a cheap tent when the game is on the line and that is GS biggest problem.
jeff050578::Do u even watch Golden State games or do you just make random comments based on how you feel? I ask because if you watched Golden State games like I do, you would know that Curry has come up big many times near the end of games. He already has more career walk offs than LeBron James.
KyleLowryhasHIV::buy a wrist band for kyle
KyleLowryhasHIV::get well kyle lowry
KyleLowryhasHIV::rudy gay pays toronto fans to boo bargnani at home games
KyleLowryhasHIV::sad news about kyle lowry
KyleLowryhasHIV::why dont the usa just annex canada
KyleLowryhasHIV::what is the best city in canada to live in?
tommydilz::Montreal is the funnest, Vancouver the prettiest, Toronto the biggest.
the.city.::vancouver!!
KyleLowryhasHIV::from what I hear toronto is a nice place? do they speak french there
sous89::how'd amir johnson do so well?
KyleLowryhasHIV::david lee
CamOverRG3::Stephen Curry and his Warriors left the Raptors defenseless in Golden State
jaxgang2::And that is why you fail
SPEC1MAN::curry has skills
SPEC1MAN::Toronto can be a legit 6-8th place team in the east next year. I hope they dont make the playoffs this year so they have a higher chance at a good draft pick.
EhOhCanada::That pick would have to be a top 3 pick or else the thunder get it
SPEC1MAN::a center with legit skills on the defensive end.
KyleLowryhasHIV::what type of player would they be looking at to make them better?
SPEC1MAN::wouldnt matter who they pick, they would still be a legit playoff contender for a low seed next year. Personally i wouldnt pick anyone i would try to combo the pick with bargnagni and trade for someone decent.
1502blue::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNVBZuFaQvY
SPEC1MAN::says the guy with the hater tag.  like what you say really has any meaning.
KyleLowryhasHIV::if you had the number 2 draft pick who would you take that would make the team better?
KyleLowryhasHIV::wrong
CamOverRG3::The Warriors are great at home
KyleLowryhasHIV::marc jackson intimidates the refs
KyleLowryhasHIV::the warriors are show ponies
KyleLowryhasHIV::go lakers
Bama would destroy the Ravens::the words Dick and Gay are not censored by ESPN...hmmm...learn something new every day.
KyleLowryhasHIV::$@%! and $@%
KyleLowryhasHIV::i love $@%!$
KyleLowryhasHIV::sphincter
Bama would destroy the Ravens::Valanciunas better start developing for the raptors to have any chance...their bigs suck so bad like houston rockets bigs.
Bama would destroy the Ravens::i thought gay was supposed to turn this franchise around...is that what everyone said? espn? toronto?  lol. 5 straight losses.
SPEC1MAN::toronto is a much better team than they were at the beginning of the year. disagreeing with this makes you seem kinda foolish.
Jumeax::A Ball stopping 40%/30% Hero Baller, yeah that was totally gonna work, A Bargain at 18 million considering  not just any bum you pick of waiver wire could shoot 40% and 30%... Oh wait, pretty much any bum can shoot that
KyleLowryhasHIV::trade him
KyleLowryhasHIV::kyle lowry
LOL THE RAPTORS ARE STRAIGHT TRASH::I know right, my goodness... Their whole fanbase is SCUM and delusional beyond belief.
johnholmes6969::WILL RUDY GAY START NEXT GAME
KyleLowryhasHIV::good to see old dick jefferson get some court time i wonder if he will get more court time as the season progresses
Bama would destroy the Ravens::im not sure if dick will get more court time or not.
johnholmes6969::RUDY GAY IS SO SORRY
KyleLowryhasHIV::marc jackson is worried about kobe  he knows he is coming to get him
KyleLowryhasHIV::i think its time to finally trade rudy
tman8010::reading all the comments from long ago is pretty funny.
beebopbaloop::You mean those were Raptors fans guaranteed a playoff appearance?  Yeah.
KyleLowryhasHIV::start the playoffs now so the good players dont get injured
KyleLowryhasHIV::i hope it doesnt go full blown
zZSmOkIn-KuSh24Zz::Thanks Raptors Thanks for F.ucking up!  Sincerely Laker Fan
LakerDodgerTrojan::at least the Jazz lost though
LakerDodgerTrojan::Seriously....What a melt down in the 4th
KyleLowryhasHIV::steve nash needs to get some of the $@%! kobe's on
ice_in_my_veinz::THE WARRIORS CAN'T PLAY DEFENSE. JEEZ GOOD LUCK
KyleLowryhasHIV::buy a wrist band for kyle
KyleLowryhasHIV::get well kyle lowry
Smoove Rocket::new age outlaws with the win!
Smoove Rocket::ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh you didn't know?
Smoove Rocket::yow assssssssssssssssssssss better caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllll somebooooooooooooooooooody!!!
49ers9::still refusing to play defense eh
ImAWitness06::Warriors have played much better d like when they beat Miami but they haven't been playing great lately
KyleLowryhasHIV::you cant make players who cant play defense play defense despite how much you pay coaches
MafiaYang::better watch out for the raptors they might catch the bucks lol what a joke
Smoove Rocket::damn rosa is hot
KyleLowryhasHIV::klay thompson is overrated
ImAWitness06::Nah. He's a good catch and shoot
KyleLowryhasHIV::espn has the worst commentators  i just mute that $@%! and i can watch it
ploplox::IF YOU THINK NBA IS NOT RIGGED/CONTROLLED THEN YOU ARE THE BIGGEST FOOL IN THE USofA.
Krissycat1428@hotmail.com::Who in the hell is rigging a Raptors/Warriors game? Other than the Bobcats, I can't think of two more irrelevant teams in the league.
ImAWitness06::Easy excuse for losers to make
ImAWitness06::Nah. It's easy for losers to make that excuse. It's like who do you expect to win. If the Warriors beat the Bobcats some fans will be claiming its rigged and ill just smh.
ploplox::You are silly. I don't bet on NBA games. Just making notes on all the game. I am writing a book about the NBA scams.
MichaelKL017::Most Sports are rigged, not just the NBA.
ploplox::NBA is game by game. The jokes never stop.
easyrawlins1::Warriors got to play some dam D.
dodgers6341::GSW -6.5; GOT HEEM
ImAWitness06::Who do you think Stern will let have #1 pick this year?
AnAverageLakerFan::Orlando
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Laker fans bring the Spammers. Thanks guys.
Smoove Rocket::the raptors are going to try and out tank the magic and bobcats
KyleLowryhasHIV::they draft $@%! anyway
howdythrrr::ANYTHING BESIDES SPURS/HEAT WILL BE A DISAPPOINTMENT
ploplox::So you want it rigged for spur vs Heat huh? Now you complain later how NBA is rigged when you want something else.
ploplox::$@%!$@%! THE PACERS WILL KNOCK OUT MIAMI THIS YEAR
ImAWitness06::Nope.
AnAverageLakerFan::This is kinda bad.  No team in the west can beat OKC, barring any serious upset. And same with Miami in the east.  and OKC can't beat Miami.
dudemanbrohella::^thank you
dudemanbrohella::Have you even heard of the charlotte bobcats!?!?
howdythrrr::true those guys can ball
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Next 2 years are Miami rings for sure barring something major.
tomBabauts::Spurs? Are you giving up on the Lakers?
AnAverageLakerFan::Spurs didn't change, and OKC's starting unit only got better.  I can't see the Spurs overcoming that. James Harden wasn't a big factor in any playoff series, really  Lakers can't beat OKC. I'm confident they can beat anyone else though
howdythrrr::what?&gt; Okc is done w/o Harden
AnAverageLakerFan::Harden never made a big different in the playoffs.  Their bench is even worse, but their starting 5 is so much better than last season.. Kinda like Miami from 2010-11 to 2011-2012
ImAWitness06::That's the way I like it!!
KyleLowryhasHIV::did jalen rose have a stroke
johnholmes6969::yes he did hes at baptist east in memphis tn
ploplox::PLEASE BRING BACK FOOTBALL
ImAWitness06::5 straight 25+pt games for Curry. Nice!
tomBabauts::He's a baller but his ankles are brittle. Hope he stays healthy.
dudemanbrohella::Hes a superstar in the making
ImAWitness06::12 dimes too
