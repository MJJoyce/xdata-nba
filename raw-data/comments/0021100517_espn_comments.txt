CarpenterJ10::MJ has no idea what he's doing with the team
EvesPlum::Bobcats are PURE GARBAGE, plain and simple.  :(
Ruediculous::At least I'm not a Bobcats fan.
bobby30303::Lin keeps winning but can he match 150 MPG? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmlTrVha3M8
wingding2011::The Bobcats would do well by resigning Larry Johnson; Grandmama outfit and all.
papertiger12::4 - 29 has me missing the 90's and the days of the Charlotte Hornets.
todogg15::lin was going to be traded to the raptors day before nets game then knicks decided to give him one last chance. more details here: http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
KingGeorge53::I think it's official, Charlotte is gunning for more the most ping pong balls.
milw-jay::charlotte could be the worst team in NBA history,  Nice job, Mike.
DPetro10::In NBA history are you a $@%!$@?
wingding2011::Former players make terrible execs.  Universal truth in sport.
digitalbull75::I watched the 2nd half of this game and wow, if the attendance for this game is really 14,000 then the Palace must seat 80,000.
beastofcurry123::DAMN! MOOSE WITH 20 BOARDS!
rag63top::Does anyone else think that Kemba has a bigger upside than Augustin? Why is Walker only getting 18min off the bench?
CTthunder860::Kemba needs to start
tarumpaw::nope. i've watched him for the first time in rookie/soph game and even with no one guarding him, he was mediocre. Keep DJ he is pretty good.
Francona is a joke::because he's 15

Trubluemountaineer::YOU SUCK
todogg15::its crazy how little media attention this has gotten. In this years D-LEAGUE DUNK CONTEST 6 foot 2 Kevin Dobbs did a through the legs dunk over three ppl with a blindfold!! In my opinion its the best dunk ever. Check out the vid of it here http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
Talentsojhin::Didn't the Pistons complain last night about starters being in this late in the game while up a bunch?
DetKoolAid::both these teams suck its a lot different than your team being a playoff tam up 40 with starters in the game
Jimdetroitfan94::The most recent comment I can view is from 38 minutes ago.
SFEST13::why has kemba only played 8 minutes
Talentsojhin::It is an espn glitch he's played around 20.
nccanes73::a glitch on ESPN! unheard of.
saiem::The Bobcats and all the teams they've beaten should be eliminated from the NBA.
milw-jay::im embarassed to say my Bucks fell victim to this D league team.  I dont know how...
digitalbull75::See ya New York Knicks.
pistonpower313::who is the last pistons player to get a 20-20 game?
supreme91::Big Ben??
HouseOfSpears313::mcdyess
pistonpower313::who is the last pistons player to get a 20-20 game?
HouseOfSpears313::mcdyess
Ianlovesfozzypc::Rodman
DetroitSportsFan90::probably ben wallace lol
SpartyWinger::Maybe MJ's realtor could help him sell his share of the Bobcats while he is trying to sell that $30mil house
Thenew2211::Whats going on with Biyombo? hurt?
dirtydean5150::Terrible game from the Bobcats tonight. Hard to keep watching these types of games.
SpartyWinger::MJ needs to really sell his part of the team. He cannot have his legacy end with: Retiring from the Bulls, joins the Wizards front office, drafts Kwame Brown #1 (one of the worst picks), unretires and plays for the Wizards b/c they suck that much, then retire again b/c you realized that this idea may have hurt a legacy a bit more, then you join the Bobcats, then you become the majority share of the team, then you take them to rock bottom. And to make matters worse your son decommits from college b/c he realized the only reason he got a scholarship was b/c of his dad. Oh, he is also selling his $29million house and needs to find another. Outside of basketball and since 1999 MJ has not done much to savor his great legacy.
Statis_Ent::did bismack get injured?
Statis_Ent::did bismack get injured?
mmojica225::My the pistons have opened a can of whoop a$$

drewg1984::Pistons must have had the curse of the Black Sheep last night.
drewg1984::Somebody gotta pause this board. It's going too fast...
drewg1984::Damn. Almost scored as much at half as they did in entire game against Philadelphia.

DetKoolAid::pistons almost scored 60 in a half
dirtydean5150::I saw
Talentsojhin::The Bobcats certainly have taught the league how to loose a game just in the first half :)
drewg1984::Should make a movie: How to lose to a team in 24 minutes.
DetKoolAid::GMo bout to get a double double in the first half
DetKoolAid::GMo bout to get a double double in the first half
DetKoolAid::hell yeah pistons now keep it up! GMo bout to get a double double in the first half

marcpru60::MJ so competitive. Best NBA player ever. Wants throne occupied by I Thomas regarding most inept management person ever.
