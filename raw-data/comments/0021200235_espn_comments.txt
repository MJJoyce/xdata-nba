lott777::I think the Bulls could find at least 5-6 better starting point guards than Hinrich.
Rook_217::Name 'em...(that can actually be aquired and fit under the cap-not just "fantasy-drafting")
chicago d rose::we got the pacers next, hope we win
HawksCubs10::Nice win here, these are the games the Bulls need to take care of. W/o Rose.  Win the Home Games!  Go Bulls!
Linda33763::?What happen to your fake shooting guard Dark Shadow aka Jrue H, that pretenting to be a point guard. He never passes Nick Young the ball. Some fool wrote that Swaggy shoot to much.Taking 3 or 5or 6 shot a game its a joke, for a shooter. they take that minute in a minute. I see why Nick Young only sign for 1 year, instead 2. No 1 want to be in Philly.Good lost

BABY... IGGY...::Looks like the Bucks might win again, ohh well, we'll take the division lead before the all star break
paul3d::Milwaukee winning by 2
paul3d::If Boston wins we have the division lead we would be # 4 in the conference
BABY... IGGY...::Bucks losing by 3
Archie Mannings Stray Dog::Meh, they'll fade down the stretch, plus it's Boston, so I gotta root against the Celts.
