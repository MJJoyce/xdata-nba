RAY B::Is Martin OK? Wind burn can really hurt sometimes!!! Nice flop!
Dan::Embarrassing loss. The Raptors simply have the Wolves number for whatever reason. Rubio belongs in the D-League. The Wolves are well on their way to going a full decade without a playoff appearance. Pathetic!
Kim::How long is Flip Sanders going to let this go on ?
Godhelpusall::Right after Kevin Love called out his team (play some D Kevin) the team started falling apart (again)......   whats that say about Love???   He is all about points!
PKM::Raptors will win this.
Anton::Toronto has really improved. Where are the TWolves bandwagon fans? Minny playoffs? lol
Vítor Hara::LOL the wolves are pathetic, trade kevin love he is so over rated, ya he gets 20 points and 10 rebounds but really if his team didn't suck he wouldn't average half of that
anonymous::YES!!!! RAPS (I'm from TO) hosting rubio. always wanna c rubio play
tony::the T-wolves will never win with Rubio being a starting point guard, and it's time to trade love for someone that want's to play team ball ! ohhay and cory brewer  really??!!!
K101::wolves just straight up suck. trade everyone. Rebuild! jk but they still suck
