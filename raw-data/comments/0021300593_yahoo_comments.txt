Schmitty::Check out the sHeat heads crawling out of the cracks. Great, you beat the Sixers. That's NOTHING to be proud of after the embarrassing display your team put on this past week. Your high-point was Greg Oden playing for a few minutes when the sHeat were down by fricking 30. If you A Holes played in the West you'd be the fourth seed, you know that right. Your team isn't that good this year, they're all flash. The other elite teams actually take every game seriously, because they are true professionals and winners who play for real fans. Your free agents will want to play for those teams after this year and bolt, get a clue.
Heat-Dolphins-Marlins::I sure hope the refs cheat for us. We can't afford to lose another game because that would mean the HEAT won't make it to the finals.
Tom::Who is better this year Durant or James.
PKM::Lebron's final year on the  Heat.
mike::why does beasley get only 7 minutes while battier can lolly gag  for almost 20
Jerry::lebron just doing that thing he does every nite since he came.into the league. another player has a very good game and they want you to jump thru the roof.
Miami Champanseys::The CHAMPANSEYS had a hard time winning again LMAO
Dave H::Go Bobcats! lets give them a game, team rebound and take care of the ball. Lets go ! ( LeBron could come to help next year,  win one for Mike!- just sayin..)
Schmitty::You guys gonna let the Bobcats score 43 points in a quarter too? LMAO!!
