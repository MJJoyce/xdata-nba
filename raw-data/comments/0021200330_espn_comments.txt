darshn22::How JJ Redick is not a starter in this league baffles me... The NBA should start counting "Hockey assists."  I think Redick would be one of the top in the league...
HeatFollower::GS beats MIA, ORL, beats GS, therefore ORL must be better than MIA?
otownmagic4life::Basically.
OPENBBQ::I was watching NBA TV last night and they were doing their best to PROP UP this GS team and saying to myself "do these FOOLS see the score"? It's like they were ignorantly talking about the wrong team.
jayk0023::its funny, the magic are supposed to be rebuilding an have a similar record as the LAKERS lolol. good for you dwight
Telkalynn3013::How can you "hold off" a team and win by 14?
Allen Conder::-____- we cant even lose right  Sorry, i just wanted to suck for a year, get a good player (from an underrated draft class) then build it back up
gogata1993::Wow, surprised my team won this game. Hopefully they can be around .500 at season's end.   Atleast my boy Redick is doing work!
gsraider::Whatever Orlando....We'll see you in the Finals!
Allen Conder::You sending us tickets?! lol GS is a good team
comeatmebroe::mah n*gga redick
Oaktown1029::No Denver or Orlando on the schedule and we're 14-4. Those teams present size issues for the Warriors - down the road Bogut should help with the mismatches.
WarriorsWarrior::Agree
feeldabern::Lee is a stat accumulator not a winning bball player. Soft, doesn't rebound when it counts and plays no defense. He will never be on a good team.
Rjsyufy::He shoots an incredibly high percentage as well.
gatorfan15151::hes gonna lead the league in double doubles that is not soft at all
gatorfan15151::plus the dude has one of the best mid range jumpers Ive seen
gatorfan15151::yeah right dude lee is getting 11 and a half rebounds a night and a lot of times its an offensive rebound put back up for a dunk or he finds a man for a assist plus at his position he gets a steal a night, youre just a hater man David Lee is a pure basketball player and does what ever it takes to win the losses are on his team shooting bad David Lee is the man dude dont try making stuff up
screwhead2305::no one else showed up except curry and lee
longgrassgrows::this was just one of those games man...Magic could not miss...Warriors could not hit...oh well, onto the next one
SFWildcard::The Magic moved the ball pretty well just like the last time,. the Warriors defensive rotation sucks
SFWildcard::The Warriors D is pretty good against teams that like isolation plays like the Heat but are having a hard time with teams that move the ball a lot like the Magic and Denver
djzander90@gmail.com::I was talking about the Magic and the way they share the ball
SFWildcard::the Warriors seem to be a step behind with their D
djzander90@gmail.com::Kind of remind me of Denver when they lost Melo
raby627::You beat the Heat on their home court....then turn around and lose to the Magic on theirs.  Go figure!
baller1016::That's the NBA for ya
yabooboobearskate::Cant believe Mark Jackson is going to have his coach of the year in jeopardy because of Orlando...
djzander90@gmail.com::When is Turk expected back?
MagicBoltzRays::3 weeks?
otown13magic::Next time David Lee won't run his mouth about having more talent like he did after the Magic beat his a s s last week
feeldabern::Lee is a stat $@%!$. Not a winning basketball player. He is @%! soft $@% they come
gatorfan15151::if yall had lee youd be in the playoff hunt but the thing is your not, we had an off night because we beat the champs and all these other good teams so what one loss doesnt mean s.h.i.t. we'll be in the playoffs why yall get a high pick in the draft. magic fans enjoy not being in the post season
Virgomused::Yeah, good luck with mediocracy. Lol your not going anywhere with okc in town.
gatorfan15151::the thing is dlee does his thing every singal night even vs great teams its not his fault his team let him down, dont bash d lee who is twice as good as any no name scrub on the magic
otown13magic::as long as he gets his, everything is fine win or lose
otown13magic::he still lost...he had lots of games like that with the knicks and usually lost
yabooboobearskate::maybe it is karma
gatorfan15151::david lee still had 24 and 15 it wasnt his fault klay thompson shot 3 for 13
gator chomp swag::vucevic is becoming a great rebounder ....17 rebs tonight
djzander90@gmail.com::Glen Davis is the only downfall of this team...wish we still had Bass
Elton7323::yup he needs to improve his deffense than he would be amazing :)
TheCronoMasterMind::Good job on the win Magic :) let's hope we have the gas to go against those Bobcats tomorrow.
djzander90@gmail.com::I hope so..I'm really happy with the way the Magic are playing, considering all the boneheads at ESPN counted us out way before the season even started.
jumpy785::Loss #11 for Bobcats?
jumpy785::Once again Draymond Green another sucks......geez
ZxAxTxxxx::"Draymond Green another sucks"...... wow
bigk312::haha.. I wonder if he really thinks that makes sense?
Alex18PR::Tough shooting nigth we will get that W tomorrow in Atlanta
Ryanlax42327::Yeah right you're going to get run train tomorrow against ATL
Lemuel7043::we'll see :)
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::Styles (and matchups) make fights... Orlando is Juan Manuel Marquez to the Warriors Pacquio ;)
cxlo::please...orlando isn't as good as JMM. just an off night for the warriors.  look how many road games they played.
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::this isn't a perfect analogy man.  Orlando matches up well with Golden State.  So does Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma City &gt;&gt; Orlando BUT it doesn't mean that it negates the matchability of Orlando
SFWildcard::they sure won by a KO
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::Orlando is just a horrid matchup for the Warriors.. No shame in that.  Remember when Portland was actually good a couple of years ago, Golden State had their number.  Id always make money off that matchup when I went to Vegas
MagicBoltzRays::Three Stars: 1. Vucevic 2. Nicholson 3. Redick
SFWildcard::you mean tradeables
WarriorsWarrior::PUT IT THIS WAY I PREFER WIN AT MIAMI AND LOSING AT ORLANDO THAN LOSING AT MIAMI AND WINNING IN ORLANDO THAT WAS FUN!
trizzo23::how many times has golden state made playoffs last 20 years? 1 time..magic have 6 in a row..go to sleep
kewzee::but seriously, the Magic arent making the playoffs....weve already booked it
otown13magic::neither will the warriors....book it
ChuckGF::ahhahahaha this is funny
danielt818::magic won't even make the playoffs
otown13magic::cause u wont e in the finals...lol
WarriorsWarrior::We won't be facing orlando  in the finals anyway ha ha ha
jumpy785::oh well, we will get 6 wins tomorrow.
Lemuel7043::we'll see :)
armanioc9::Wooooohoo we won the final quarter!
dsupertech::really low expectations
WarriorsWarrior::5-1 I'll take it
dsupertech::According to the "dub" fanbase when they beat Miami, they are supposed to be "for real" and go 7-0 on this road trip. Don't blame me, blame the over zealous idiots that set the bar.
dsupertech::low expectations.
WarriorsWarrior::On the road no sir
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::Way to bounce back Magic and beat  a quality team...........................  Can u say Sweep!
Magic are better than you::Good game W's
ewillats::good game
Magic are better than you::This has been a weird season as far as how teams have been performing...  Bad teams doing well, good teams doing poor, etc..  Just don't see that very often in the NBA
Ryanlax42327::Golden state laid an egg tonight!!! What an embarassment
RockyMountainWay1::give me a break
Pau Gasol.::Remember when Warrior fans were mad that no one took them seriously?
csaeteurn::Remember when everyone is calling Pau Gasol soft? Oh wait he still is.
armanioc9::Yeah it's the lakers situation right now
hugefan1234::the warriors are a joke.  lucky win against the heat. they should put that win in the rafters
ChuckGF::15-8 is a joke? what does that make the 22 other teams below them?
Lemuel7043::Why are they called dubs?
ChuckGF::W
armanioc9::4 triples and 1 dunk and we are back in the game,  c'mon golden we still have time!
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::why is jefferson in the game
csaeteurn::We really don't have no one reliable at the 3 and barnes is inconsistent.
KevinPercic::Garbage time
csaeteurn::LOL at davis trying to dunk
Drun2400::Curry's legs are gone. Been playing the whole 2nd half.
Magic are better than you::Gotta say, the Howard trade is looking better and better for the Magic
Elton7323::true look at the lakers lol we have a brighter future imo
EnnBee15::Lakers up only 5 (with Wizards going to the line). 5 minutes to go.
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::keep telling urself that
MMiladin::Anybody watching can you tell me if it'll go over 189.5?
WarriorsWarrior::That's a serious gambling problem brother
KevinPercic::Not watching but no it won't sry
Magic are better than you::Not a chance
dsupertech::nope
Alx_Why::no
armanioc9::Final score golden 105- orlando 96
KevinPercic::Lay off the greens
csaeteurn::Richard Jefferson is worthless with a bad contract. Should have kept Steven Jackson
sfninergiant510::Jefferson still has a year left guys
armanioc9::Yeah ezeli was a steal
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::we got ezeli with that trade
WarriorsWarrior::Agree
Drun2400::He is gone after this year.
armanioc9::We have time golden, go go
19juami91::Kobe is the biggest ballhog ive ever seen
CsdRwb11::james harden*
MagicBoltzRays::we're badly out playing the W's tonight.
WarriorsWarrior::You guys are funny this is game six on the road theyre 5-0 and you guys are crying?
cballou18::I'm just glad they've showed life in the 2nd half. Only thing that pissed me off was that they looked uninterested out there in the 1st half.
cballou18::Warriors needed to quit leaving shooters at the 3pt line. They aren't even contesting these 3's its just wide open treys
kardian24::Warriors will still come back and cover
armanioc9::Wow etiopi moore for mvp
