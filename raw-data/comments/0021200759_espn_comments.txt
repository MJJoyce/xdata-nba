4 Petes Sake::Spurs fans shooting alot of knuckle butter over that slim lead.
parafal::anyone know the percentage of games R Westbrook is the leading shot taker ?
Qzhoopin20::Skip Bayless is the only other person that cares about FG attempts. Take Westbrook off that team and yes, Durant would average 37 ppg....but the Thunder wouldn't be 39-12 either! They'd be more like middle of the pack in the West.
4 Petes Sake::About 98%,  and OKC is 2nd best in the NBA.  So eat your heart out
Leroy Jenkum69::Thunder is a joke forever cursed dont deserve an NBA title losers.
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST107::All I have to say, is Thank You Clay Bennet. For ours smarting City of Seattle and the state of Washington.  If OKC had a course I doubt it would be looking like this team, no part of a course is good, and OKC is the best in the West, far from a course kid.
cowboyinorange87::feel better talkin crap online behind a keyboard loser???  there is nothing else you can say to defend yourself you just took the lowest road in showing how pathetic you are...  i love it.. reading these kinds of posts it always amazes me how dumb some people can be..  Good Day
Arbyrick::Whats really a joke is the Suns' announcer, Al McCoy, complaining that the Suns only shot single digit free throws for the game and wondering how that could happen. The guy remains totally delusional and cant accept the fact that the officials dont cause every single Suns defeat.....
ThunderHornz::Phoenix fans- enjoyed talking with you! I hope something happens for your team soon that will earn your fandom. Good health!
blakjak1298::had fun also
krazb79::Top Performers..  Phoenix: J. O'Neal 7 Pts, 8 Reb, 1 Ast, 2 Blk...   So Sad this D-League team is in the NBA.  It's horrible to see this...
arizonasting13::When your top performer is Jermaine O'neal you know your team is absolute sh.it. Ugh.
ThunderPokes405::Angus MacAskill was purported to have jogged down the lane with a 200 hundred pound barrel of pork under each arm!
AngusMacAskill::Jermaine O'Neal had a prime?
People Gettin Mad The Red Wings Aint Goin Away::non prime o'neil
tomcghee::maybe the suns could outscore a soccer team or a high school team
yawle7::Sarver and company have turned the SUNS in to a pathetic joke, not worth watching.
TreC1983::which is exactly why Steve Kerr jumped off the sinking ship
jamesrob26::michael beasley = joke .......... and hes not 6-10 what the bleep its been like 4 years already OMG espn
YankeeGod70::7pts 8rb. Top pro former !?  Lmao !!!!
John_Maddens_Brain_ tumor.::WOW the suns are a really bad team.
KDisNotNice35::Jan 11 - Jan 27 Durant  42 pts, 33 pts, 41 pts, 52 pts, 37 pts 32 pts, 33 pts, 35 pts. No headline, no MVP respect.  Lebron 30 pts, 31 pts, 32 pts, 30 pts, 32 pts.  Front page headline, with the MVP chants going.  The NBA has no justice system.
012garrett::i dont beleive lebron has a better 3 point % then kd if he does its only becuase kd takes more threes
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST107::No it's because KD doesn't play in the 4th because we are up so much at that point.  Also why he would miss the scoring title again if he does.
YankeeGod70::And shooting is supposed to be his weakness. Lol
YankeeGod70::I know but Lebron has a better %. This year. Even from 3. not all lay ups n dunks. Trust me !!!
YankeeGod70::Last shot KD !!
012garrett::dude durant is a better shooter then lebron
YankeeGod70::Fts durant all day !!! Everything else..... Factor in play making ,defense  it's not even close !!! Lebron is making history. AGAIN!!!!!
YankeeGod70::Rebounds ,assists!? Lebrons all day. Even three point avg......
MikeMike37::except that Durant is averaging a better overall shooting percentage than anyone in the league...field goals, 3-pointers, fts. he's on pace for a 50-40-90. Even Lebron can't say that and he's doing damn fine this year.
YankeeGod70::%?!!! It's not the points it's the efficientcy
-Td4mvp3 -::Spurs first to 40 wins!!!!!!! ohh yeaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST107::I see spurts fans are still thinking its all about the reg season. Lmao how did that work out any time this decade. They sure like to sound stupid these days.
GreatnessQSmooth::sefalosha led? Come On Now, He Might've Had A Good Game But He Didn't Lead Them http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJUXMkYFiXo
Gordoc0303::Haha at thabo being +38 for the game
Dadsterbug::Don't forget the Blazers are coming up soon...everyone is getting well against the Failblazers!   Tonight is was the powerful Orlando Magic.
Redwolf1331::Suns were just resting up for the big game Tuesday against the Lakers.  That's the only one they NEED to win.
remy 88::hey, I hope so
Solid Lennon 8::Lol at KMart not playing because of "the flu."  Isn't it funny how the only NBA players to get the flu are the veterans and they only get the flu right before they have to play a lottery team?
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST107::If you believe that, then I have some ocean front property for sale in Arizona you can by. It's just pop trying not to get fined again.
Galaxyyyy::CP3 had a bruised kneecap and Ginobili has a hamstring injury.
remy 88::what about Ginobli and CP3 who even knows what supposedly wrong with them? they never even bothered to make something up.
texican_10::yo

CandySparker::Turbo Sefolosha
Damato4950::They are better than my Bobcats
krazb79::I doubt that!!!  It would be like a football game score, or a high school basketball game...  Both are horrid, but I'd say the Sun's are worse!!
