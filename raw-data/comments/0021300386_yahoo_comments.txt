Clyde::The Bobcats have been a joke for years now but Kemba is really good.
David::The Bobcats aren't playing good enough defense seemingly because they are struggling on offense. Really DUMB. If you play good defense, you usually get a chance to get back in the game. It also leads to transition offense baskets sometimes. Steals help too. The Cats need to stop moping. Detroit isn't that good.
David::The Bobcats have 5 guys who are shooting decently tonight: Walker, Henderson, Zeller, Sessions, and Gordon. Ride the horses that have gotten you this close.
Commenter::Pistones have no idea how to close out games.  They are REALLY a BAD TEAM!!!
kevint::Right now, Pistons and Bobcats are the 4 and 5 seeds in the East. Are these teams actually threats or is the East just that bad?
David::The Bobcats are getting beaten badly on the boards. Then they are making turnovers on top of that. Bad strategy for winning.
PKM::Pistons can't shoot at all but sometimes their athleticism overwhelms the other team.
Kyle::my gosh pistons need someone on the bench that can coach some defense.  Second game in a row we give up a 40+ quarter.  This one cost us the game.
Kevin J::You have got to be kidding me with this 4th quarter!!!
MICHAELB::How BAD is this Piston team ? Looks like no playoffs AGAIN !
