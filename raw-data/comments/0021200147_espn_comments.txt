leftshot::Hyperlink on the home page says it all: Woefull, Winless Wizards.  When you are 0-9 and play mostly against Leastern Conference teams, you really are struggling.
MoeWoolridgeKingsbury::Can Wittman sit Ariza already?  -22 when he's on the floor, just terrible.  I swear, I could put a better lineup out there.
RabbiLevine::Pacers actually showing a little life in the last 3 games....
Don_Beaupre4Life::What would their record be with JW and Nene? I'd say 3-6.
JrueRandallHoliday::I guess the Paul George experiment is over now...  ... he still my fav player, though.
PHXAZwildcat::started following this online bet system called Sportsbettingstar a couple months ago. I have made about $3,000 a month average so far.  I was looking for a handicapper one night and just google searched the words  Sports Betting System, it was there on the first page. Didnt seem legit at first but ended up being awesome.
Sterling8673::I don't feel sorry for the Wizards. They knew NOTHING supported hiring a horrible coach like Randy Wittman. The guy has been a failure everywhere he has coached at.  I guess by hiring a guy with the record he has all of a sudden he was going to become Red Auerbach?
Hibachiarenas::I have yet to see anything Positive from Wittman. Same old story in Washington...
I3UTTON::Washington Generals &gt; Washington Wizards
JustIce_Adler::Generals did at least win 1 game.
SteelerCeltic::The Wizards can't win anything. They won't even win the lottery.
denn19641::Wiz just beat the Stones for the worst start this season. I hope they would beat any team come draft night.
bmrsnrox::wiz are a team on a mission. they were getting real tired of the bobcats replacing them in all the league punchlines.
simpsonpower::lol beal blows
JrueRandallHoliday::That's why I couldn't understand all the hype surrounding him coming out of college granted, boy can play, but top three pick... come on now.  ... same goes for the number four pick.
robpinpa::Fire everyone.. Rename them the Bullets and let's put together a damn team already, not mid level castoffs.
DemonRooster::the over was only 180 tonight, at least some out there is satisfied about this game
kthrilla31::29-80 FG.
kthrilla31::CP3 DAGGER!!
CamROY113::Its a long season Wizards fans.  You can take that as a good or bad thing.
fastfootedone::could the Wizards even win games at the NCAA Level??
CamROY113::It might be a while.
CandySparker::Cheers Washington with us!
kthrilla31::Sure the refs are bad but when you shoot around 33% you shouldn't expect to win either.
colejake2::Why is grunfield still here.....in any business if you posting deficits you need to make changes in leadership. Goodbye grunfield.
kthrilla31::CP3 CAN'T BE STOPPED!!!!!
IKnowYouReadThis::The irony in all of this is, the biggest winner so far this season is Michael Jordan. His Bocats are above 500 and playing great Basketball. The Wizards are the scrubs of the NbA and are deadset on breaking that record set by his Bocats. I'm taking MJ to Vegas with me next time! Jackpot
.Cutty::You think the Wizards with Wall will be this bad?
JrueRandallHoliday::When have the Wizards been relevant with John Wall running the team...  ... just sayin'.
IKnowYouReadThis::who's John Wall again? oh yes the dude otherwise known as "Mr Me too". They won't be as bad but not in time to win enough games to prevent the worst record in NBA  history.
bosoxrick::since 08-09 wizards are 88-233!!!!  THATS A .274 WIN PERCENTAGE!  and the gm recently signed a contract extension...all you need to know about this franchise
bosoxrick::those were fun but grunfeld thought that was a championship team so he mortgaged the future to build around the "big 3" of arenas, jamison, and butler.  shortly after butler got hurt and #0 brought some of his toys to the locker room
knicks_11::i jst went to a flashback of those classic wizards vs cavs games. looks were those two teams are now
WatergateSean::Without Wall and big Brazillian wizards are hopeeeelesss.
WizSkin95::Not really. We just can't play a complete game. All of our Ls have ben by less than ten except the bobcats
bosoxrick::dude they're still 0-9. they got a lot of heart which is great but it can't overcome their severe lack of talent
7horns7eyes::About time you showed up, Roy.
Ouch My Shoulder...I Cant Walk -Dwyane Wade::Wizards starters were 8-36 from the field.....what the hell
knicks_11::best defense in the league!!
sportsfan1014::my Wiz are hopeless..
Sports_Fanatic_3::idk if Phil would want to coach the wiz, but it would not have hurt 2 ask him.
I3UTTON::"LOL"  - Phil Jackson
dubcheedubmee::theres no way in h.ell
Sports_Fanatic_3::The GM should be fired for hiring the interim coach as the head coach w/o looking for other candidates.
Ouch My Shoulder...I Cant Walk -Dwyane Wade::he's an idiot. phil jackson is somewhere on a couch right now watching nba games
Capt.Voody::=(
Rexanilatorz::Only had 5 turnovers in the 2nd half compared to 15 in the 1st half!!!
DX_Hoo::Literally cannot win without Wall and Nene. How snakebitten is this franchise that we lose our two best players for a month?
Denis2224::Shabazz and John Wall in the same backcourt? Sick!
Rexanilatorz::David West and Roy HIbbert combined for 50 points/20 rebounds/6 assists/8 blocks and shot a combined 75% from the field!
Taco with a Q::West is getting amped up tonight to face his former team!!!  GO PACERS
Taco with a Q::On Wed I mean
BiggestHandsomeHoosier_Colts_STLCards_Pacers::Solid win.
GeorgeTownMan29::Okay Wiz was a bad team to begin with but our 2 best players are out so what did people expect?
rickyoil::ty pacers i put the reverse jinx in
Taco with a Q::West sounds like a smart man too when he talks...
Knight13951::Good game by the Pacers. I hope the Wiz don't go 0-10.
d butler16::It sure is fun being the laughing stock of the NBA
bengalsrgay43034::good game.  you all will be better when wall and nene come back
airic.ad::david west is a MONSTER
Taco with a Q::West is BAD!!   A BAD MAN!!!!  What a beast
Ouch My Shoulder...I Cant Walk -Dwyane Wade::I hope the Wizards break the record for longest losing streak (26)
hoops 112hoping::C/ATT	YDS     AVG	TD	INT	RAT. C. Kaepernick	9/11	158	    14.4	1	0	149.1  START HIM OVER ALEX SMITH EVEN WHEN HE'S HEALTHY
EastCoastSurfing::I've been trying to tell niner fans that all season.
My Best Friends Are Alcoholics And So Am I::The only thing worst than having a ticket to a Wizards game, is having season tickets to them.
Rexanilatorz::DAVID WEST WITH 30 POINTS SUCH A BEAST!!!
