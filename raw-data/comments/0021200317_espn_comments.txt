JJWags::w8 so why does lin need to score why cant Harden whatever is working they didnt even have an offseason together but harden and lin are starting to be good friends and I have noticed lately harden passing to lin alot more the coaches need to tell who has the ball like harden did in okc last year who will take it up harden or westbrook?
JJWags::so just switch off run high pick and roll with lin if it dont work kick out or back to harden have harden take it up run the high pick and roll etc
luckywin7::lin 24 year old  is 6'3 tall 200 pound and harden 23 year is 6'5 tall 220 pound........lin take control the damn ball and it OKAY to shoot the ball no matter what
dreamks::Lin nuts are hilarious.  The dubious cherry picking, the irrational blaming and now some of you nuts want him traded to the dsyfunctional Lakers.  You think he's not getting the ball now and you want him to play alongside Kobe?  Hahahahaha....
FLC-8R::I thought Lin haters think he is bench material? So now you think he is a better starter than Nash?  Make up your mind.
NguyenDragon::He will run second unit in LA... Nash is still there if I am not mistaken...
luckywin7::he bench.....well that his home state...........
luckywin7::lol sorry no kobe but your laker fans that wanted it..........lol
831Gangsta::Harden=OVERRATED
sports guy12::Funny a Laker fan talking smack
luckywin7::i wish new coach would create new team like landry, novak and others player who appreciated lin,
razzledazzletj81::Actually hes does, Lin made those guys better and vice versa. Team ball wins over stars.
RNYC::Dude shut up. U don't know anything about bball
rm90025::McHale needs to watch early film of Parker/Ginobili playing together.  That's the closest analogy to Lin/Harden.  Watching some tape of Lebron//DWade would help too.  Those guys share the ball a lot in the same possession.  I rarely see Harden pass to Lin.
JustPlayBall1234::McHale is a terrible coach. Instead of keep saying he wished he had the last possession back on the Spurs game, he should've said he was dang proud if his young team, with more hard work, the sky's the limit. He's not a positive coach and does not do his players any favor. Yes, looking at tapes would help but I wonder if he's too dumb to realize that.
NguyenDragon::Most of the time ball movement dies with Harden...
luckywin7::mchale should see clearly on film and analogy lin/harden on the play, what a dumbazz coach. i think mchale have no faith in lin.........
luckywin7::Coach McHale need the fck wake up and work with LIN once again!!!!!!!!!! LIN need to take control the damn ball and not pass to harden. When Harden on the field court, lin scored low. When there no harden on the field, LIN scored HIGH......harden and lin need to work together share the ball
JustPlayBall1234::McHale does not respect JLin and will never use him to his potential. The Rockets should just admit they'd miscalculated and trade him already...but who will take him?
Tuoi56::Wizards need him badly
NguyenDragon::I am sure D'Antoni would love to have JLin back... I doubt Les Alexander would OK a Jlin trade though... I say bring in Jerry Sloan...
luckywin7::no way d'antoni wouldn't want Jlin back? d'antoni in knicks he dont know what to do with stars player  when lin completed gone wild msg. Yes he gotta himself confused so he resigned.....quiter?
roll_n_riot::So  umm yea, this Harden / Lin backcourt not really getting the results you'd want for $90mill  Kind of offense getting run is definitely a factor.  Jerry Sloan knows how to coach a pick and roll offense.
NguyenDragon::McHale is way over his head... We know they can both play... They just cant play together... McHale better figure something out soon...
sports guy12::nice win Rockets
buimonster::"TYPING IN ALL CAPS TURNS YOUR OPINIONS INTO FACTS ON THE INTERNET!"  -rEdBuLxTaSy
rEdBuLxTaSy:::);):)
Lorenzomax7::So many trolls here wasting their time to troll themselves...
sjabruning::Marcus should be starting. He is the most productive 4 we have.
vonsteve6868::Patterson's actually surprised me. He's showing some real talent in spurts. Before the year, I thought he'd be 3rd on the depth chart by now.
bobbydagreat::I have a feeling the 2 most productive PF's on the Rockets didn't play in this game at all.
NguyenDragon::DMo and TJones?
Tyrone Biggums is better than DWheelchair::Damn Harden, 2 assists and 5 TOs. They seriously need to work out the backcourt situation.
AlphaBeta123::Hands down, the biggest let-down on the Rockets this year is Royce White - not a certain Asian-American PG
bocabenny33433::He's above average if they will give him the ball and let him be a PG.  I like Lin and rather see him on the Lakers.   Trade Lin, Parsons, Jones for Gasol, Blake and Duhon.
bobbydagreat::I never expected anything from Lin, so I'm not disappointed that he's an average PG. Royce White is nothing but a waste of a pick, a complete bust that will never see the NBA
Titan-GM::What does "Like" and "Lin" have in common?
fred3857::His parents both come fron Taiwan,not China. Taiwan is Taiwan,China is China. They are different countries.
esgdf::so stupid you are
eenz3::I hear you brother, it's cool.
west57street::my point is that just because you are ethnically chinese doesnt mean your nationality is chinese. singaporeans are also majority ethnically chinese yet they are not called "chinese" they are called singaporean. just like taiwanese are ethnically chinese but they are taiwanese.  just remember that and you'll be a-ok. and dont listen to your chinese friends, listen to your taiwanese friends. they have the right to call themselves whatever they want.
eenz3::Yup I know that Taiwanese is their official Nationality.. we are getting off course here I was merely using "Chinese/Taiwanes" because of their similarity in language. But no, you will never ever here an American refer to Germans or English as American.
west57street::of course they'd say that cuz they're chinese. but everyone knows taiwanese is a nationality. americans can be many ethnicites like german, english, etc. but they are still american just like taiwanese can be ethnically chinese but they are still taiwanese.
eenz3::And also, my Chinese friends refer to people from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore as Chinese while people from China are Mainland Chinese.
eenz3::Dude chill i'm not saying china and taiwan are the same, I just wrote "China/Taiwan" cause both of them use Mandarin. And I was pointing out the "L" in Mandarin.
NO Pelicans::"Rike"*
eenz3::Just so Americans know, Chinese/Taiwanese people use the sound of the letter L in their language. You sir are racist. You are making it sound like Chinese and Japanese are the same
bobbydagreat::Once again, the only two Rockets I care to see on the court got exactly zero playing time.
AlphaBeta123::delfino should be the one not coming off the bench.  Replace him with Jones!
rEdBuLxTaSy::DMO AND WHITE??? :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::WELL IF THEY TRY TO HELP WHITE AND HE DOESN'T TAKE IT, THEN MIGHT AS WELL FIND A NEW OCCUPATION THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE STRESS OF FLYING :):):)
AlphaBeta123::he has issues.  Everyone has issues.  Suck it up.  Rockets did far more than he deserved by drafting him, making special travel arrangements just for him and all they asked in return was that he see a doctor of their choosing.  Hardly unreasonable.  He then goes on Twitter and rants making him look like a spoiled child.  Good riddance.  I haven't heard anything about him and I don't care to.
bobbydagreat::He uses his issues as a crutch, he acts like there has never been anyone in the NBA with anxiety issues before, I don't have any time for someone like that.
rEdBuLxTaSy::THAT'S KINA HARSH...GO EASY MAN, THE KID HAS ISSUES :):):)
bobbydagreat::White can die in a fire for all I care, he'll never play in the NBA
bbears88::Terrence Jones, Daequan Cook?
bobbydagreat::Terrence Jones and D-Mo
Master Machida::Manny Machado?
Titan-GM::Lin's career stats:  Games Played: - 84 Min. per game: - 22.4 Field goal %: - .424 Free throw %: - .804 Rebounds: - 2.7 Assist: - 4.5 Steals: - 1.5 Turnovers: - 2.3 Points: - 9.7  An average (anonymous) player  Games Played: - 514 Min. per game: - 25.6	 Field goal %: - .428 Free throw %: - .677 Rebounds: - 4.4 Assist: - 2.0 Steals: - 1.4 Turnovers: - 1.4 Points: - 9.0  The anonymous player has an 8 year experience in the NBA. I wonder if he even was close to Lin's stats in his rookie year, but well lets see the big picture shall we? We got a promising young talent right there and you can't deny that.
rEdBuLxTaSy::STOP IT MAN...THIS IS RACIST!!!  MATH/READING IS NOT THEIR STRONG SUIT --&gt; OBSESSED LIN HATERS :):):)
bbears88::Chris Tang, recruited by Oak Hill Academy (Rajon Rondo, Brandon Jennings) is a SG with Yao-Ming type lineage (both parents were basketball players in China).  Hopefully he grows into a good player in college, and perhaps makes it to the NBA.  If so, you will see the Knicks will draft him to please their fans who are here today on the Rockets board bashing Lin for leaving their beloved franchise.
fred3857::Lin is nothing to do with said Chris Tang but asian americans.Lin's parents are from Taiwan not China.
JustPlayBall1234::JLin has nothing to do with Chris Tang whoever he may be. He's trying to make it on his own an NBA basketball player, without race, religion and school reminders and comparisons. And bloggers and players wannabes do not need to use his name to grab attention. Give the kid a break.
George7844::bbears88 - "Chris Tang, recruited by Oak Hill Academy (Rajon Rondo, Brandon Jennings) is a SG with Yao-Ming type lineage (both parents were basketball players in China)."  You failed to mention that Chris Tang has a beautiful sister named "Poon" and a brother named Must  !!!
Dawan208::I seen him.  He's can ball!
AlphaBeta123::I think Lin definitely opened some doors for future asian americans.  That's the biggest impact he's made to the NBA thus far.  Good luck to this kid.
JustPlayBall1234::You're kidding me!
bbears88::go to youtube--they're calling him the next Jeremy Lin
gerald_5::im out lin fans, it was fun messing with yall, have fun with your avg guard...  you are welcome to visit the knicks board tomorrow after we beat the lakers... its a win win for yall, cause i know you guys hate the knicks and i also know you hate the lakers (cause we all hate the lakers)
woopzzzz::i'm out too. just checkin on the game stats. this was a complete waste of time as usual!
rEdBuLxTaSy::OK BYE BYE...I'LL BE SURE TO GREET YOU THERE AND CONGRATULATE MElo/FATON:):):)
woopzzzz::close enough. i give 14 yo passes. but it would be very sad if any  of you are older than 25.
rEdBuLxTaSy::HEY KID, NO SWEAT :):):)
gerald_5::nah 14
woopzzzz::giggle? figures, you must be 6 y.o.!!
gerald_5::haha "faton" made me giggle
largehrdsports20::The Lin-Apologists are consoling one another, wiping away each others tears. Isn't that special! Hahaha!
AlphaBeta123::yup, not like coming to the Rockets board just to bash on Lin is pathetic or anything. :)
rEdBuLxTaSy::"ALL BY MYSELLLLFFFFFF" ~~ DELUSIONAL KNICKS FAN :):):)
gerald_5::its a beautiful sight
woopzzzz::i find it very odd that these regular lin haters find the time and energy to always come here and hate on lin. clearly they are not lin haters. they are closet lin lovers. dont make sense they would devote so much time n energy to hate on him. if i hated someone, i ignore them!!!!! they are secret lin fans for sure.
Master Machida::I admire Lin because he made me alot of money on ebay last year but the dude sucks donkey balls.
woopzzzz::k. ya i noticed you're not a regular lin hater like some other regulars here
Master Machida::No Im here for The Beard.
woopzzzz::fair enuff but  doyou hate him enough to always troll here and trash him?
rEdBuLxTaSy::HEHE AT LEAST YOU WERE SUCKING OFF LIN :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::HAHAHA OR THEIR LIVES MUST BE VERY BORING / MISERABLE.  BUT HEY AT LEAST WE GET TO ENTERTAIN THEM :):):)
Yu_Darvish_and_Ichiro::LOL VERY TRUE
woopzzzz::lin is no kobe or wade or lbj. dont make sense he would warrant so much hate like others have for those superstars. kid played less than one season, is learning and developing and just wants to ball.
gerald_5::everytime you say something about lin fans come out and scream: 38 pts vs TP  but they dont mention the L and the 27 pts and a trip dub by parker
rEdBuLxTaSy::AGAINST A GOOD TEAM LIKE THE SPURS???  AND WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?  UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY A CLOSET LIN FAN :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::SAYS THE BUTT-HURT KNICKS FAN YOU ARE...AND AS IF YOU CARE HAHAHA :):):)
largehrdsports20::Someone is mad butt-hurt, anally devastated.
Yu_Darvish_and_Ichiro::Sitting Lin for 3 mins near the end of 4th quarter.  Spurs went a 7-0 run. McHale did it once again. You clearly did not watch the god dam ball game.
woopzzzz::he's clutch in other ways too like facilitating, playmaking, defense, etc. and good ole fashion competitive attitude, leadership and sportsmanship that rubs off on his teammates
gerald_5::hahaha since when... only clutch shot was against toronto last year...
woopzzzz::very true. that game coudlve been won by rockets if they kept lin in the 4th. he's a consistent clutch player
woopzzzz::why would they talk about parker? they're lin fans, not parker fans. would parker fans rave about lin's 38 pts? illogical!
AlphaBeta123::Douglas was guarding Parker you moron.  You didn't even watch the game.  As usual the idiots don't know anything.
rEdBuLxTaSy::I LOVE WHEN THEY'RE CAUGHT WITH THEIR MOUTH OPEN :):):)
woopzzzz::i can say parker let lin score 38 points on him!!
gerald_5::TP is a 3 times champ and a finals MVP, you cant say $@%!$ about parker
woopzzzz::then you can say parker sucks on defense cuz he let lin score 38 on him!! right??
gerald_5::lin was guarding parker so...
cityhunter4::Houston should make a decision now: trade Harden or trade Lin.  They can't play together.
esgdf::mchire= lin heater
George7844::cityhunter4 - Houston should make a decision now: trade Harden or trade Lin.  They can't play together.  <b>It's better to sit there and let ppl THINK you're stupid.......than to make a statement like that and REMOVE ALL DOUBT !!!!</b>
largehrdsports20::They can't trade Lin. No one will take his contract the way he's playing now.
Titan-GM::I'd gladly trade Carmelo for Harden/Lin
godsent224::you're a moron. no one would trade melo for harden now, thats just dumb. maybe in 7 years when melo is old. lin doesnt even factor in
gerald_5::so you think harden/lin&gt;&gt;melo??
gerald_5::thats crazy
Harrison_Texans::Rockets win
woopzzzz::even tony parker believes in lin and says he's where lin's at now when he was his age. i believe the words of an elite pg, not lin haters n critics, thank you!  http://blog.chron.com/ultimaterockets/2012/12/tony-parker-sees-similarites-with-lin-at-same-stage-of-career/
esgdf::no harden everyone play better
cityhunter4::Lin can't and will never excel playing next to ballhog Harden.  One of them needs to go.
woopzzzz::no harden is the best player and valuable to the team. coaches need to get them to play together like lbj with wade and others
largehrdsports20::Yi&gt;Lin
cityhunter4::Chinese Communist Propaganda machine at work here.  The nation of China had great hopes on Yi the  loser
rEdBuLxTaSy::OK I GUESS YOU CAN'T BE RACIST :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::GEE, AND YOU HAVE FEELINGS?  PERHAPS YOU NEED TO STOP YOUR RACIST RANTS AND I WILL STOP MINE.  "MONKEY DO, MONKEY SEE":):):)
largehrdsports20::You're the one always talking about cotton-picking and welfare.
Titan-GM::Lin&gt;Liu&gt;Law&gt;Lei&gt;Lee.......&gt; every L you want
Stanley5826::That's kind of funny, all Ls. Hahaha
cityhunter4::"Great job Lin, now go back to being my ballboy"  - Harden
Titan-GM::"Just keep rollin nig.ga"  - Lin
Titan-GM::There are two types of fans who troll the most on ESPN. 1- Lin haters 2- Lakersfresh supporters Lots of drama. I love it.
deadbeet76::kobe haters vs lebron haters tops the list
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND I THOUGHT LIN FANS WERE BAD HAHAHA :):):)
gerald_5::those are the best
gerald_5::heat fans are the worst of  all
roll_n_riot::Lakers fuktards by far, they fill up half the posts on EVERY TEAM's message boards
gerald_5::again, im not a lin hater... im just real, lin is playing like an avg PG right now
Stanley5826::38 vs TP without harden is average or flash in the pan?
bbears88::You will be hating Chris Tang when he's in the NBA in a few years
Titan-GM::99% of people in here would actually call you a Lin hater in disguise
woopzzzz::ok so he may play average this season. dont mean he cant improve and get better with experience. why is he any different from other young players who's rough and would get better over time?
gerald_5::i said RIGHT NOW... i never said anything about his career
Dawan208::Thankyou
rEdBuLxTaSy::THAT'S YOUR OPINION SO WHAT?  WE'RE JUST SAYING LIN HAS A CAREER TO WORK ON.:):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::40+ GAMES ONLY SO YEA KEEP ON COUNTING :):):)
gerald_5::not my opinion... 10 and 6 is avg man
gerald_5::redbull whats with the faces??
rEdBuLxTaSy::CAN'T YOU TELL??? :);):)
largehrdsports20::Everything I've said tonight was against Lin-Apologists, not Lin. I would never truly wish another person ill, unlike you Lin-Apologists--you're petty and base.
woopzzzz::not all lin fans are apologists and not all are extremists. some are very reasonable. but you can say the same for many lin haters - many are very extremist and unreasonable and overly critical. apply your standards and criticism to both sides please
largehrdsports20::I'm speaking for myself. So what the fuccc are you saying?
rEdBuLxTaSy::IF YOU DIDN'T CARE FOR LIN, THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?  DELUSIONAL?  OUT OF GAS?  BEEP BEEP ;):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  US EDUCATION COST ARE UP THE ROOF IT'S RIDICULOUS!!!
largehrdsports20::Were you educated in the US, rEdBuL?
rEdBuLxTaSy::FOR SOMEONE WHO RUNS THEIR MOUTH A WHOLE LOT, YOU DON'T LISTEN TO YOURSELF VERY WELL :):):)
largehrdsports20::For someone who types a lot you don't read very well.
Yu_Darvish_and_Ichiro::LOL
gerald_5::same here... they're too damn sensative
Titan-GM::Harden is on the way to be the Kobe Bryant V2. He has all Kobe's qualities. Lots of points, ballhog, 5 turnovers per game and likes to have the team roll around him. I just hope he doesn't get way too much from Kobe. He's already got enough.
cwjones36::Kobe has 5 rings playing that way!!!!!!
gerald_5::harden is a better playmaker, not even close
Hank10593::I think all Lin supporters should give a big applause to the Lin haters because they show up here at Rockets board EVERY NIGHT to show that they care about Lin. They certainly make things interesting. Thanks for showing up tonight, largehrdsports20 and gerald_5. It's good to know that even people like you who are struggling with your lives still come here and show how much you care about Lin. Thanks again.
Stanley5826::Let us all Lin fans forgive them for their wrongdoing like Lin would do.
Yu_Darvish_and_Ichiro::Lin haters work extremely hard.
gerald_5::i HATE using the race card, but do you guy really think lin is the only player that came from a small school and had the month he had?? only reason he had all that publicity is because he looks asian (born in us)
rEdBuLxTaSy::OH MY, SOMEONE IS DOING SOME CRITICAL THINKING.  THIS CAN'T BE REAL??? :):):)
woopzzzz::i just looked at the box score.dont know what you lin haters are talking about - he had a solid game. 10 pts, 4/8, 6 assists, 5 reb, 2 tos. he shot one less than toney douglas. harden played well but had high turnovers as usual. his average is 5-6- per game. yet nobody generalizes and ranks on harden for his tos like they do with lin. even last season in games when lin was scoring 20+ points and knicks won, people ranked on his tos.
bbears88::you forget--he has to be compared only with PGs with 7+ years in the league or make at least $10M per year
woopzzzz::exactly. lin's always compared to elite pgs or veterans. his critics will never change!
rEdBuLxTaSy::"OH NO YOU DON'T GO HATING ON THE BROTHAS"  ~~ OBSESSED LIN HATERS :):):)
largehrdsports20::Respect for Yao; wish Yi would get it together and be the star he could be; hope Lin is still around in two seasons, won't miss his Apologists, though.
cityhunter4::Yi suks, fact, he is not in the same league as Lin and Yao.
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND WHO ARE YOU AGAIN??? :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::THIS BOARD'S BUTTFACE YOU SAY???  :):):)
largehrdsports20::This board's bully; that's who!
woopzzzz::a secret lin lover
nimzoray::Rotation should be Lin/Harden, then Lin/Douglas, then Harden/Douglas with Harden being the PG. Toney Douglas is a SG trapped in a PGs body.
gerald_5::TD sucks as$
nimzoray::He just sucks at being PG, let him catch &amp; shoot and he is decent.
gerald_5::lin fans will watch basketball for another 5 years... till he retires
m_gunners::are you out of a job? u have lots of time to write $@%!!
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND DELUSIONAL BITTER KNICKS FANS WILL WATCH BASKETBALL FOR ANOTHER 5 YEARS...TIL MELO PASS 1ST ROUND :):):)
gerald_5::yeah cause lebron is winning ever single year till he retires
Stanley5826::Melo will never win a chip while lebron is still around.
Stanley5826::If he only play another 5 more decent years. I'll be contented as long as he plays his heart out and the best that he can be.
Dawan208::Yawn!  Is that all you got!
Yu_Darvish_and_Ichiro::Where are "Knicks fans" when Yao played for the Rockets?
rickobeast::YAO IS NOT AMERICAN U $@%!$@.
Yu_Darvish_and_Ichiro::Did I say that he is American?
rEdBuLxTaSy::"OMG MY KNICKS OF 30 YEARS ARE FINALLY EMBRACING EACH OTHER...I'M SO TEARY EYE RIGHT NOW"  ~~ DELUSIONAL KNICKS FANS :):):)
cfylong::Lins top scores mo betta than Felton,Lowry, dragic,so sure is possible.
rickobeast::LOCKER ROOM DOGFIGHT WILLL APPEAL SOON WAIT N C.
gerald_5::i think lin has the potencial to be a top 5 PG in the league  - delusional lin fans
Stanley5826::I think he's top 20 pg now. Hoping he'll break into top 10 soon.
rEdBuLxTaSy::OOOPS YOU'RE EXPOSED!!! THOSE ARE ACTUALLY DELUSIONAL KNICKS FANS PRETENDING TO BE LIN FANS :):):)
Yu_Darvish_and_Ichiro::Can't wait for the Knicks nation to collapse after another miserable season
woopzzzz::clearly rockets coaching need to figure out how to play lin and harden together. i say lin comes off the bench. let toney douglas start but lin plays starter minutes
woopzzzz::all you lin haters were missing yesterday when lin scored 38 against the spurs. you disappear when he has a good game and reappear when he has bad game.
gerald_5::we also miss the rockets losing and parker goin for his first career trip dub
Stanley5826::What else is new. Lin played decent tho
gerald_5::only harden haters are lin fans  FACT
George7844::Harden is not only a BETTER PLAYER THAN MELO........HE'S A LOT SMARTER, TOO !!!
5856Rach::Don't try to stir resentment between Harden and Lin.  Harden is much better than Melo. All teammates respect him. He was very supportive of Lin the night he got 38 pts.  And today, he passed the ball to other teammates to help them make the play.
RNYC::Harden better than Melo???! Are u on crack?!?!?!  LOL u are NUTS
FLC-8R::I don't think Thunder's GM liked Harden. I guess he is a Lin fan too!
gerald_5::why would you say they dont like him?
gerald_5::lin fans talking about the knicks and early playoffs exit... im sure theyll know exactly how the knicks are doin see how the rockets wont be playing by then
George7844::I PREFER DELL TO APPLE !!!
Hank10593::It people like you who come to Rockets board every night showing how obsessed they are with Lin evoked the Lin fans to bash about the Knicks. Don't you get it? It's like Americans don't know why Middle Eastern countries are bombing them, it's because Americans are occupying their homelands. Get yourselves educated man. You are the one who needs to pick orange for life.
rickobeast::$@%!, I PICK APPLE.
sportsfan1014::lololol, so now all Knicks haters are all Lin fans, things just getting better &amp; better
FLC-8R::Knicks is the team that is more experienced with early playoff exits.  And other  types of early exits too.
rickobeast::N THE KNICKS GOT BLOWN OUT BY THE ROCKET HAHAHA.
George7844::gerald_5 -" no thanks to lin... it was all harden and parsons"    DUUUUUDE..........IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO SCORES THE POINTS !!! THE ROCKETS ARE A <b>TEAM !!!!( UNLIKE THE NY KNOCKS)  </b>
gerald_5::also... that has nothing to do with the playoffs
gerald_5::no thanks to lin... it was all harden and parsons
woopzzzz::i missed the game. how was it?
GeorgeTownDC29::Rather be a Lin hater than a Harden hater. Harden is actually good unlike Lin. Sorry, I dont get on a players nuts for being an asian/harvard grad lol but have fun with him.
buimonster::No one brings up race into the conversation besides lin fans. Seems pretty insecure.
rEdBuLxTaSy::I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISE IF YOU'RE BLACK :):):)
largehrdsports20::Race only matters to LIn-Apologists. Lin's boyhood idols are black.
sportsfan1014::Harden has haters?
woopzzzz::lin scored 38 against elite spurs. he cant suck that badly cuz not many players can do that.
George7844::FLC-8R - so by your argument, Knicks lost to Rockets. so Knicks don't mean jack.  LOL----KNOCKS FANS ARE STILL BUTT-HURT OVER THE ROCKETS SMEARING THEM BACK WHEN OLAJUWAN RULED !!!!
largehrdsports20::I watched Pac-man get knocked out. But you're right bball is a team sport. So stop mentioning Lin's 38 pts since his team lost.
FLC-8R::@large  Basketball is a team sport. not boxing. No one watch boxing anymore.
largehrdsports20::@FLC  Mega gap in your reasoning. I'm talking about individual performance. Lin's pts didn't mean jack. The Rockets defeat means something: they're not making the playoffs.
FLC-8R::so by your argument, Knicks lost to Rockets. so Knicks don't mean jack.
gerald_5::he was great on defense
largehrdsports20::Rockets lost. His 38pts didn't mean jack.
rickobeast::I ME WE  ALL LIN FANS HATER DISH MY DICKKS1  --S JACKSON
George7844::IT'S SOOOOO OBVIOUS THAT YOU ARE A <b>REAKIN FETARD !!!</b>
largehrdsports20::These butt hurt ESL learners with their poor grammar are too much. Since when does picking oranges afford you a smartphone or an internet connection?
rEdBuLxTaSy::SINCE WHEN DOES PICKING COTTON AFFORD THEM THE RIGHT TO A SMARTPHONE OR INTERWEB???
rEdBuLxTaSy::JUDGING BY YOUR NONSENSE, ALL I WANT TO DO IS LOLOLOLOLOL:):):)
largehrdsports20::I'm smarter than you, Na-nah-na-na-nah!
rEdBuLxTaSy::IT'S A FACT LIN FANS ARE MORE EDUCATED THAN THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::DON'T HATE BECAUSE ONLY 7% BELIEVED IN HARD WORK :):):)
largehrdsports20::Well, you're a poor representative of those "more educated" Lin fans. Maybe, you speak pretty some day!
