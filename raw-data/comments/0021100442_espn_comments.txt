Jamaal 43::Hey Nets fans, want me to call 911 for you lmaoo !!!
TheSportsDude2011::Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Send D.Will to Purple &amp; Gold.................
Antiquity001::No chance Deron stays unless NJ magically gets Dwight.
rthaw44::Idk... he recently said he's even considering exercising his option for the last yr of his contract and staying... that's actually how he can make the most money possible next yr.  I know he's not happy, but I honestly think it'll take a lot for him to walk away from this new arena and Brooklyn.  I think that alone will attract stars.
KingGeorge53::Looks like it's a good thing to have Granger back in the line-up.
LABengalsHeat::Is Deshawn's statline an f_ing joke?!?!?! QUIT YOU BUM
ChicagoSportsFTW8510::Hey Granger thanks again for the fantasy points
Chenger91::pacers wearing throwbacks at home against the nets again?  Maybe wear these the rest of the year.  It could be a good luck charm for the Pacers.
Chenger91::fire the Nets coach, already.
netsbucs::two players that should be taking out from the NETS are definitely: Deshawn  Stevenson and Shawne Williams
epicbenz NJD::another useless game by deshawn
MetropolitanFan::Avery making up crazy  excuses .....NO MORE EXCUSES!!! Fire his  a.s.s
rthaw44::Agreed... I think Avery is a good coach... he just has virtually nothing to work with.
goalie1113::quite frankly, its hard to blame avery for the mess that is the NJ nets....
JordanIsNotWalkingThruThatDoor::<b> He cost the Mavs a chance at multiple titles.. He' s an over baring coach who runs a dictatorship.</b>
newellp23::Paul George continues to change games in ways that most fans may not appreciate. 5 rebs, 4 assists, 4 steals and two blocks is glue between Granger's strong offensive showing.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::ya, most of the time its true. he just continues to get better
Drew Z5::Deron Williams is having a great season &amp; has had many great seasons in the past but gets no publicity at all.  F*** Derricka Rose &amp; CP3 &amp; Jeremy "cat eater" Lin
NBA_refs_are_weak::"cat eater" the dude was born and raised in cali and went to harvard hes probably more american than you lol.I hate asians that eat dogs and cats as much as the next guy, but ill bet lin does too
goalie1113::its because he isnt on a relevant team. EVERY time utah made a run, we heard the whole 'is d-will the top PG in the league??'  kinda like how nobody talked about chris paul last year...
Jganon93::hes gonna get no publicity when his team has the talent of .500 + team, and are playing like shi.t
JordanIsNotWalkingThruThatDoor::<b> He will be a Maverick next season... He will then get his publicity with a real team.</b>
rthaw44::Texas basketball aint exactly new york basketball...  if he were playing football maybe.  Pretty sure if people want publicity they go to NY, not Texas... unless its the Cowboys.
Drew Z5::I hope he goes anywhere but LA.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::only way you get publicity is if you start drama in this league.its pitiful
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::who made danny mad this time? thats the only time he shoots this well
newellp23::An extra game off probably didn't hurt, but to be exact, he has been shooting far bettter the last three weeks. .425 the last month compared to .390 for the season.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::ya i couldnt see the game today, the whole team shouldve been mad two games ago after the third loss. not just roy by himself...
Taco with a Q::Probably the Pacers losing 5 games in a row pissed him off
Tylerguy4200::its so sad knowing that the only thing that can save your franchise is a player currently starting for another team
JordanIsNotWalkingThruThatDoor::<b> How many points did Reggie have?</b>
DPetro10::$@%! New Jersey this is just gay
Mets2410::dude relax ya it's frustrating but we knew this was gonna happen. this is just a scrap team thrown together to wait for Dwight and Free Agency 2012.
drftw42134::Wtf? How do you not see the clock running down?
TheOx905::Winner, winner NJ+9 with under. Whoo hoo!
Taco with a Q::Where were the nets fans saying they would win by 20 and the Pacers have no chance?
Taco with a Q::nah....
crimson-knights123::I think those were the Pacers fans.
Taco with a Q::I dont remember....some nets fan did
Mets2410::really who said that? lol
mlmay31::Fire Avery and Vogel.
Taco with a Q::ummmmm.....their is no way we fire Vogel
mlmay31::Yep. He doesn't make enough in-game adjustments. His offense is figured out and Collison, West and others are suffering.
Taco with a Q::WTF fire Vogel????
Tylerguy4200::Fire avery!
Mets2410::no
arrigean80::feel sorry for those people who took the nets ml...oh well, it's only money
swami30::vegas wants the over lol
Mathew8096::what di di tell u it went under
swami30::3 pt coming right now
Taco with a Q::your like 0-4 in your predictions...come by more often!!  I like to see you wrong
roy hibbert good kisser::wtf? is ur tv a minute late
iownamicrowave::o rly
MetropolitanFan::Good time to fire Avery!!!
Mets2410::unless somebody like Phil Jackson is available I want Avery as our coach. I'd like to see what he can do when Billy King puts an actual team on the floor. Not blaming BK, just it's obvious that this is just a scrap team thrown together just waiting for Dwight.
Dickface McCoy::Wins aren't going to happen until after the all-star break when we get a healthy lopez back. I'm feeling it...
Dickface McCoy::Why he's not a bad coach. All the coaching in the world can save a team with the $@%! roster we currently have
Dickface McCoy::Can't* woops haha mah bad
roy hibbert good kisser::$@%! it doesnt matter make up ur mind crawford
Charles74116::The game that never ends
MetropolitanFan::it goes on and on and on
Allen4875::if games were 36 minutes long NJ wouldnt be half bad
RDR8ER::+9 LOCK
Taco with a Q::Pacers win!!!!!!!!!
Taco with a Q::they should win...but I never count anything out
Taco with a Q::shoot I spoke too soon...lol
Dickface McCoy::hahaha
Charles74116::Nice Implosion NJ
Mets2410::how was that an implosion? they were losing....
MetropolitanFan::Morrow ya clown!!!
LASPORTSFAN..............96::METS SUCK
Dickface McCoy::Whats with the 96 anyway. I'm really curious now...
Dickface McCoy::...............Still not really
LASPORTSFAN..............96::..................Really
Dickface McCoy::..............not really
swami30::heres how its gonna go missed free throe hit 3 then pacer hit 2 ft then nets tie 3
Taco with a Q::not only are you a horrible at typing...your also a tool
roy hibbert good kisser::wtf are u speaking english?
LASPORTSFAN..............96::NO
thewolf1616::RICKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY RUBIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Giggity.iggity::Is overrated?  Keep shooting 37%, little Spaniard.
swami30::HOW D I WISH 3 PT GAME HOMIE
Taco with a Q::is it?
LASPORTSFAN..............96::Does That Mean OT? NO
swami30::woot woot OT
Taco with a Q::you wish
roy hibbert good kisser::"anthony morrow should win mvp! all the ladies love anthony morrow" -anthony morrow
mjsk_g::Wasn't the pacers just up by 9?
RapCity26::Still the inbound pass!
LASPORTSFAN..............96::Lets Finish Pacers
Taco with a Q::Nice rebounding Pacers.....good god
roy hibbert good kisser::good morning san francisco, this is danny tanner reporting.
Denis2224::Paul George in the dunk contest!
Jthizz69::he should win. the only thing im worried about is people voting for shumpert just because jeremy lin is going to alley oop it to him or something along those lines.
RapCity26::Only down 5 lol.
crimson-knights123::Like I said at halftime, we will blow it in the 4th quarter.
crimson-knights123::"Don't worry, we will blow this lead"
Allen4875::they should write that on the back of the jerseys
TomBradyisoverrated::DWill is a bad man.
Taco with a Q::Come on Pacers!!!  Play smart ball now!!!!!
Jthizz69::Paul George has played great D tonight. And lol at Pacers having a team Water. my $0.02.
RapCity26::20 TURNOVERS!
Allen4875::15 offensive board allowed
Mets2410::they can't rebound for $@%!. never have, never will. Brook will make things better but not a ton
