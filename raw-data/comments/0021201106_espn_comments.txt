LeHalfring::Look at the West laying down so the Lakers don't get in. What trash people.
Psuedohoax::Laker fans are hilarious! This is going to be a great summer.
Rumrunner66::Yep Utah winning a game at home makes sense.
mikeisildur::I mean, I hate Corbin, but it does seem to me he's improved.  He took Marvin out of the starting lineup and put Hayward in.  We're seeing MUCH more playing time for favors.  And he has actually manned up and benched Mo and Millsap when they played like garbage in the first half.  Yeah, he's still a terrible coach, but aren't these some of the things we wanted to see?
meats29::Lakers lose tomorrow and they are done. You can't lose a home game to one of the teams you are battling with for the last playoff spot and expect to get in. If they lose tomorrow it will be demoralizing to them.
45386::Magic number for the playoffs is now 7 for the Jazz. Just an update for the Laker fans here.
mickscotland::come on utah keep to up , $@%! the glory hunters lakers fan and the kobtards
LeHalfring::You are a kobtard you son of a trick turning nagger as s licking pig. Moms face must have smelled after all that tossing. What a pig. Say T A R D again scum from a pig mother trick turning dirtperson
HisAirNessNo23::Kobe fans(not to be confused w true lakers fans) claimed they would steam roll the west and easily beat Miami in 5 or 6 in the finals. ....all that self entitlement has come full circle.
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::Let's get excited about the irrelevant Jazz making the playoffs just because they'll knock the Lakers out!
Darkflame07::You want to talk about irrelevance.....how is that Philly team doing?
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::They've been irrelevant for eternity, got lucky last year and had D-Rose get hurt...
ndcccc::being in the playoffs is relevant, the Lakers getting knocked out is a nice bonus.
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::8th seed is not relevant... although there have been upsets by the 8th seed..
ndcccc::Go Jazz! Get that last spot and knock the Lakers out.
jack frrom the titanic::Utah...pure smell tyhe fesh air while your nieghbors are friends.  LA...Smell the smog and get back stabbed by your neighbor
jack frrom the titanic::Jazz players:  hard working everyday folk  Laker Players:  prima donas lead by a Diva
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::nvm
jack frrom the titanic::Daren Williams a over paid stiff in brooklyn....thats why he is gone
jack frrom the titanic::Just like our fore father Joseph smith said in the temple....Good will conquoer evil and sin city LA will not make the playofss
JO3611::This is the only way the Lakers will make the playoffs;  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=5MhmGyZ7KF0  Refs, Stern, and the NBA money......
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::"I can't wait to watch Utah Jazz playoff games" -no one except Jazz fans
45386::lol
Serg Abaka::Spurs/OKC fans
CharlesRiver27::It's the lame Ute fans who boo Jimmer Fredette when he plays NBA ball in Salt Lake City. They can't fathom treating a former BYU player with respect, even if he is from a local school. BYU fans have never booed Andre Miller when he plays in Salt Lake City. But Utah fans are a different breed. Complete tools.
xenosapien::It's called a rivalry.  "You should cheer for the guy because he doesn't go to that school anymore."  Yeah, because that's what rivals do.  They cheer for the other guys.  /I'd rather bleed Red than cry blue.
mperry2879::Like if you want to see the Lakers miss the playoffs
Hank10593::Yes, keep the Lakers out of the playoffs and make them the most laughable super team of all times. I just wanna see Kobe's interview the day all 8 seeds in the West are decided and Lakers isn't one of them.
hoofhearted30::Kobe's 'guarantee' looking as accurate as his recollections of that night in Colorado.
didyougetthememookur::If the Jazz can c#ck block the Lakers the season will have been a good one.
Lebron James Biological Father::Jazz want it bad, and so does everyone else except Lakers fans. Lets go Jazz, only a couple games left, stay strong.
HisAirNessNo23::Wait a minute. .....mods deleting my posts?  Awwwwww
alandavalos562::Lakets! Season aint over yet.
Sarcastic as fuhhhhhhhh::Not for some teams.  For your team it is.
Im responsible for banning nbaistheworst::yes it is.

Im responsible for banning nbaistheworst::Mo Will is on FIYA! KoBrick aint!
Wadeverine2::The Lakers didn't pay the ransom money, so the Jazz strangling the playoff hostage
Alpine2285::The Spazz will leave the Lakers in the dust, they're starting to roll
dark_angel_007_bond::<b>Laker fans in the preseason: "Lakers gonna steamroll your teams! Fear the newest superteam! Lakers 2013 champs! No one can beat this lineup! Not even the Heat, the Thunder, nobody! 73-9 record here we come!"  Laker fans first month of the season: "They are only adjusting, give them time! Remember when the Heat also struggled the first time they played together? Wait till they blend in together and the Lakers will be scary! Championship, here we come!"  Laker fans after All-Star break: "Did you see that Kobe blocks on Lebron? That was great! Forget about the record! Let's just talk about those monster blocks!"  Lakers fans now: "Lose, Utah, looooossseeeee!!!! We need the 8th seed! Pleeeeaasseee!!!"</b>

Apriil Fools::test
Im responsible for banning nbaistheworst::passed! now you may start hating!
Apriil Fools::People in OKC fakk their own sisters
412Bart::Howard is going to ask if he can take a year off until Kobe retires and then he will come back so he can touch the ball more than 6 times a game, and Kobe is jacking up 30 shots a game. And the Nash will do the same so he can pass again instead of watching Kobe play the point also!
Sarcastic as fuhhhhhhhh::Nash will be in a nursing home in two years and Howard's spine will be almost nonexistent.
Apriil Fools::People in OKC fakkk their sisters
OKCFAN4LIFE16::lebron has been ring blocked by luke walton FACT

hockeygoon79::thumbs up because YOU ARE A MORON!
Im responsible for banning nbaistheworst::I know there's better things to do in life, but whenever I check the NBA playoff standings, and I see the Utah Jazz, led by Mo Williams and Al Jefferson, slotted in the 8th seed, and then I see the Lakers, led by Kobe, Gasol, and Howard, slotted in the 9th seed, <b> i just get so f.uckin ecstatic. sorry for the language. </b>
Sarcastic as fuhhhhhhhh::sorry not sorry
Beanslams46::Commish is using the jazz like a puppet. If the commish keeps the Lakers out of the playoffs, it makes his boy, lebron, look better
JWalk9267::commish wants to play the Jazz so they lose in dramatic fashion with the lakers barely passing them on the last day of the season.
hockeygoon79::you're not sorry.
Im responsible for banning nbaistheworst::meh~
OKCFAN4LIFE16::how is the 8th seed jazz fans LOL

Beanslams46::Nothing is funnier than hearing these scrub teams pretend the commish likes the Lakers. Haven't you scrubs noticed your mediocre teams are winning all of a sudden?
JWalk9267::I've only noticed that the scrub lakers are getting phantom calls that win them games against other scrub teams
