Podiceps::Collins is so full of it. He acts as though he didn't pretty much bench Vucevic in the playoffs.  The coach and management completely blew it last offseason. We're doomed to be the worst major-market team for years.
APHILLPS::What 7 game slide? Come on espn.
XanderMagicFan::I know rebuilding is a process, and a painful one at that giving where my team has come from in the last 5 or so years, but i'm hopeful. I love the hustle that the younger guys are giving Orlando, and i'd rather play with dignity and unity than the trainwreck and circus that Coward turned this organization into. There's kind of more than physical attributes being worked on in Orlando. Can't wait til next season.
bcumm69::Sixers are embarrassing!
A Moveable Feast::Please, please, please do not resign Bynum.  He is a bum and second, there is no way he makes this mess better.
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::Yeah, not a good idea!         ...... Rob Hennigan
Eric5669::Lets get to 20 wins Magic
dwight howards free throw academy::Getting 19 tuesday night.
slickwatts100::harkless stinks but vuc is killing us
DENIMCHlCKEN::50 losses here we come! If only we could land a lottery pick.
phillyman08::Think the Sixers could lend a tank to the military?
CoreyGallagherArt::Bad? Yes, this bad? No, defense is something the Sixers played once upon a time, that has long been tossed out of the game plan.
AceManCometh03::I'm not sure they are tanking. I just think they are really really bad.
Walter.White1::you can tell it's a kneegrow when his momma spells "Drew" "Jrue"
potato623::Go Toronto Go New Orleans Go Minnesota  TANK!!!
airicad::I love how the Hornets always wait until the 4th to begin their epic tanking meltdowns.  They play really well the first 3 quarters to humiliate their opponent (they've actually been pretty good recently)
JRT3z::Seriously my Lakers were getting our $@%!$ kicked and then we won its like they did it on purpose.
potato623::Master tankers
hyeonyyy::After all these tankings, watch us get screwed in the lottery rofl.
hyeonyyy::oh nvm, whats our protected pick
potato623::As long as we get a top 7 pick we will get a good player, praying for a top 3 though
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::up next  brooklyn miami indy portland la denver sacramento (away) utah milwaukee cavs (away) then charlotte (perhaps one of only few wins here)  rip sixers
potato623::'\        _\______       /        \========  ____|__________\_____ / ___________________ \ \/ _===============_ \/   "-===============-"  My tank sucks!!
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Not bad Tobias. Big Baby, essentially gives the same thing.
ballerbooboo::wow brought points with sixers +7.5 and they still can't cover.....such B.S
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::Drive home safely folks!
phillyman08::your name...it makes me sad :(
airicad::Thad Young's stat line:  26-12-2-5  If that guy had some size, there would be a couple blocks in there too.
CoreyGallagherArt::He likely wouldn't have 5 steals though
airicad::He's pretty athletic though, so I'm hoping he continues to improve in that category.
potato623::Yeah, he added 15 pounds over the summer, but you can't add height!!
hyeonyyy::Hope we don't get fined for this obvious tanking...
hyeonyyy::Jrue already got his all-star, he doesn't care anymore Helps with the tanking
DENIMCHlCKEN::Yeah jrue looks like he has mailed it in for the rest of the year. His ppg is down under 19 for the first time since before all star weekend.
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::Thad's role is to make it look like we're playing hard and being competitive (if we're making these jokes)
airicad::though Jrue's play has been suspicious recently
chris johnson 558::don't lie on yourselves
potato623::No no no, we just suck this bad
airicad::Some clutch tanking by the Sixers recently.
potato623::NO is the master at it though, 20 point 4th quarter lead blown to LA, we will never be that good at tanking
boilerup3324::Etwuan Moore
potato623::'\         _\______        /        \========   ____|__________\_____  / ___________________ \  \/ _===============_ \/    "-===============-"
potato623::Damn that tank sucked :)
steve_cronin61::c--c-c-c-c-c-c-c combo breaker...    ORL gets a win.
dross@cfl.rr.com::Philly makes us look like a playoff team. :-)
phillyman08::we out-tanked you ;)
hyeonyyy::Sixers are the real winners here. Soon they will catch up to Magic (in standings) and get a better pick!  EMBRACE THE TANK!!!
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::Tank for who?  Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis? hell let's add Luck, RG3 lol..  Nope, not any of them
chris johnson 558::we will lose more
Jcaff252::Philly is pathetic!!! The magic twice come on man!!!!
MagicBoltzRays::only joining the suns, detroit, and GSW have lost to the Magic twice. and now Philly
potato623::TANK TANK TANK
chris johnson 558::are we playing the heat ?
bronbronsdad::I quit!!  -Doug Collins
chris johnson 558::we should lose this game
MagicBoltzRays::10th home win. sad that it took this long to get it.
dross@cfl.rr.com::Want to see Collins have another melt down after this loss.
dross@cfl.rr.com::He is so pissed he let Vuc go.
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::Maybe he would've done it earlier when they had a remote chance of being good/making the playoffs, but things have progressed to the point where even the Sixers perhaps know they're bad..  maybe I'm wrong about this
potato623::Probably not going to happen given it's an away game and they played half decent
airicad::As a second semester senior, I can relate to the Sixers right now.  LOL
MagicBoltzRays::dagger
ShadowzCollide::How does Holiday miss two free throws right there!! No wonder Philly can't win a game to save there lives!!! They are playing a team that has won 3 times in there last 25 games in Orlando. Stick a fork in Philadelphia. What an embarrassment!!!
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::Sixers have lost 11 of their last 12 I think
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::now to be 12 of 13..
potato623::Yep
xkizarux::Tank mode fulling engaged.
bballdon32::I stuck a fork in them a long time ago
potato623::About 2 months ago for me :(  Now I'm in Tank Mode!!
steve_cronin61::intentionally losing to get better draft pick
potato623::Doug Collins calls it "well we are tired"
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::also called "tanking"
potato623::Tank mode brotha
jaykel0621::Gonna lose twice to these scrubs just in the past couple weeks!
Jcaff252::No. Kidding and got embarrassed last time just pathetic I'm even dumber for putting my money on them
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::Maybe you should re-evaluate who the scrubs are
depinach::jeezusss
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::"I'm ready for the offseason" -Jrue Holiday
RicoRed222::"me too" -andrew bynum
MagicBoltzRays::wow. that looked clean.
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::Jrue's reaction there if you saw it.. captioned  "Holy sh*t I actually made a shot!"
RicoRed222::if u add Nic to Jrue, Thad, n maybe evan and moultrie, we would have a decent, young nucleus....what if
RicoRed222::lol forget about him.. Thats y i said Nic.. maybe harkness too
Asknicks7::Even bynum
RicoRed222::i would try to work out a sign n trade with a team who wants em... Cant place another season on his shoulders again.  n besides, who would clear him as "having a successful surgery?"  the same doctors who cleared him last time? lol no thanks
airicad::don't give up on bynum... if his surgery is successful and he actually starts playing the sixers can't just let him go for nothing... that would be such a waste.
potato623::Thad is 5th in the league in steals....he's A POWER FORWARD...that is crazy
potato623::1st among PF's though, the stat I used was old, he was 5th in the league but lots of Guards surpassed him
potato623::Yeah, but he's small for the 4, so you could expect that to be decreased
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::0.9 BLk/36 though.. gotta do a better job there, at the big man stuff.. (atleast that perhaps)
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::5th???
potato623::Wait no he's not, he was before he got injured though haha
sponsoredbytwinkie::he's a small Forward.. just playing Power
potato623::Game changes, gotta adapt, hybrid 4's is the way to go right now, Lebron-Carmelo-Josh Smith  Just the way it is right now
sponsoredbytwinkie::potato623 - Yeah and....  He isn't a small forward if he hasn't played the position in 3 years, I'd like to see him at the 3 but he can't shoot for his life  do you remember the days when Small Forwards were actually frontcourt players that had midrange games? now everything is about the 3-point shot.. Bernard King would be ashamed
potato623::Yeah and....  He isn't a small forward if he hasn't played the position in 3 years, I'd like to see him at the 3 but he can't shoot for his life
sponsoredbytwinkie::he's a Power Forward the same way Melo is a Power Forward
potato623::He didn't start last year!!  I watched every 6ers game of Thad's career, he's not a SF
sponsoredbytwinkie::you are an idiot.. first of all see his position on ESPN.. last year's lineup.. Jrue, Iggy, Young, Brand, Hawes
potato623::He hasn't played SF since his rookie year...weryabeen!!
potato623::Really, how many games has he started as a SF this year?
sponsoredbytwinkie::yes he is.. he is playing Power because of lack of options with Brand and Vucevic leaving
potato623::No he's not, dafuq???
MagicBoltzRays::he's going to lead my fantasy team to the championship.
Partridge1150::Hell yeah same here lol
airicad::Most of the guys aren't trying.  Hawes just sucks.
bballdon32::As a Sixers fan, I wanna win, but at this point ill be happy if we lose.
MagicBoltzRays::career shooting game for Nelson. over 50%
Partridge1150::Very, very nice stat line for Young.
philsphan714::In response to DNLPS....sometimes Evan Turner REALLY bugs me. I just think he's misused. He wasn't the college basketball player of the year because he's not talented. He'll never be a star player, but could be very productive. Unfortunately, I only think that happens on a team without Jrue Holiday
steve_cronin61::philly struggling with the magic as if they were a team of Lebron Jameses
phillyman08::JRUE JUST MADE A SHOT WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?!?!?
DNLPS::Is it just me, or is Turner the most inconsistent, and frustrating Sixer?
potato623::Yeah, it's unfortunate  He could be so prolific if he was just consistent for 3/5 games
airicad::sixers really need to trade him
phillyman08::Thad young only good player on the Sixers now. Jrue is playing like $@%! recently
airicad::he plays well against good teams because it's to his benefit.  against teams like the magic, he doesn't give a f.ck
potato623::Yeah, carrying the team finally got to him haha
