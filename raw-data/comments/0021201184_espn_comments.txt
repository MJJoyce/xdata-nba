mcfail123::the refs clearly won this game for the griz. nba is a joke. I wish there's a new basketball association

YaoMingtheKing::It has been a long time since I have seen a game that badly officiated!  McHale shouldn't have stared the refs down, he should have gotten in their face and gotten thrown out.  It was some of the worst officiating I have ever seen.  The Rockets did everything they could to get back in that game from a 13-point deficit in the second, but the refs just wouldn't let us do it
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::CLINCH CITY BEE  BEE!!
TXtdo1411::Lin was only 5/13, not like he was on fire or anything. It's better than 7/24, but not by much. I don't put this loss on Harden or Lin or McHale for that matter. We had no outside shooting, besides Harden and Lin late. Francisco Garcia was 2/7 from the 3 point line, Delfino was 0/3, D-mo was 0/2. Our offense relies on being able to spred the floor, especially against a stellar defensive team like Memphis. The lane was insanely congested all night which led to Harden and Lin having trouble finishing at the rim. If you look at the shot chart for both guys, a good portion of their misses were from inside the paint. You want Lin and Harden, who are both aggressive players that like to get to the rim, attacking the basket. At the end of the day you can't say if he would have passed to Lin we would have won cause that's just speculation. The fact of the matter is we were missing one of our starters, played poorly, and had a chance to tie it at the end with a better look than anyone could have asked for. Sometimes they just don't fall, and sometimes they do i.e. Spurs gamewinner. On the bright side, our defense looked pretty solid. Harden actually stepped it up intensity wise in the second half with 2 stls and 2 blks.
NewAges::You should look at the game in December and see how the Rockets beat the Grizzles in blowout game......  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaMnOSWcUho
tungcn2010::Rox coaches were high on Anderson, why? bc he was a "great practice player". What has he done in games he's played big minutes? NADA... As indicated by both their coaching history, McHale and Sampson shouldn't be coaching at all... on any level.
SUPERKING_22::Simple strategy by McHale for any close games: pass the ball to Harden and let him play solo....  This has become so predictable for the whole NBA and why ROX lost nearly all close games in the season.  Mr. McHale, drawing something on the board pretending like a head coach doesn't necessary make you look like a qualified head coach in NBA. You are actually clueless on strategy and use of talents !
tungcn2010::Rockets' coaching staff are all blind in talent assessment. They had Lamb the whole time but just let him sit on the bench, all while experimenting with everyone else at the 4.
sacredbond::i agree that Jones is good right now.. Francisco is good also.. Beverly is the right one for back up point guard.. I think the trouble here for Houston.. is the system that relying 4 shots for harden the last 1 min. He took all shots.. and that's bad.. Memphis is surely ready for that kind of plays..
bassadilla05::..... who is this Lamb you speak of??  Jeremy Lamb is a SG, and we traded him for Harden ...
tungcn2010::They had TRob playing big minutes as soon as he got to Houston. They never gave Jones that opportunity until recently when they had no choice bc TRob and DMo (both of whom are rookies along with Jones) weren't producing as assessed. Of the three, Jones appeared to have the most promise. Of the three, he was the last to get an opportunity...
bassadilla05::Jones looks good right now. I certainly like his rebounding and strength. But the biggest thing with rookie bigs is that they have to know where to be on the floor in our system, offense and defense. The coaches picked Morris over Jones at the start of the season because of this. Jones had some nagging injuries before and after the all star break, and by then D-Mo had put together some good games. Jones is playing the best of our rookie bigs right now, but that doesn't mean he was the best all year while the coaches just ignored him.
tungcn2010::oops, morning hungover. TJones.
NewAges::Rockets' coach rather lose the games than let let Lin play PG....This makes me sick!!!!. I have been telling everyone. Rockets have hole in PF position, They can't win a good defense team without play fast break, uptempo game and only Lin can facilitate it....  Both Harden and Lin can not penetrate the rim when all opponent big players are back in the post. They only way Rocket can break this defense by run fast, and out run to opponents' basket before all their players are back......
memphis kingpin::finally ended the streak...it took long enough last time we won was when i was like 15 or 16 there back in 06 thank wish the game was on local tv because everyone wanted to see this. but why doesn't houston use Robinson he a strong as dude and aggresive as hell.
pfoote14::the thomas robinson trade has really lost its luster.
TX rainman::More like the Francisco Garcia trade..
bassadilla05::Several of James Harden's turnovers each game happen when he shoots a pocket pass to Asik. A big problem in Asik's game is that he hasn't been able to handle a high percentage of those kinds of passes, or he doesn't look for the possible pass. The pair of them have gotten better all season, but the Rockets really need someone to step up who can handle those passes in the paint. Chandler is better at this, but of course he was held out of this game. I don't like the notion that Harden shouldn't trust his teammates to catch those, and thus he shouldn't bother to pass the ball in the first place.
NBAProphet667::Lin is at the peak of his game and Harden seems to lost his luster a bit.  I really hope McHale make some adjustments.  Lin isn't a scrub, he's proven big-time player in NY.  I am not saying make Lin #1 option and Harden #2, but these are adjustments McHale has to make:  1) Use Lin exclusively as PG and more usage rate with Harden/Beverly on the floor.  I'm not oppose to Lin-Harden-Beverly lineup, but Lin must remain the PG that controls the offense.  2) Whether it's encouragement, leash, unleash, whatever.  McHale needs to ask Lin to give the team 15-18 shots per night.  3) Harden is going on a long shooting slump with high turnovers, both alarming numbers for a prime-time player.  Taking the PG duty off of his shoulders and ask him to concentrate on shooting and scoring.  4) Beverly's tenacity on defense should put him on the opponent's best offensive guard.  Take Lin off the opponent's PG if he's the better player and stick him on the SG instead, conserve Lin's energy for offense.  Although I would say Lin can hold his own on defense, but in terms of strategy, Beverly guards the best guard, Lin concentrate on offense.
NBAProphet667::Lin gave them 3 "Linsanity" clutch moments to even the game: 2 three-pointers and a sick-no-look pass to Asik for the dunk.  So what does McHale do?  Put the last 3 crucial offensive possessions in the hands of James Harden: result - 2 turnovers in the paint and missing a wide-open look.  I'm not against Harden having the ball, he is our big guy, but for a guy that shot 7-24, should McHale even call Lin's number once?  All 3 times to Harden?  Refs are not going to call bailout fouls in crunch time of a very tight game unless it's blatant foul.  This game is lost more on McHale then on Harden.
JLinNASA::Refs wanted to make a statement to the Rockets that they control the outcome of the game.    YouTube 2002 Lakers Kings Game 6 Rigged.  The Refs stole a ring from Sacramento and gave it to the Lakers.  Kobe should be looking for his 5th ring, not 6th.
YaoMingtheKing::Exactly! I watch every Rockets game year in and year out.  And that was some of the worst officiating I have ever seen
Dawan208::I thought Lin should of got a couple of calls on a few of his layups.   He should just go ahead and try to make it to the rim anyways because unless he's Harden, Durant or Lebrone or anyone with star power he's not going to hear the whistle.
Hoops Sharpie::vonsteve6868 For me #2 all time is not easy at all. A few names pop up as possibilities. Though I think in the end I might give the edge to Kobe. --------------  the only other person here tonight with their head on straight.  the rest of you, it's been a joke.
3rdCoastTexan281::"it's been a joke"  Right back at ya, chief.
bobbydagreat::I would like to say the exact same to you guy. You think Josh Smith is the second best forward in the NBA and that Kobe is the second best player ever.....I really don't know what to say to you other than seek help.
Hoops Sharpie::you just don't get it man, don't know what else to say at this point.
3rdCoastTexan281::I'm with bobby on this one, and I'm not the only one...  http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/doug-gottlieb/22000892/where-does-kobe-rank-among-alltime-lakers-greats  http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/news/story?id=4758457  http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/lists/Top-5-Los-Angeles-Lakers-Magic-Johnson-Kobe-Bryant-Jerry-West-Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar-Shaquille-ONeal
Hoops Sharpie::please dude no doug gottlieb ok.  the bottom line is that while it's not surprising that many people will always rank magic and kareem as the top lakers of all time (the 80's NBA era will always be romanticized), kobe would destroy magic one-on-one. just like jordan destroyed magic one-on-one.  that is how you rate the all-time greats against one another.
Bulls Bears Cubs::Hoops Sharpie, your logic is wrong.  Do you think Kobe can beat Lebron 1 on 1?  I doubt it, and where is Lebron ranked at?  not even top 20 or 30 all time.  as of now.  So you dont rank all time great by looking at 1 on 1.  Oscar Robertson, arguably one of the top 5 player all time, is a PG.  He will be destroyed by any 7 foot center playing 1 on 1.
3rdCoastTexan281::That makes no sense. They don't play heads up, they play organized team basketball where PGs match up with PGs, and Centers match up with Centers. One-on-one is street ball, and 99.9% of the league's players never played each other one-on-one, so who are you to say who would beat who.
Hoops Sharpie::i've read all those types of 'team's best players all time' links. just like the celtics have their ratings, knicks, sixers, etc.  but again, when it gets down to best all-time in the league, ratings come down to how they'd compare against one another heads up.
3rdCoastTexan281::There are two other links in case you didn't like that one....   Since when is one-on-one play of players from different positions the standard for ranking? Last time I checked, basketball was a sport played five-on-five.
3rdCoastTexan281::Magic is the #1 Laker ever, not Kobe.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::1.Lin 2.Harden 3.Parsons 4.Smith 5.Asik Bench pick ups: JJ Reddick shooter for Harden ,,Nick Young bench scorer,Jermaine Oneal back up center
bassadilla05::You are high if you think JJ would go anywhere to play backup SG at this point. He is being forced into that role in Milwaukee, and he is good enough to be a starter for someone.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::I think the Rox need a post up go to pf. A bench scorer and a back up center.
Hoops Sharpie::our best 2 PF's are Smith and Jones - only 2 guys that work hard and have a tough streak to them.  all our other PF's are pure trash.
Hoops Sharpie::bobbydagreat Hoops Sharpie - and another thing.. magic didn't even play DEFENSE.     Are you 5? If you actually watched him play you wouldn't be saying that.   ------------  here you go bobby, just one of many pieces from reputable writers saying how bad of a defender magic was. let me know if you want more references. oh, and i'm probably older than you.  http://www.behindthebasket.com/btb/2012/2/15/why-the-lakers-almost-didnt-pick-magic-johnson-and-why-that.html
bobbydagreat::Magic guarded everything from PG's to centers. I know, he's no Josh Smith, but he was pretty good LOL
Hoops Sharpie::kobe's not a 'flavor of the week' type of player and you know it. guy's been in the league 17 years and has played with all the greats.  let's see your 10 players better than kobe. and please do consider defense too, ok?
bobbydagreat::Maybe a consensus among Lakers fans, or maybe the national talking heads whose job it is to pimp out the flavor of the week, but most people who know better don't even put him top 10
Hoops Sharpie::no one's laughing though. there's a consensus agreement that kobe is #2 or #3 all-time.  some people try to push lebron for #2, those are the people who get laughed at.
bobbydagreat::Well you can think whatever you want to think, it doesn't really matter, but don't be shocked when people laugh at you for it.
Hoops Sharpie::uh no, he really didn't. at least not well.  he got destroyed by every quick quard out there and if you read the article you would see how kareem covered for those deficiencies.  for you to say that magic is better than kobe is just astonishing.
bobbydagreat::"still waiting for your list."  Kevin Durant and LMA easily off the top of my head and there are many many more. Sure your buddy Josh Smith is a good defender, but his offense is beyond pathetic most of the time.
Hoops Sharpie::typical in the box response. again, look outside of just scoring.
Bulls Bears Cubs::Josh Smith?  He is not 2nd best Forward in NBA, he is the best!!!  Forward that ranked BELOW him.  Lebron, Durant, BGriffin.. etc....   Ok, ok, I am just messing around....:P
bobbydagreat::You mean typical non brain dead response. Only a moron, or someone with a crush would think that Josh Smith is even in the conversation as the second best forward in the NBA.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Hardens shooting % doesnt really matter.
NBAProphet667::Nor does his 8 turnovers matter.
123abc456xxy::WHY DO RED 94 WORRY ABOUT KOBE INJURY???
Hoops Sharpie::why do you think idiot? showing respect for the legend.
vonsteve6868::He's big into basketball.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::He worry cause he worry about tings okay?
123abc456xxy::Every time harden try to hard to do everything by himself and try to be a hero, Rockets lose. THIS GAME WAS WINABLE UNTIL HARDEN TRY TO BE A HERO IN THE 4TH Q. 0-7 FOUR POINTS.
YaoMingtheKing::Get off Lin's nuts.  You would rather have Lin have the ball at the end of the game than James Harden?? What are you smoking??
fred3857::Again,again,again...and again,Harden's iso-ball at last 3-5 mins cost 2-3TO and scoreless kill the winnable games. If he can pass ball to hot shooter J-Lin at last 1-2 mins,Rox might have the chance to win this game.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Hes young but hes been pretty clutch down the stretch more so than not.
TXtdo1411::Guess you forgot about San Antonio and OKC when he singlehandedly won us those games. God knee-jerk reactions are ridiculous.
NBAProphet667::No his not.  This is a perception that is not proven by facts.  Even the previous night's "3" was saved by goaltending, the ball was coming out.  Harden isn't clutch by any means.  He is a great gamer, he will give you 25-30 points, he's a real deal, but he has NOT shown that he's clutch
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Hardens % will be 43.8 come tonight yay or nay
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::if u dont think Harden is a superstar ur blind..
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::He will finish with a under 44% shooting which is sad because he has played pretty consistant until this month.
vonsteve6868::Personally, I think the Kobe injury means the chances of the Rockets getting Howard in the offseason are almost dead.
Hoops Sharpie::even if kobe didn't get hurt, he wasn't coming here. guy loves it in l.a.  and that's fine by me, i wouldn't want him for max.
bobbydagreat::Really? I think the opposite, it means that the Lakers championship chances are officially dead. Why would he want to be on a rebuilding team?
vonsteve6868::I don't know. Hard to get into his head. But to me it seems he's not the type to think so much of how he will be perceived in the future, but rather how he's perceived in the present. And also how important he feels. But that's just a guess based on his behavior.
bobbydagreat::Being "the man that couldn't get it done" might not be the guy he wants to be though....
vonsteve6868::I think what's more important to him is being "the man" in LA and not having to answer to Kobe.
alwaysmile618::well for anybody who has experienced Achilles heel knows that Torn Achilles means that you cannot walk period.  My immediate reaction of seeing Kobe walk off the court is that he does not have a full tear.  I had a partial tear in my Achilles heel 4 years ago, and I heard a pop in my heel as Kobe did.  However, unlike Kobe whom I thought I saw walking off the court, I fell immediately to the ground several times as I tried to stand up after the injury.  Without Achilles heel, your body does not know how to balance itself and therefore you cannot stand at all.  Awful injury for any athlete, and although I am an anti-Laker, I do wish the best for Kobe as he's a hero to many Lakers fans, and nemesis to all others.  Without the nemesis, not much interesting scenes to be had, and a great loss it is for the NBA.   Good luck Kobe.
Paul Apoundstone::Great initial post Always - Kobe is a living legend and we should all be gracious to see this man play in this day and age, where so much softness and diva-esque attitudes run rampant in the league.  We're surely gonna miss him.  oxox.
alwaysmile618::One more thing, partially torn Achilles heel injury is just as severe, but not knowing the extent of my injury, I did play few games of basketball.  However, I was in TREMENDOUS pain throughout the game, and I am a person that is VERY tolerant to pain too.  Just to let people know how serious this injury is,  I also had a torn ACL in my right knee, and I was able to recover from it within 6-8 months.  After the achiles heel, it took me about a year to even to walk around without much pain.
Hoops Sharpie::kobe is a living legend, an absolute warrior and assassin.  easily #2 all-time behind jordan.
Bulls Bears Cubs::IMO, Magic will beat Kobe 1 on 1, if that is what you all are talking about.  Kobe is more athletic, while Magic is more all around.  He can play as center or as PG.  Why I give edge to Magic is because of the height.    Height will make a big difference when u go 1 on 1.  But, then again, NBA game is about 5 on 5, not 1 on 1.
bobbydagreat::Hoops Sharpie - and another thing.. magic didn't even play DEFENSE.   Are you 5? If you actually watched him play you wouldn't be saying that.
Hoops Sharpie::and another thing.. magic didn't even play DEFENSE. i know i know, it's a category you don't care about or even consider when you evaluate players.  and still waiting for your list.
bobbydagreat::Well I guess I shouldn't worry about it since you think that Josh Smith is the second best forward in the NBA LOL. Obviously you aren't very good at talent evaluation.
Hoops Sharpie::you're delusional. magic is a top 3 all-time PG, but it stops there.  we're talking all-time greatest all-around players right now and kobe is clearly #2. he's the closest to jordan anyone will ever see. it's very simple really.
bobbydagreat::What rules are we playing by? Are there "Kobe calls" (phantom calls)? If Magic wasn't allowed to be within a few feet of him then sure, Kobe would be better but come the $@%! on man, Kobe isn't $@%! compared to Magic.
vonsteve6868::Yeah, Bobby. I edited my post about that, but you were probably already typing. Makes sense.
Hoops Sharpie::so let me get this straight, you think magic could've beat kobe one on one?
bobbydagreat::Hoops Sharpie - please, everyone loves magic but kobe would've schooled him while each were in their primes.  LOL OMG, seriously just stop.
bobbydagreat::The fact that I have no love for Wilt wasn't why I didn't include him. I just don't see him as a Laker since he wasn't there for all that long.
Hoops Sharpie::please, everyone loves magic but kobe would've schooled him while each were in their primes.
vonsteve6868::Wow, no love for Wilt. But with those 4, you could go in any order I guess and make a strong case. Oh, maybe you're just counting their Laker years, which would obviously drop Wilt.
bobbydagreat::Wilt wasn't really a Laker IMO, same as Shaq. They were both with the team, but only briefly.
bobbydagreat::For greatest Laker? I go Magic, Kareem, Kobe.
Hoops Sharpie::kobe was much more of an MVP to the lakers during his time than the other elite lakers were
vonsteve6868::So Bobby, do you go Wilt, Magic, Kobe, Kareem? Or some other order?
bobbydagreat::How the hell would he be top 2 all time when he is only the 3rd greatest Laker?
Hoops Sharpie::bobbydagreat - I can't see Kobe cracking the top 5 realistically.  so you're a comedian too during your off hours?
bobbydagreat::Unless of course we are talking only about SG's, he's definitely top 5 for his position.
Hoops Sharpie::kobe and jordan are the only 2 guys with that unrelenting assassin mentality who can/could always produce in the clutch and thrived on pressure.  that puts them in an elite class.
bobbydagreat::I can't see Kobe cracking the top 5 realistically.
vonsteve6868::For me #2 all time is not easy at all. A few names pop up as possibilities. Though I think in the end I might give the edge to Kobe.
Hoops Sharpie::and yet another monster by jsmoove. this guy is absolutely unreal:  24 points 6 boards 4 steals 3 assists 3 blocks  now i'll wait to hear bobby tell me how bad he is.
bobbydagreat::No, he actually had a good game, now only if he had them more often.
Hoops Sharpie::still waiting for your list.
bobbydagreat::SMH.
Hoops Sharpie::all-around, yes he is. fills out the score card in all categories and the #1 rated defender. it's lebron, smoove, and then a long distance to #3.
bobbydagreat::I know you have a crush on him, so I'll let you think that he's the "second best" forward.
Hoops Sharpie::tell me who's been better. and remember, defense actually matters too.
bobbydagreat::LOL
Hoops Sharpie::is this a joke? the guy has been the 2nd best all-around forward behind lebron all year.
bobbydagreat::They are suggesting that Kobe has a fully torn Achilles, if that's the case, his career is over.
vonsteve6868::bobbydagreat Honestly, the real culprit was the zebras, but that's cool because I didn't want the Rockets to win anyway. I want nothing to do with that 6 seed. ------- No. The real culprit was the team. They had their chances.
bobbydagreat::Sure they did, but a lot of their chances were ruined by refs not calling fouls.
Dawan208::FYI Lin had the same amount of points and turn overs as Chris Paul. 17 and 4 respectively .   Lin was 5 for 13 and Chris was 4 for 12.

truth2dat::the Rockets are trying too hard to make Harden look like a superstar.. this is making Harden look bad because he just isn't there yet. Like Lin, Harden is a rookie too with potential to be great. Harden needs to learn to play unselfishly and stop letting ego get into his head.  Knowledgeable fan know this just by looking at his FG%, which has been terrible all season. People who look at only individual score rather than overall contribution are dumb.
SUPERKING_22::This is fault of McHale, not Harden.
fred3857::He just care about his stats.Many games lost mostly bcs of his iso-ball making too much TO and his no D also let opponents get more score,i.e.,the more he score,the more socre he give away to opponents.
Dawan208::He has a lot of pressure on him to carry this team  and it showed when he got frustrated with the call earlier.   I kind of feel bad for him.
