Cyril::Afflalo is now around 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists a game for the season.  I thought he was a good player, but I never saw him having this kind of all-around game, especially when you look at his numbers last year (3.7 rebounds, 3.2 assists in 36 minutes).  He is definitely maximizing his potential.  (But I'd still like to see more Oladipo, even when he's playing poorly)
JY::Why'd Nicholson only play like 3 minutes? Didn't watch the game but from the games i've seen he's been playing well this season
Anton::Nuggets should have never traded Afflalo in the first place. The dude is improving every season.
PKM::So Larry Sanders busted his hand fighting at a club a couple of days after missing a game for the birth of his child?  LOL
Jeff::Keep playing my man Henson.
BadBoy::The Bucks blow donkey balls.
mycah s::Afflalo is ballllllllin this season, he and KLove making Bruins proud
Rico M::Hedo Turkoglu is my HERO!!
PKM::Jameer Nelson needs to stop turning it over so much.
PKM::Bucks lineup is poop
