Terry::M.J never had a support cast like LeBron has in Miami = Not even close.
Anton::Heat aren't even trying and they are still blowing teams
I State Facts And You Get Mad::LBJ is getting the Shaq treatment from the refs, since he is so strong, players can hit him and the refs wont call a foul cuz he is so strong.... Now if that was KD, he would fall to the court and the refs call a foul... There was at least 2 times in this game where he got hit hard and no foul becuz he is too strong
PKM::Lebron and Wade didn't even have to play
Gary J::Where is Josh, oh, that's right, in Detroit.
Khyree F::What is going on the heat are blowing teams out  my man and them
Juancamine::You might want Korver to take more shots than Teague. Korver's been making about 55% of his shots this year, Teague 43%.
RC::damn...beasley was representing an endangered species...1 of 20 or so dudes worldwide still rockin the cornrows...RIP
Crazylegs Swam::picked up Norris Cole for the day and after the first half we can say so far so good.  Al Horford's developing into an animal.
nick p::so far pretty exciting, a new coach, a new system, new players, 6-4, and in every game, this is got to be coaching! can be fun season if they keep learning and applying!
