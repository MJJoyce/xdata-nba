Oaktown1029::Well, sort of glad Monta was the one with the big shot at the end, and not somebody else. The Warrior rookies (Barnes, Ezeli, and Green) have hit a wall -- probably expected. The team's depth has weakened because ot it. I'm hoping they catch their second wind.
CoryJBogie::GS isn't going anywhere, they have the same chance that the Bucks do of winning a playoff series
GetHype88::You're a loser.
Grant672::Now this is the Ilyasova I've been waiting for, along with Larry Sanders we might have something long term.
FahrenbrookCt::Bucks &gt; Bulls
GetHype88::Great win! Go Bucks!
d_bokk::The Bucks took 101 FGAs tonight, don't see a number like that very often
Ned Gerblansky::All Wisconsinites are Jews.
Grant672::Mostly Germans than Poles.
FahrenbrookCt::Um, huh?
GetHype88::Many yes.. But Germans and Polish rule the state. FACT.
squiddy45::Just got home from the game. Saw Braun sign autographs and take pictures for at least 45 minutes after the game. The whole time I was thinking "Jennings would never do that" and he probably never has
cyclonextrem::Jennings has.. he tweets where he will be once a week for a 2 hour signing session for all of the fans.
squiddy45::thats totally different. He's announcing it to everyone. Therefore, its a planned signing, and not during his own time
rented duckling::how's bogus doing
dreamhax::embarrassing $@%!$@ loss today. the bucks are terrible.
cyclonextrem::Chill bro we have beat the heat 4 of the last 6 times
soccergenius1894::23-19 teams aren't generally considered terrible.
jeff050578::23-19 in the east is like 15-27 out west.
Bocktor::someone sounds mad.
dreamhax::i am mad. there's no excuse to lose to the bucks.
Grindhouse2413::What the F Golden State? I need you to stay in 5th place and not let Denver overtake you so Memphis can beat you easily in the first round. Come on!
CAROLINAANNIE::Once again, the guards shot Golden State out of the game.  And Lee is pressing.  Letting the all star designation go to his head.  Finally, please trade Harrison Barnes to someone who knows what to do with him.  No matter how he plays, you can count of Jackson pulling him for his so called "closing" starters.
bigbirdbill::Jackson has no clue about Barnes.  He's the best player on the Warriors that can create his own shot and he plays very good defense.
mr porkchop::Henson didn't play? Why he did not play? Is he injured? Or are they showcasing Dalembert?
d_bokk::It might have had something to do with this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=u7tq0v2QoKo  But... probably them showcasing Dalembert
Miami-Star1::The Curse of Curry!
DeerandBeer3rdaccount::Holy crap Mcutchen got the cover for MLB 13.. Thats great it seems like MLB 13 usually goes with a American league player.
GreenBaypackersTV::yeah was cool to see that cover looks good
GreenBaypackersTV::just see highlights of the badger game today that end was crazy
GreenBaypackersTV::they came out with the list and info about mlb 13 the show last week and my jaw dropped after reading it. Thank god that game is only a month way can't wait. Heck they even have in baseball today which i have been crying to them to put in for years like the nba 2k nba today.
DaPhunksBack::hell ya, they have a super tough schedule coming up and have to win some of these home games to make the tourney
jzalvarado2.0::Why can't 2K sports do to Baseball what they've done to Basketball and Hockey (in the past).  heck even NFL 2K7 still remains one of the top sports games period.
.cha cha cha chia-::NFL 2k5
GreenBaypackersTV::till this day i feel sorry to any baseball fan that plays video games is stuck with 2k baseball
GreenBaypackersTV::jzalvarado2.0 - yeah EA did a good baseball game.  MLB needs to lower their licensing fees in order to entice some more companies to build a baseball game from scratch  2k has contract with mlb only them and companys that have systems can make mlb games but that  contract is done after this year so maybe EA will have a chance to make more mvp games next year at least i hope
jzalvarado2.0::yeah EA did a good baseball game.  MLB needs to lower their licensing fees in order to entice some more companies to build a baseball game from scratch
GreenBaypackersTV::i loved ea's baseball games also mvp baseball i played that to death
Ive Been Drinking All Day::bases loaded was the best
GreenBaypackersTV::you mean nfl 2k5?
GreenBaypackersTV::jzalvarado2.0 - Yeah maybe it was 2K5.. I thought 2K7 was the last football year (besides that one football game without the official license)  they had 2k8 all star legends that game was awful last good nfl game they made was in 2k5
jzalvarado2.0::Yeah maybe it was 2K5.. I thought 2K7 was the last football year (besides that one football game without the official license)
GreenBaypackersTV::im still puzzled at that 2k baseball looks like a ps2 game don't even come close to the quality of nba games
tamais2::Well i'm gunna get going as well. Have a good night everyone.
GreenBaypackersTV::later man nice talking with you again
Fuerza del Norte::Bucks are having a nice year, by their standards anyway.  But, nice is all it is.  I've rooted for this team my entire life and they've just been way too inconsistent.  There's no reason this team can't finish 10-15 games above .500, but they probably won't because they tend to have frequent let-downs against teams like Cleveland.
thoier::I'm assuming I've been a Bucks fan longer than you have and, trust me, 'inconsistent' isn't having one good year in 26-27 years....it's just called being sh__ty.
GreenBaypackersTV::other then 3 or 4 teams in nba this year everyone is inconsistent
.cha cha cha chia-::Warriors are an average team that's all. First round exit
Grindhouse2413::No Clippers man, geez
jzalvarado2.0::Yes, BUT not because they're 'Average' BUT because the Top 4 teams in the West are clearly the class of the Conference:  Oklahoma, LA, San Antonio, Memphis
DaPhunksBack::the Lakers?
GreenBaypackersTV::i still lol everytime i see morgan going to go play in japan. GOD help those fans they have no idea what they are about to see
Fuerza del Norte::Axford has a lot to prove this year.
GreenBaypackersTV::thankfully i think we will not ride him like we did last year if he comes out of the gate having issues he is done
jzalvarado2.0::We 'liked' Nyjer over at ATT Park in San Francisco.  I actually got a kick of the way he used to troll the fans.. Whole Postgame shows were dedicated on his antics
GreenBaypackersTV::i was scared milw was going to sign wilson.
jzalvarado2.0::'Antics' grow tired when someone is not playing up to par.  Brian Wilson is the perfect example in San Francisco.  They pretty much ran him out of town
GreenBaypackersTV::the problem is he sucked all of last year and did that garbage and just peed milw fans off
WIstormchaser2119::I still play MW2, just to complete the challenges, need a new game bad...probably will wait til mlb 13 though
GreenBaypackersTV::i love mw2 but sadly no one plays that game other then couple game modes. Kind of sucks in my mind mw2 was the 2nd best cod game ever right behind cod4
derek_510::eyy storm do pepople still play ccod4 online?  i was tempted to buy it for around 11 bucks at gamestop
GreenBaypackersTV::i got that one on xbox arcade good game
WIstormchaser2119::i just bought COD 1 from the store 2 weeks ago, remastered in HD
tamais2::And who is KottyKing?
tamais2::jzalvarado2.0 flyerboy? As in Philadelphia Flyers? ----------------------------------------------------------------- I get that alot. No it isnt. It's the name my 10 year old mind came up with while listening to "Learn to Fly" by the Foo Fighters
GreenBaypackersTV::lol good song :p
DaPhunksBack::When the Bucks win the Championship this year it will the first time a team has done so without an All-Star
tamais2::Cleveland? Quite a change, TV.  Despite popular stereotypes, I actually really enjoyed it when I was there a couple times. Seems like a really cool city
GreenBaypackersTV::yeah got a new job  start in may will be a change but can't wait
DeerandBeer3rdaccount::Cleveland is a great city. Very sad Sports history but the city is slightly better than Milwaukee
GreenBaypackersTV::jzalvarado2.0 - I don't know.. Its Horse country.. it just looks like its a few years behind is all.  Im just used to the Emerald Green Oakland Hills and the Panoramic views of San Francisco  lol
jzalvarado2.0::I don't know.. Its Horse country.. it just looks like its a few years behind is all.  Im just used to the Emerald Green Oakland Hills and the Panoramic views of San Francisco
GreenBaypackersTV::jzalvarado2.0 - I've NEVER been to cleveland BUT having recently relocated to Lexington, KY from the west coast all I can say is: Blaagggghhh  it's kentucky what do you suspect lol
jzalvarado2.0::I've NEVER been to cleveland BUT having recently relocated to Lexington, KY from the west coast all I can say is: Blaagggghhh
tamais2::I'm biased so I cannot comment :P  I was back in MKE for Christmas break, it was great being back.
DaPhunksBack::as far as what?  I have been to Cleveland and there isnt anything to brag about
Ive Been Drinking All Day::Can't believe there are people on the bucks board.  That's awesome.
tamais2::Well if anyone wants to play something sometime... PSN-Flyerboy10 , XBL-Flyerboy123 , Steam/Origin- Flyerboy10
jzalvarado2.0::flyerboy?  As in Philadelphia Flyers?
GreenBaypackersTV::looks like i already have you on my liste lol now i know it's you on xbox live
WIstormchaser2119::I'll send you a friend request on playstation
DeerandBeer3rdaccount::Ill add on PSN but i dont have a Mic. What game you play man?
GreenBaypackersTV::same here
tamais2::My PS3 has been mostly a single player/exclusives machine for quite a while now. MP games are PC and Xbox now
DeerandBeer3rdaccount::Thats sucks but ill still add
tamais2::For PS3? Not many multiplayer games. I dont have alot currently for it. The Show is still on my shelves.
GreenBaypackersTV::it's been so long since i turned on my ps3 only real game i play on it is mlb the show games
jzalvarado2.0::im buying an Xbox in 2 weeks.  Ill look for you.  Do you play Black Ops 2?
tamais2::I can, I havent recently.
GreenBaypackersTV::tamais2 - Well if anyone wants to play something sometime... PSN-Flyerboy10 , XBL-Flyerboy123 , Steam/Origin- Flyerboy10  cool will add you on psn and xbl i think i got you on psn already but will check
GreenBaypackersTV::is it just me or new bucks coach is so much better then scott ever was. i was so hyped when milw hired him couple years ago and i grew to hate the guy
DeerandBeer3rdaccount::Dont want to sound over confident but Sanders made David Lee his bitc.hh this game
jzalvarado2.0::not to diminish Sanders though Because I think he is one of the most underrated players in the NBA
DeerandBeer3rdaccount::i inderstand
jzalvarado2.0::David Lee injured his ankle AND HAS NOT been the same since.  Boozer had his way with him last night
DaPhunksBack::Sanders is turning into one helluva player, did you see him reject Kobe when we played the Lakers?  Awesome!!
mr porkchop::Monta have it all!
jzalvarado2.0::lol @ Stormchaser watching a Carrie Underwood video in the first place.  My Youtube History is "FOREVER UNCLEAN!"
Milwaukee Bucks..::im getting off. I hope to see some of you guys from the brewers board, be on the bucks board more often :)  peace
tamais2::Night, man
tamais2::There are so many penguins fans here. Obviously because it's Pitt, but there seems to be more NHL fans than NFL fans.
GreenBaypackersTV::im moving close to clevland from greenbay in next couple months should be interesting
GreenBaypackersTV::the thing about steelers is their fan base is so wide spread the times i have been in pitt it's hard to see and i agree i always seen penguins stuff all over
GreenBaypackersTV::i hope charllette gets hornets back they need it back
WIstormchaser2119::So, who's becoming a New Orleans Pelicans fan
Milwaukee Bucks..::logo actually doesnt look bad
GreenBaypackersTV::i agree but the name is dumb
tamais2::^
Ive Been Drinking All Day::PC&gt;Console
tamais2::... agreed....
Milwaukee Bucks..::you guys do know the Bucks are making the playoffs right?
JakeStein97::also keep in mind that there is very little playoff experience on the bucks
GreenBaypackersTV::if we get 7th or 8th seed we are for sure out in round 1 if we get 3-6th it's possible we could win round one
tamais2::We'll get in, but I dont think we are good enough to make it past round one.
tamais2::Only way we advance is if we get to like the #5 seed(maaybe)  or #4 seed
Ive Been Drinking All Day::Only to get crushed by somebody
GreenBaypackersTV::yeah and i think we can do some damage when we get in
jzalvarado2.0::I live in Kentucky,  BUT boy the Bay Area is an EMBARRASMENT of riches right now.  Giants winning world series.  Oakland A's West Champions in a LOADED AL, Stanford beating Wisconsin .  The Sharks look absolutely like they're in the best position coming out of the lockout (they had the most players playing overseas during lockout).   Apple, Google, Facebook, etc etc.
ARandolphNeedsPT::if john jaso and nakajima are the real deal...A's go from 94 win team to 96+...if bogut ever decides to lose the suit, warriors are playoff threat...never been a better time for bay area sports
jzalvarado2.0::You know that the A's are hard after that Cuban shortstop.  Bill Beane should be handed Executive of the Year already.  Can't wait for A's baseball
GreenBaypackersTV::axford can't even make a layup plz tell me he pitches better this year lol
WIstormchaser2119::we'll need a miracle
MafiaYang::the answer is...no
Milwaukee Bucks..::who has xbox and has a mic
Milwaukee Bucks..::this instructional is teaching me that baseball players cant shoot
OverweightNotObese::Mark Rodgers can shoot a lil bit lol
tamais2::But we all know that QB's can pitch
buckspackers23::Hahaha. Shooting is NOT hard.
GreenBaypackersTV::tamais you picking up mlb 13 the show i know you did not get last years
ARandolphNeedsPT::i bought a ps3 just for that game...goat of all video games
tamais2::I have last years, just got it a bit late. I'll definitely be picking it up.
GreenBaypackersTV::cool i think if i remember i added you last year but not sure would love to play you online in that
Milwaukee Bucks..::hahahaha ps3
GreenBaypackersTV::same here lol
tamais2::You see, I have Xbox, PS3, and PC. So i'm good on all ends of gaming.
WIstormchaser2119::Lol Axford Airball, thought he was pitching for a second cause he missed
GreenBaypackersTV::oh god axford
Bucks.fan.4life::Even if Ellis walks they should still keep him.  They can make the playoffs and get experience for this you young team.  Plus they will have even more cap space.
jzalvarado2.0::With the emergence of Jimmy Butler AND the s.uckage of Rip Hamilton, yall think the Bucks could pry Deng from the Bulls for ellis OR is that a far fetched scenario with both being in the same division
GreenBaypackersTV::when do catchers and pitchers report to spring training tamais?
Milwaukee Bucks..::march 3
tamais2::Feb 11th
GreenBaypackersTV::i can't wait. Once packers season was over i was ready for brewers
tamais2::Actually the 12th for the Brewers. The first ones start on the 11th for other teams
d_bokk::this guy really "teaching" them how to shoot a bball?
