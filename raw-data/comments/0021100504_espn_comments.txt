Nikoloz3::I hope this means Tyler is finally out of his funk, we really need his contributions to have a strong bench.
IndyPoker979::Honestly the biggest thing that I saw in the game last night.... Sitting in club section and realizing that the fieldhouse was only 50% full... come on people... come out and support your Pacers... we're 5th in the NBA and tickets are CHEAP...
CoreyBlair31::http://sportsblogette.blogspot.com/2012/02/so-kobe-broke-more-than-just-mjs-record.html  Kobe breaks his nose... and an NBA record!!
mwlevine::Psycho T starting to show some things. Good efficiency from the bench especially Dahntey. Let George Hill get back his rhythm and we should be a tough team when we shoot over 40% from the field and 3pt. Go Pacers
CandySparker::Go Granger!
JeremyAce4::How could there be an NBA game and the recap not mention Jeremy Lin.  That-sanity is-sanity not-sanity cool-sanity.  GO PACERS!
Hmrstrm::Larry Bird is building a nice team in Indy....GO PACERS!!!!
mike36784::I'm from the Bay and am disappointed in the Warriors. I mean seriously, can’t we get something going?  Wtf…

baziman 007::gasol + fillers for ellis and lee, who says no?
lsheiner15::I cannot believe the lack of media attention the Kevin Dobbs dunk has gotten. Dobbs is 6 foot 3 and did a through the legs dunk over 3 people with a blindfold!!!!! see vid of it here http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/

workman47::Psycho T is the true White Mamba!
Oaktown1029::Dubs will more than likely finish around 28-38, and get a distant 9th or 10nth lottery pick - not high enough to have any impact but just good enough to keep them in the same endless rut - one playoff experience in 19-years!!
iluvash52505::the warriors fans talking about GS winning and Indiana Being overrated..  HA!
lsheiner15::i know jordans better than leBron but this article did a damn good job of convincing me otherwise and now i kinda think LEBRON MIGHT BE BETTER THEN JORDAN, give me ur opinion http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
JeremyAce4::who cares?
comedy2424::DANNY GRANGER SAID THIS VIDEO IS THE $@%!. I SAW IT AND IT HAD ME LAUGHING REAL HARD. YOU GUYS SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.  www.youtube.com/tallguysproductions and www.facebook.com/tallguysproductions
Crunk Juice---UGA::Looks like #1 of 2 blow outs to open up the 2nd half of the season for the Warriors.
TDeans11::Why didnt Monta Ellis start.He hits a fallaway buzzer to win the game and this is how he gets rewarded by his coach the next game.Steph Curry isn't playing star him for god sakes.Jeese what is wrong with there coach.There coach probaly learned his lesson by only scoring 70 points and losing UHHHHHHHHH!
huffdaddymayne::lol maybe if you watched the game instead of reading the box score you'd know he did start
madflo30::Warriors need a center!
rodger strait::PACERS HAVE THE 5TH BEST RECORD IN THE NBA  GO PACERS
madflo30::Mark Jackson should have not said they're a playoff team.
madflo30::Only time will tell when Ellis is going to ask for a trade.
drat4567::Scores more than Granger more efficiant than Granger averages more assists more steals.
drat4567::I dont get how Ellis is terrible he's almost in the top 5 in scoring.
iluvash52505::Ellis is terrible..
believeintheblue23::@scunningham115 nah...he's garbage
scunningham115::hes better than anybody on the pacers
dustybakerowesme::No. No he isn't. Not even close. There are 3 Pacers I would take over Ellis. Hibbert, Granger, or Paul George. The first 2 are significantly better. The 3rd is marginally better. Ellis is one of the most overrated players in the league.
dustybakerowesme::Who cares. He is garbage.
FriscoWarriors415::exactly. I want to get rid of his $@%
geom009::Chris wright should play alot more scored 9 pts 6 reb in 13min ..
hvs1717::he had 4 blocks too
madflo30::C'mon Warriors! Play better!
eddy620125::the warriors are probably gonna get beaten by atlanta tomorrow this time by 30 points
KobeNoFamilyBryant::the difference maker in this game is that the pacers had paul george and the warriors did not
SB47-Locker10::LOL :) FUNNY
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::all the starters were good. the +/- is great from all of them
Brezzy T::Pacers still suck dick
JeremyAce4::says the guy from the san francisco area?
SB47-Locker10::BREEZZY PACIFIERS!!
SB47-Locker10::U !'!!!!! BOX OF PACIFIERS!! Mamas milk?!!
rodger strait::YOU SUCK THEM TOO
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::not really.
marcusshane4321::memo gsw , the cheqes in the mail, nice throw off.
Oaktown1029::Beidrins - 12 minutes, 0 points, 2 fouls , 4 rebounds. wow! he just keeps getting worse.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::and i really thought he would be above average
WarriorsWarrior::Good game pacers fans :(
SB47-Locker10::INDIANA HOOSIERS &gt; Warriors!! da truth !!
SB47-Locker10::WARRIORS = WORST TEAM!
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::nah. wouldnt stand a chance lol
SB47-Locker10::Kings &amp; Warriors joining forces just to make PLAYOFFS? PLAYOFFS? !! PLAYOFFS!
marcusshane4321::the warriors would probably beat texas tech
marcusshane4321::just
SB47-Locker10::THIS SCORE   :) LOL X 10000!!
eddy620125::The warriors won't make the playoffs for the next decade because they really suck
Transky13::Don't go talking about my 2k team like that! They have feelings too lol
WarriorsWarrior::Hey pacers fans how is lou amundson doing?  AND THANKS FO RUSH!
IndyPoker979::seems to me that Lou had a -7 point difference which was still better than EVERY one of the Warriors starters...
believeintheblue23::looks like Rush picked this to be one of his fifteen games to actually contribute good for him
Transky13::Haha, I feel ya. Gotta win someway right? lol
WarriorsWarrior::GG!
Transky13::You sir, are a jerk. That's the only questionable move the Pacers made this off season in my opinion lol
WarriorsWarrior::the scoreboard makes me one!
Transky13::Just saying, if the "garbage men" could finish at the rim, Lance would average a solid 6 assists or so. And yes, I do think he's a good player :D

Transky13::Yeah, Lance!!!
BigPage25::You know the people who bet the over tonight are pissed lol haha
Transky13::Dude, that's insane. It's legitimitely 6% lol
Transky13::No way *checks stats*
somaliangangsterpuff::5.6% beyond the arc.
ThaDestroyer23::The only "6" is the Warriors' 3-point percentage tonight.  (Seriously)
sports billy::oh well
Transky13::Yeah lol. ESPN said Pacers by 6... okay :P
Transky13::Also, Paul George needs another rebound for his double double.
Transky13::Come on Vogel, give us some Lance Stephenson action! He's better than AJ in my opinion
somaliangangsterpuff::Are you kidding me?This is why I'm becoming a primary Rockets fan.This is a team I thought was gonna be a playoff contender with Curry and Ellis healthy.Not like this.We're better than this.
dustybakerowesme::We're better than this? Based on the ONE playoff appearance in 19 years?
WarriorsWarrior::Don't remind me!!!!!!
mlevkowitz::Andre Iguodala for Monta - Do the Warriors take it? http://nyfwc.com/?p=3652
Transky13::Dude, if the Sixers would then you guys should be all over that. Monta is a great scorer, but Andre is better overall. That's my opinion at least.
WarriorsWarrior::Yes
dustybakerowesme::Why would the Sixers do that deal?
WarriorsWarrior::Not tonight...
BigPage25::refs blowing those whistles in hopes of covering the over unders
marcusshane4321::well well well masive betting plunge on unders this game, and look at the score. who runs the nba , vegas of course.
speedyjoes::What happened to Steph? Tuning in late...
dustybakerowesme::Foot is bothering him. Could be plantar.
WarriorsGO::Warriors held him out of game to make sure he heals 100%
WarriorsGO::your dumb. I have never Hyped Monta Ellis. You got the wrong guy. I have always like Curry more then Ellis. I think Ellis is overrated and hurts the team.
dustybakerowesme::You still on the Monta Ellis bandwagon? You were hyping him like no other last year. Should have traded him when he actually had some value...
