Judge Smails.::I dislike Bryant as much as the next guy, but aren't people tired of talking about that yet?  It was a pretty clear cash grab.  She had traces of semen from 8 different guys on her panties, he didn't need to rape her.
Get your foot off the boat::AND for keeping Nugget fans safe from the bricks.  Good job.

And, we can stay here, get the s*it kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb outta hell...  Oh, who am I kidding....we're going to stay in hell.

Bill GOAT potus::That was from before the game...where is this guy today?
CanesFinsHeatTwinsPanthers15::Kobe Bryant- “Smush Parker was the worst,” Bryant said. “He shouldn’t have been in the NBA, but we were too cheap to pay for a point guard. We let him walk on.”    “Smush Parker, with Tierre Brown as the backup,” said Bryant, laughing. “I’m taking 45 shots a game. What was I supposed to do, pass the ball in to Chris Mihm? Chris Mihm?”  What an $@%!$@%

It's great when my Lakers have a down regular season and we have our lil bros the Clippers to fall back on. It's great when 4 all star starters play for LA. It's great to be relevant .
CaptainClaw777::It is really great to make predictions and fail.
b-train187::Then you were never a True Laker fan if you're going for the Clippers when the Lakers are down now nobody is a Clippers fan they sucked for so long they just started winning I call it Bandwagon Hopping.
