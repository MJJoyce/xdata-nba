Dwight::The bottom of the barrel Kings would be in the playoffs in the Eastern Conference. The Heat are way over rated due to the horrible E.C.
Heart::I don't like Cousins because of his attitude, but I hope the guy makes the All Star because he's certainly playing like one.  One of the most consistent players this year, pretty much expect 20 and 10 from him every night.
JYD::Good job Sacramento. Beating Miami is the best!
WhoseWho::All ready making excuses for losing to Portland tonight before they even play! Wow!
Scott::Good win for the Kings.  Glad I decided to tune in.
Iron::Mario slash us tonight, That foul against cousins was unnecessary.
Thomas::This is like  seniors (HEat)    vs  FROSH  (kings)  scrimmage   game  back in the high  school days.
Ali::was spo trying to rest Battier or something....for once he played well in the beginning but benches him like practically rest of the  game. and Mario, I don't even know what to say. we sure as hell need some guard help to add to the  lack of rebounding.
I State Facts And You Get Mad::32 points in the first but only 34 in the second half and this is against the worst defense in the league...  The different between Miami and other teams is, other teams make most of there wide open shots but not Miami...
Logic::Miami would not even be a top 5 team in the West.
