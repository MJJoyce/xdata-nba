paul2285::Two straight games blowing double digit leads in the fourth, I hope the Nugz learn from this or it's going to be a frustrating season
Pusherman3::Denver is going to have a very rough month.   GK's small ball only goes so far and hasn't been good against good teams, especially in close games.  I like Dre but he is not the long term answer.   Use your talent, size and youth George.  Develop for the future.
jayeteee::Bingo!! It's not necessarily the team, it's the way they're managed. I've never really cared for Karl's coaching, it only gets you so far. Oh well, that's not going to change anytime soon, so it is what it is.
Memphis Godfather::GREAT comeback....Go Grizz!
nba is the worst::Nuggets needed to make their fts in regulation, but it's easier said than done.  Nothing inherently wrong with a road loss to a desperate team on a losing streak - a tough way to lose, but not that big a deal.  Miller's not wanting to be a backup could be a bigger issue - can't really see a short term solution though
BlkMexMamba_SomeBS::Miller should be glad he's on a winning team. Plus, Ty Ty is why better than that dude. I cant stand the nuggets. but Ty Lawson is the shi**
nba is the worst::Miller is still good - wish there was a way to get him on the Lakers (not that Lawson isn't better, of course)
diehardnr1::Wow....Nuggets need to find some 4th Qtr answers quick...two double digit leads with less than 8 mins left has equaled two losses.    AAA is just out of synch and basically cost Nuggz the game in OT.  Gallo needs to stop reading his press and start reacting better off the ball.  Ty was obviously not 100 percent...and Andre has reverted back to the old "I want to be Mr Crunch Time" Dre and turned a little selfish.  Throw in a butterfingered Mozy, Nene in foul trouble and poor clutch FT shooting and MEM wanting it more.  But biggest problem is lack of hustle the last two games....  Has the brutal schedule started taking its toll?  For all their depth, the Nuggets have been thoroughly out hustled in the 4th Qtr lately. Maybe Karl should rethink Faried only playing garbage minutes.  If lack of "want to" is all thats wrong then Karl is definitely wasting a ton of rebounding energy on his bench.  Better fix it today...cuz LA to DEN to POR in 3 days (again??!!) is not the ideal situation in which to find yourself as a team.  GO NUGGETS!!!
CandySparker::Good day and Rudy Tuesday.
AuthenticProphetic::Aaron Afflalo sucks. Got a huge contract for NOTHING. I hope he gets amnesty'd next year and the Nuggets bring back Wilson Chandler
eliasmelo::Gallinari went 1-10 and had 0 assist....But you guys say he's better than Melo. My point is everybody has a bad game, this is what you nugget fans get for hating on melo when he was playing hurt
BlkMexMamba_SomeBS::@Elismelo  Yeah, everyone has a bad game. But check the records. Melo is have a bad season
jayeteee::You're an idiot, elias, there's nothing more I can add to it, plain and simple.
cobrakai2002::They hate bim because he pulled a LeBron/Garnett/Bosh/CP3/Staudamire and soon to be Dwight Howard. Notice how ZERO white guys have "joined forces"?
Gogoberrymix6::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNBsg43cdTc&amp;ob=av3e
greg94327::not as weird as I expected the average laker fan to be
nba is the worst::Wonder why gogoberrymix spams this everywhere?  He's the star!
Iman Shumpert::andre miller and rudy fernandez are the go to guys for the nuggets at the end of games? that's not good
sharkboy2421::It was a good shot if you ask me, I thought it was going in...
JustineS04::Probably would've been Gallo, but he was a mess tonight. Sunday it was supposed to be Nene. I'm guessing it was Rudy b/c they needed a 3. Would've gone with Al.
JazzFanFromINDIA::Hate someone and Being Bad are easy things to do . Being Good is difficult . Take Care Denver Fans :)
JustineS04::I really hope that after these two losses the Nuggets learn to put teams away in the 4th quarter. Brutal.
JustineS04::Huh? The Nuggets led the whole game and were up 10 in the 4th. They blew it. No excuse for not turning a 10 point lead in the 4th into a win.
Jthizz69::I think the Clips put you guys away the whole game, never had a chance to put us away.
Tkw2008::What would erase these 2 games is to go into LA and beat the Clippers, how about some pay back!!
JustineS04::Need a healthy Lawson if Gallo is going to be invisible. They look really slow without Ty pushing the pace.
JustineS04::Especially since they should have the physical advantage in the 4th. I wish GK would give the rookies a few minutes to really keep everyone fresh. In my mind, Julyan Stone has proven he should get a few minutes a game.
Tkw2008::Just like the Clipper game, have the lead most of the game and then give it away!  I think tonight they had the lead ONCE 19-18  Thats horrible!!  Win the darn games in the 4th quarter!!
JustineS04::Umm, they were up most of the game and then decided to take a nap.
broncosroxnuggz::cant push the pace in close games. They become half court games .Gotta execute in the half court
broncosroxnuggz::And why does andre miller think hes michael jordan late in games ? Trying to take tony allen 1 on 1 .What a joke
Tkw2008::I think Andre Miller is an awesome passer, and thats about it, we missed 4 free throws late in that game, that beat us right there, Miller missed 3!!
JazzFanFromINDIA::Good Game Denver !!!  Better Luck Next Time :)
Tkw2008::Jazz fans YUCK!!!  Best NBA game I can remember  JORDON hitting that shot in the finals!!!
JazzFanFromINDIA::Yea !! That was an awesome shot . :)
GerardoE303::George Karl in the Western conference finals had Anothy Carter! 6 foot 1!!!!! ANTHONY CARTER inbound the ball against 6 FOOT 9 LAMAR ODOM!!!!!!!!!! and guess what happends? ANTHONY CARTER commits a turnover!!!!!!
GerardoE303::i noticed when we lost the western conference finals that were NEVER going to win a championship with him as out coach..... SCOTT BROOKS ALSO OUT COACHED HIM LAST YEAR IN THE PLAYOOFS TOO!!!!
GerardoE303::HE NEEDS TO GO!!!! BUT THE FRONT OFFICE WONT DO IT!! WERE STUCK WITH HIM FOR ANOTHER 3 YEARS!!!!!!
broncosroxnuggz::he will coach here as long as he wants too
Tkw2008::Another sickening moment for Nugget fans!
Tkw2008::Is Greys a re run on Thursday?  If not I don't believe I will waste my time watching the game, I CAN'T take these 4th quarter losses!!!
Kamikazi02::Losing a game like this and next up LoBB Clippers on National TV.... I think we've in trouble. I'm looking forward to the Superbowl. lol
GerardoE303::George KArl when he calls timeout and is talking to the players: "HEY gentlemen play defense and push the pace" i can do that sh.it and were paying him 4million a season? wow HE NEEDS TO GO !!!!!!
__Ivan Johnson__::(0__0)
AuthenticProphetic::._.
Slurm Soda::O_o
broncosroxnuggz::Thats a bad loss.I cant figure out why the nuggets play 2 point guards on defense when they need to get a stop and a rebound.
Tkw2008::Thats the George Karl way!
Kamikazi02::The head coach knows... :(
broncosroxnuggz::play brewer on defense and two points on offense if you want too.When theres less than a minute to go it makes no sense having them in on defense.Especially ty who was awful all night
GerardoE303::GEORGE KARL NEEDS TO GO!!!! SECOND GAME IN A ROW WE HAVE LOST BECASUE OF HIM!!!!!  GEORGE KARL NEEDS TO GO!!!! SECOND GAME IN A ROW WE HAVE LOST BECASUE OF HIM!!!!!  GEORGE KARL NEEDS TO GO!!!! SECOND GAME IN A ROW WE HAVE LOST BECASUE OF HIM!!!!!  GEORGE KARL NEEDS TO GO!!!! SECOND GAME IN A ROW WE HAVE LOST BECASUE OF HIM!!!!!  GEORGE KARL NEEDS TO GO!!!!

Slurm Soda::lmao

Slurm Soda::whaaaaat???
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::I'm going to go cry myself to sleep. And then dream about Danilo Gallinari. Good night ya'll....See ya Thursday. Go Nuggets!
JustineS04::I hope he plays better in your dreams.
bmosheman::Do you remember when <b>mr-steal-yo-gurl_84</b> used to work the boards?  That guy could troll.  But these kids today...they got not style.
Slurm Soda::Performances like this make me want to <b> <u> VOMIT</u></b>
Kamikazi02::As a diehard fan and I don't even live in Co anymore!!! :(
Tkw2008::Just makes me sick, how in the world can they go 5-0 in 7 days on the road, then lose at HOME?  Then play a game like they did tonight.  Another very disappointing loss!!
Kamikazi02::trying to get some vodka right now... lol

phatty3327::Stop with the got to guy BS!  Ny has two and sucks.  Nuggets have won two in overtime
BRDenverFan626::Look up, Lakers beating Charlotte 44-28 in the 2nd. lol CHA, calling themselves an NBA tam.
bmosheman::I'm telling you, if JR was back we'd still lose but at least hs sister would be in the stands choking some mother f*ckers out
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::I miss KMart. We would have won this game with him, no doubt about it.
BRDenverFan626::Ah, just when we thought Gallo was becoming a legit scorer, he has another terrible shooting slump. There is just nothin like watching that smoooth italian stroke clang off iron!
GatUchiha1::He did the same thing in NY. Really good games followed by weak performances. About as inconsistent as they come.
Kamikazi02::I still think GK should have stick with him in the overtime... Bad GK. lol
GerardoE303::for all you guys that are saying George karl is not the problem HE IS!!!! he doesnt play faired, he goes with a 2 guard line up, goes small for too much time, plays mind games with players!!! theres a reason y he hasnt won a championship in 24 YEARS!!! and there is also a reason why a lot of players, not just JR and melo did not like playing for him!!!!! HES OVERRATTED AND HE IS HOLDING BACK THIS TEAM!!!!!!
Kamikazi02::I agree to a degree!!!
Tkw2008::Lets get the billboard guys out and get a sign put up.  FIRE GEORGE KARL!!  I have watched NBA for years, is their a coach out there that likes to save his time outs, sets on the bench emotionless more then Karl?
Tkw2008::THANK YOU!! Well said!!!
Slurm Soda::<b> FARIED WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE REBOUND FROM TONY ALLEN. <u> FACT</u></b>
Scrambler728::Faried's offensive production would be way less than Nene's FACT.
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::<b>TRUTH</b>
bennnnnba::if slurm turns into a spammer, i will never sign in to the boards again.
Slurm Soda::<b> THAT WOULD BE DISGRACEFUL </b>
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::<b>THAT WOULD BE DISGUSTING</b>
pouha99::i have to say..the nuggets arent going anywhere until they find a go to guy to take over when they need it. gallo seems to fade away when it comes to these situations. they need a STAR to take the last shot and take over when needed.this team is a bunch of good 2nd tire players but none are stepping up
pouha99::he is the biggest scrub on earth do not tell me he is a all-star
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::Al Harrington :D
wickd24::Nene acts like that ball is Kryptonite when its crunch time!!!!!!!!!!
pouha99::if nugget fans dont like GK knick fans will happily give you MIke D
bmosheman::Didn't NY have enough in the Gallo trade? Quit when you are behind already.
pouha99::actually i think Mike D would do good with his up tempo offense and this team that you have
pouha99::exactly this nugget team is built for Mike D's style of coaching
BRDenverFan626::maybe with a pg as fast as Ty.
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::We had him in 98-99. No thanks.
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::<b>THAT SEASON WAS DISGRACEFUL</b>
Slurm Soda::<b> THAT SEASON WAS DISGUSTING</b>
Rhugh05::neither can win in the playoffs so who cares
BRDenverFan626::nah
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::I blame management for AAA's struggles. Should have locked him up before training camp. In a rushed season, missing training camp is a HUGE blow. Nearly impossible to catch up.
JustineS04::I'm hoping that his groin is still bothering him.
phatty3327::who cares its his job.  Catch up or sit down
phatty3327::please everyone else is doing just fine
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::Who else on the team missed ALL of training camp?
Slurm Soda::Still, he should have been practicing all off-season.
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::practicing on your own/working out does not get you in game shape.

Tkw2008::But that is the problem with Karl, he plays the players he likes.
phatty3327::GK is a great coach, most teams would be sub .500 with a squad like denver.  Our problem is affalo
pouha99::chill out hes a good coach, the nuggets dont have a go to guy in a crunch time. that is their main problem.
Kamikazi02::will then do something about it.... get someone or train someone to be a go to guy!!! just saying....
bmosheman::Not worried about losing 2 games.  It's the way we lost them that stings.  Both were in the bag several times.
Kamikazi02::That's our issues and games don't won in the first 3 qtr but the last quarter... That's where we fool around too much and get out off our game plan.
BRDenverFan626::Didn't see the game, but i know the nuggets attempted a gem tying three, apparently with rudy. Why didnt they give it to the guy they JUST signed for 4 years, 42 million?
phatty3327::harrington should have shot it
wickd24::he was on the bench:)
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::he was 1-10..but I still think he should have been in there...he can get to the rack and he is valuable on defense.
BRDenverFan626::Thanks man. Any idea why??
Rhugh05::Because he has not hit a shot since last year. What a waste of money
BRDenverFan626::Both gallinari and afflalo are not worth the money. solid players. by no means stars
Danilo Gallinari Man Crush::BIG AL should have taken the shot.
BRDenverFan626::He should definitely be a starter!!
wickd24::Put the crack pipe down steal your girl!!!
