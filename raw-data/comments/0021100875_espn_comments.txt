tank_dogg06::Collins continues to waste minutes on Meeks. 3 points in 23 minutes. Turner had 18 &amp; 7 rebounds in 26.
one way21::bucks will catch philly
AIadvocate::I beg NY and Milwaukee to keep winning and knock Philly completely out of the playoff picture or else nothing will get done.  We need drastic change and will have to lose big for anything to get done.
Michaelprestby65::Ive been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar for a few months now. I have made over 3k a month for 3 consecutive months just following this system. It's on the 1st page of Google when you search the words "sports betting system" Thought I would post this for anyone that's looking for a betting system that actually works.

Rick-Da-Villain::Can you say timber for the sixers season
New_York_For_The_Win::LMAO. 76ers suck big time
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Did Cornholio OD?
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Is Cornholio here?
3_ai_76::turner scored too much tonight, looks like doug collins is gonna give him even less minutes next game (if thats even possible) and play meeks the entire game for him to chuck up bricks
Chuloflow::76ers are like the Nuggets both teams lack a closer ( Superstar ) thats why they wont go far at all in the playoffs
sooner1980wb20::So I ball so hard motherf***ers wanna fine me  But first n****s gotta find me  What's 50 grand to a motherf***er like me can you please remind me  Ball so hard this s*** crazy  Y'all don't know that don't s*** phase me  The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this s*** gravy  Ball so hard this s*** weird  We ain't even suppose to be here  Ball so hard since we here  It's only right that we be fair  Psycho I'm liable to be go Michael take your pick  Jackson Tyson Jordan Game 6
thanbai206::i dont understand why with 40s you choose to give up the ball game... its 8pts with 40s
Sports junkie of chicago::Well Philly then Fucd up now......Bulls are on ur Radar
Victor6229::Can Brook lopez play power foward? Can he have the same success on offence. Can he defend other power fowards? Would he be a good fit in PF or can he only play effectivly at Center.  What if the nets had aquired a talented center.  Like Dwight or Tyson Chandler?
rhowe982::Wow 76ers Really?
Metropolitan7579::Brooklyn Nets sooon...woooooooooo
thebighallbowski2369::Yeah, maybe the Nets will actually win home games then.
Kev_010::D Will's going to leave anyway so no concern.
thebighallbowski2369::Everybody's going to Miami!
pistonfanstill::Where do u believe D Will is going? Miami?
D Boy626::Thank you Nets!
GrannyDanger332::Wow when is the last time the Nets won a game?
KORNETS::ur a faggggit the Nets are on fire i fuckkin hate tools who think its cool to hate on the Nets when they know nothing about basketball whatsoever!!! nets are one of the most talented teams in the NBA when healthy period
thebighallbowski2369::If only Lopez wasn't hurt all year and they had Gerald Green all season. Playoff contender?
NYturkeysandwhich13::2 nights ago...7-3 last 10 games $@%!$@%.
Malcyon1::Bold prediction: Knicks will get the 7th seed and Milwaukee will get the 8th.  They'll still get their $@%!$ kicked by the Bulls/Heat...
pistonfanstill::That was Regular Season.  The Heat are built to fold in the Finals.  Knicks have no real chance against Miami in the Playoffs because as the fantasy players believe Amare and Lin will be back they will not be effective
Chuloflow::Knicks got more weapons than the Heat. The only thing the Heat have is Lebron and Wade thats it Bosh is on and off so theres no worries there
Chuloflow::Knicks would do farelly better against the Heat than the Bulls for the simple fact Heat arent a great rebounding team and they got there a$ses handed to them on the boards against one of the worst Rebounding team in the league, The Boston Celtics
Chuloflow::76ers need them selfs a STAR too bad Doug Collins hates Superstar players LOL
pistonfanstill::No they dont. You are impatient.  Where did you have the Sixers in Pre-Season?
Chuloflow::they are a good bunch but lack a closer dummy
Chuloflow::Thank u Nets   -Knicks fan
Anyteaman::Bucks fans also
greenmagnum::No way is Iguodala still gonna be a 76er next year.
Metropolitan State of Mind::Terrible day for Philly, great day for NY LOL. Philly sucks and is a trash city. Have fun with your aging injured Phillies as well.
picaac15::Sixer fans, dont get too down.  Did you honestly think anyone other than the Bulls or Heat would win the East this year? We honestly had no chance even when we were 20-9.
grapenutz78::I see Andre Iguodala had a another stellar game! Is he the worst "all-star" ever??
greenmagnum::Sixers are lottery bound.
juno71::yeee bucks all day baby #ellisfan4life
picaac15::Sixers please dont get the 7th seed, 8th seed is a more winnable matchup
BigBasketBallz::You have no chance against the Bulls. The win 76ers had earlier in the season was against an injured Bulls team.  76ers may win a game or maybe 2 but I dont see the Bulls having problems with the 76ers
picaac15::They both play the same style- Defense starts the offense.  The heat are the opposite, and the sixers dont have enough defenders to control them all
ChicagoSportsFTW8510::You ready to get destroyed come may?
picaac15::rather lose to chicago than miami
thekola::the sixer team i just watched is beating neither of those teams
o.umpierre::Agree. Really disapointed
bballdon32::Definately.
gobaders::BUCKS FANS BUCKS FANS      We could make the playoffs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anyteaman::600000
o.umpierre::What is the purpose of Bucks making the playoff? Embarrasing themselves?
Xarr9::Just their hot dog vender.
o.umpierre::Let em dream How many fans they have?
thekola::2 extra home games not really gonna do much for the economy
Interim85::extra home games for the Milwaukee economy
Kevin276287282::76ers   just fold please
eaglesfan1723::Iggy being an allstar was a joke lmao wow
AIadvocate::I know I've been saying this for 3 years...he was a lot more effective as a #3 option to Iverson and one-legged Webber.  If I hear one moer person call him a "very good" player like Brent Barry I'm going to go ape.
the hawks is the word::That wasn't a SMOOVE move  Josh Smith &amp; Chris
SJYankee1::GG SIXERS NOW ENJOY YOUR DRAFT
o.umpierre::Are u a pathetic knicks fan?
eaglesfan1723::heard you the first 5 times
confused_person::Sixers are making a fool not only of themselves but also Prof Hollinger .. According to him they are the 7th best in the league, not conference the league ...
AIadvocate::Hollinger has always been a moron.  Not sure how him and Chad Ford are considered NBA "Insiders". Same with Broussard nothing but morons running ESPN basketball.  And then have to listen to hacks like Breen and Tirico who are nothing but mouth pieces for the league is a joke too.  Bruce Bowen is awful as well I can go on and on.
o.umpierre::Totally agree
Goku1985vegeta::Sixers suck! Wow! I hope they miss the playoffs cuz of losing this game! Wtf
Interim85::Tim Allen christmas movie&gt; 76ers
IAMpunter0926::LOL SNAP haha
TimDuncangetting1forthethumb::Mavs fans might as well start crying...no way DWill leaves this team now. Humphries, Green...a healthy Lopez...a possible top 3 picke....Gerald Wallace....and 28 mil extra and big endorsements. No way he goes to Dallas for an old Dirk and tissue paper soft Marion and leaves all that money on the table. Not a chance!
thekola::dear sixer fans,   it could be MUCH worse  Love, Wizard fans
AIadvocate::Don't you love when 35 million in salary COMBINE for 19 points and 9 rebounds.  GG Iguodala and Brand.  At least Brand has the no legs excuse.  Iguodala every game is 3-7, 3-9, 4-11...just an awful player for what he's getting paid and an absolute jerk to match.
the hawks is the word::at least you can get leads Love, Bobcat fans
eaglesfan1723::^^^^^^^Exactly.
PennSportsGuy::no it cant,  The sixers will always be the 7th or 8th seed.  Never get out of the first round.  Always picking 18th
thekola::wizard front office is a joke. they could win the lottery every year and waste it.
o.umpierre::I'm embarrased From pretending to be the third best team in the conference to loosing in Phillie to the Nets. Cannot get lower than this
FEAR_THE_HEAT::Suxers trying to run from the Heat lol
aster513::thank you for not fouling philly
Goku1985vegeta::I hope these sorry sixers will miss the playoffs! That'll make me so happy! I hate the sixers with a passion! These f@gs would get killed in a playoffs series! F*ggots can't score! Fuccing f@gs! Wow!
eaglesfan1723::This is what happens when you dont have a superstar to take over
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::Wow Gerald Green.  The Lakers had him....LOL
Interim85::Iverson to represent the 76ers at the draft lottery this year?
SJYankee1::LETTING THE NETS BEAT YOU ON YOUR COURT SMH  GG PHILLY LOTTERY TIME
Thurmonatorrr41::So I guess the Nets arnt getting that top 3 protected pick from the Blazers? LOL
andrewj52::SMH 76ERS LOL
foyeraylowrynardi::Mike Missanelli on 97.5. Bet farm on Sixers ml -900. And that guy gets paid to talk sports all day.
pappydiving222::Sucker play!
Interim85::At least the Flyers came back again
