TP::Many kept saying Warriors cannot fill the Jack/Landry void, I'll say they were more than filled with Iggy and O'Neal.   Davis and Anderson down the road will be one strong interior presence. Down the line if they consider trading anyone, it should be Gordon.
Carlos::anyone thinking that anthony davis production is falling now that ryan anderson is back?
Robert Z::Jermaine O'Neal,what a game!
Jim H::anyone think the asik for Anderson trade has any merit?
CYRUS C::Draymond Green must hate Anthony Davis
Todd C::#$%$ john.Warriors will WIN!!!
Some::should have just ship NO to seattle. bring back the Supersonics!
junbinoy::knock on wood on the cross of Jesus ...it work :)
Anton::Reverse home-cooking...13 FTs for home team is just really really bad...heck, Durant and Harden averages that many FTs per game.
TR3S::Jermaine O'neal played good on the court, but what was more impressive was his post game interview.  #TrueLeader
