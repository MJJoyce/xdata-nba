Joseph::The Utah Jazz have been a massive disappointment this year. Last year, although they didn't make the play-offs, they didn't have a bad year, but this year, they have been on a downfall and is now one of the worst teams in the NBA. The Atlanta Hawks fired Larry Drew since his coaching and philosophy was not working and hired a new head coach, receive new players during the off-season, and is now working and new philosophy that is good for them. The hawks are the favorite in this match-up no doubt.
steve::Go to Favors?  He has six fricken shots idiot!  They don't go to him enough.  Bunch of #$%$ on that team.  He was so much more aggressive in limited minutes last year.
BSupreme::Honestly it looks as though Favors isn't made to be a featured player and they ALWAYS go to him like he is. Jazz inside game is average at best. Coaches have to find a different way to use Favors and get him the ball
Heather::I got Atlanta. Utah sucks
Giovanni::I wonder how long of a streak Korver can go on. Is this game number 95 for him?
PKM::Favors has been putting up good numbers.
clint::is Heyward injured, because he is playing like something's wrong?
Anton::Are you all stupid? Jazz are tanking and they want to lose!
Ghost::I still can't believe we kept Corbin and let Hornecek go.
Curtis::The Jazz have a good chance of winning their second game in a row on the road today. I think Atlanta is a good team but they are ripe for the picking today. Lets go Jazz nation.
