lukew2380::Blake Griffin for MVP. By the time he retires, he'll have more highlights than Jordan ever did! Blake will do better in the playoffs than LeChoke, Guaranteed!
ARTEST.ELBOWED.ALIBABA::Jordan's highlights were championships...not dunks...you are so ignorant
Jai22T::Bigs I will take over BG,KG,TimmyD,Bynum,DHoward,Marc Gasol,ZBo,Dirk,JNoah,KLove,Big Al LAldridge and yes i said it Paul Millsap.BG is 50% from the line,u cant go to him at the end of games....
gt1master_ike::Grizz are not the same team as last year. Outside of gay and mayo, they have no one who can shoot which congests the paint. And their interior scoring which was an advantage last year is no longer that with z bo looking like a shell of himself for most of the season.  The only thing they have gotten better at is defending but defense matters not when you can't score. CLips in 6, probably 7.
ASIK_AND_DESTROY::I can see memphis bouncing this clip team in 6 games..
INTERSTATE_20GA::Now just think, if we had Al too!!! Wait till he returns.....deep playoff run baby!!
mark35345::So much for the Clipper-Laker rivalry. The Clips could have really put the heat on the Lakers with 2 wins. Now, the Clippers will be swept by the Grizzlies: break out the broom!
pioms::Clips have given the Grizzlies trouble all season -- plus they'll have home court advantage if they win tonight. The Grizz had better success against the Lakers this season and match up better against them than they do the Clippers.
mark35345::Remember last year? the regular season doesn't mean anything. The Grizzlies have more playoff experience than the Clippers (succesful that is).

sokal-surf::Yeah, that bronze statue in front of Staples Center was a real low-point in his life...

SMANGANG::clips fans are nervous!!! get ready for an $@% whooping by the GRIZZ!!
ASIK_AND_DESTROY::This is a strong possibility imo
sokal-surf::Memphis will sweep. Too bad for the Clippers, though.  But it was a great run while it lasted -- runner-up in the Pacific is essentially a world championship to the Clippers.  Kudos!
Ryan Matthews you da man::Griffin balled hard, but the Hawks WILL be dangerous. BOOK IT. So will we. Bring on the Grizz
SMANGANG::Grizz will whoop on the clips... in 6!!!
igotjustasmanyringsaslebron::Exciting basketball does not equal championship teams, Sorry to inform "Lob City" fans  Remember the D'Antoni ran Suns? Yeah... My point exactly
ASIK_AND_DESTROY::not really^
pioms::Clippers actually play D though. They're more of a halfcourt team -- not a run n' gun team. CP3 is probably the best half court PG of our generation.
SMANGANG::trueeee
ustna::Bring on the Grizz...they have been less than impressive over the last 10 games.
mark35345::Yeah, the Grizzlies have been resting for the playoffs. The last ten games don't count!
Brandon Hayes-Taylor::Really, we beat you guys within the last two games... If we get homecourt, it's a wrap...
bombsqaud1::good win for the hometown hawks
Sparty_2013::Two players scoring 34+ points and you still lose. That shows how crappy the rest of your team is.
cuckooroller::Big pat on the back from Laker fans to our little brothers.  You made it into the playoffs and it refreshing that our City does not have to be totally ashamed of them for this year at least!  Many will now have to look at religion again.  The Pope has already sent Rev. Peter Gumpel to Los Angeles to investigate if the Clipper season can be considered a miracle...perhaps this is the greatest argument for the existance of God.
crondito::Its refreshing to have a basketball team in LA that doesnt resort to dirty play (bribing the refs like in 2002, taking out the one of the other teams best players), to win basketball games
1AKERZCHARGERZTROJANZ::I would say that I an happy for the Clippers and the Clippers. But they have been talking to much sh.it sense CP3 and Billups arrival. They've been as if the Clippets has always been irrelevant ,going overboard with the whole so call Clippers the new team of LA. And the Lakers are sorry and done just talking out the side of thier damn necks. I don't care about the Clippers having who ever or making the playoffs good for them but just quit with the bs. I never disliked the Clippers intill this year and its not because of no trade veto or because their doing good.
ustna::2/10.....weak
24stupac24::Well there goes the chances of the Clippers hanging thier first and only division banner right next to the Lakers 16 championship banners. lmao
cuckooroller::Only the most knowledgeable Clipper fans know where the Clipper Trophy room is.  It took me twenty minutes to find it myself.  You have to go out in back of Staples.  It is a very small room located right between the dumpsters, and the chemical toilets.  It is currently being leased by a few very overworked social workers manning the Clippers Fan Suicide Hotline, and funded by the Federal Agency, the Study Group In Mass Masochism.
Jai22T::BG plays hard but he has to get better,no go to move or moves and he's poor at the freethrow line.He's not a top 10 big in this NBA if u need a list let me know...
crondito::Ya, last nights game clearly showed that Blake has no offensive skills at all except for dunking.  He definitely didn't use multiple post moves, hit jumpers, make spinning reverse layups, and yes DUNK.
ustna::Ok... I'll bite. Let's see YOUR list. Make sure you include each players "go to move" and free-throw percentage.
wahzoo5::I thought the Clippers were going to run away with the Pacific?  too bad you can't count pre season games.
ACandOJ::Too bad dunks only count for 2 points...they thought if CP3 threw it from halfcourt it was worth 5 points like Rock &amp; Jock
scotthomgren1968::I’ve been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 3 months straight now following this system. I found this system by Google searching the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for  anyone that is looking for a system that actually works and is tired of not winning your bets like I once was...more
mmoore2144::Fakers are going down in the first round. Better watch out for the mavs or nuggets. Both are deeper than the Fakers.
wahzoo5::I agree, I don't see the Clips getting past the first round themselves.  Fat Albert is going to have to play his best basketball to just achieve the 2nd round.
ACandOJ::Have fun with the Grizzlies....
MemphisFan4Life21::Watch out for the Grizzlies! =)
Lebron is my friend::Clippers suck

Lakermagicshowtime::B ITHCES
Lakermagicshowtime::$@%!$ ES SO QUIET HERE
Lavender5226::Hope the Clipper "fans" enjoy the playoffs while they can.  Memphis will probably be too much for them to handle and the Clips will get bounced in the first round.  CP3 will realize he is no better off with this team than he was with the Hornets and he will leave at the end of next year when his contract is up, which in turn causes Griffin to also leave as well.  The Clippers will then be back in the cellar where they belong.
Lakermagicshowtime::2 words Donald Sterling
DavidStern_TheDevil::Why do you hope for this?  Is it because you live a sad pathetic life where you have never gotten your d%ck wet and the only way to get your jollies off is on bashing the Clippers.  ^^ WHAT A LOSER
Lakermagicshowtime::PAul and griffin will leave after next season
Lakermagicshowtime::whats there to bash?only polluting Staples?
Lavender5226::Not hoping just saying how it will be.  Chris Paul came to LA to win, if that doesn't happen what reason does he have to stick around.  And can you see Griffin sticking around if he is once again the only star on the team?
Lakermagicshowtime::BIT CHES
