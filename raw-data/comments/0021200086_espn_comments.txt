Excelscior1::Certainly an improvement over their previous games. The defense and the offense seemed a little better, particularly in the second half. The rebounding unfortunately, still needs work. Is the team and Green (who showed promise) ready to break out?  I guess we'll all see?
Road dog Red::Green couldn't find his footie PJs on Friday night... guess he thought somebody on the Bucks had stolen them cuz he finnally played with an edge
TexasLonghorns247::lol
suchita216::Jeff Green was sensational in the last 9 minutes of fourth quarter.
_I Am A Celtic_::Yea I wonder what got into him
suchita216::Garnett told him to go to the basket.  He made his first dunk.  Got mad, gritty and aggressive...and the rest is history.
_I Am A Celtic_::<b>C's!</b>

bradytogronktouchdown1287::Let's go celtics
ChargersFan4Life001::dogs, I'd love to see them get in and they might fight for a spot, I just dont know if they have enough experience and rebounding to get in. The defense is better but the offense has struggled. If the offense can get going like it did last year and the defense stays good, then it's very possible
Marcus -Pick Six- Sherels::Kings have a good team in my opinion
ChargersFan4Life001::if they can get the offense better, pass it more, and keep up the solid defense all year then its very possible. I'll take an 8th seed in the playoffs over a lotto pick so I'm hoping they do.
