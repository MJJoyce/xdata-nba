Commenter::As a Spurs fan in the past and wondering what is going on it seems clear the Spurs must find people that will control the boards on the offensive end and defensive end.  If they don't it could be a long unprofitable year for the Spurs.  Yes, I am a former coach so I know something about basketball. The Spurs must work on screening out on the offensive and the defensive boards to get the rebounds!!!. If the players they have do not want to put themselves out to do the job, then bring in people who are strong and aggressive that will do the job.  To win consistently one must control the boards in every game in my opinion.  If the players they have won't do the job , they must be replaced in my opinion.  If  players aren't doing the job put players on the team with the height and ability and aggressiveness and fight to do the job.
shula::Vince Carter still plays? I'm guessing he's not exactly a dunk machine anymore.
46064::Go Raptors - need a win. Pacers fan here, but I really like your team and always pull for east teams against west teams. DeRozan is really good and when Lowry brings his A game he is a handful.
Buck::Well We got a lead and im panicking LOL
Rhinogold::Game hinges on the ability to guard Ellis, while Amire and JV try to handle Nowitzki
doh::lowry tanked and the raps still won. goes to show you how solid this team is
tim n::I love what Cuban has done to this roster.....keep Dirk as the centerpiece while surrounding him with all star talent (ellis) and good fundamental pieces ....marion, carter, calderson.....the 2014 version of the mavs will be a threat in the west....
Brian::Mavs totally going to win with Monta and dirk and Marion on a role go mavs.
Melo For 3 Clank!::Kyle Lowry looks like Kobe out there
KingSouljaSide::Raptors been struggling ima have to pick my mavs
