whoaaa::Courtney Lee is playing brilliant basketball.  Plays good D, shoots well, what a trade for Memphis.  They didn't give a lot up for him, but its exactly what they needed.  They needed a shooter, that could play D. No hate on Mike Miller, but they needed someone that is young and can handle the rigors of a 82 game season, an old veteran like Miller will be helpful for the playoffs.
Anton::Kings are improving and next year they will be a force with a full training camp.
James Page::6 of 20 for Cousins - that is unacceptable for him.   He tries shoots designed for shooting guards of forwards not for a big clunk like Cousins.
Herb Gravie::Right.  Jimmer plays a whole 9 minutes and costs the Kings a win. Outstanding logic! Brilliant!
Jason Hayward::This is an automatic loss for Crapamento book it..Love the demise of this horrible franchise...Of course DeParkus Crussins is gonna get his points,but what can I say he is an individual,and that is all the Queen fans all about an individual they love to lose....Grizzlies easily cruise to an 11-13 point win.
george l::Jimmer cost this game? Looking at the box score alone anyone can see that 3 shots and only 9 minutes did not cause this! 6 for 20 now there is a cause! No matter who is shooting!
kiki::Only 14 comments and most of them is about Jimmer. How sad.
mark::Jimmer can't wait to leave Crapramento. And after he doe's,he can't wait to come back and torch the Queens!
gdp::Conley comes in, takes it to Thomas, and they lose the lead and the game. BTW haters, they took the lead when Jimmer was in, lost it AGAIN when they put the so-called starters back in
KKK Killa::The NBA would be better off without both Lin and Fredette.
