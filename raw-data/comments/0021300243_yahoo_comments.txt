fup duck::Jamaal Franklin sits?  Amazing
Karel::Could the Nets actually win a game?
David::It looks like Memphis needs to put their best defender on Joe Johnson. He can be very hot, when he gets hot. you need to do everything you can to slow him down.
Dave::Yeah, Gasol and Randolph are out, but so are Williams, Pierce, Terry, and Kirilenko for the Nets.  The Nets have been injured all year.  Let's see how they look at full strength.
heinzy k::This is a fluke game.  If Gasol and Randolph were in there, this would be a Memphis win easily
Anton::A rare win for the Nets, and against a powerhouse team too. This is a start...of something BIG.
Iron::Sorry, but I don't care if the Memphis is loosing or not but the Nets will not beat them, I hope Paul Pierce will remember when said he wish the heat looses every game, well there  is something called "KARMA" and how does it feel to be in that kind of circle now?
Commenter::fire  kid already hes a cheaterand a turd
Ryan::5th win of the season..Yay! We had better have won..No Gasol and No Big Z for Memphis. Let's see if this win is something we can build on...
.::I can't sift through all these comments but did anyone mention how Zach Randolph missed the game due to an ingrown toenail?
