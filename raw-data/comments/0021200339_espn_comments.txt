HeatWillRepeat::Difference between 18 + 24 is SIX you UNEDUCATED MORON!
nba is the worst::Ha ha - "learn to count" still applies, son.  24 -18 is 6, correct.   But when the heat got titles* in the 18th and 24th seasons, that's in 7 years, as I PROVED  (18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 - how many numbers do you see)?

HeatWillRepeat::Count better than you TROLL LOSER!
jchincapiez@hotmail.com::Hate, this is nothing... As a Miami heat fan, I actually miss the hate... For the last two seasons we were the targets of laughter and poison and after each Miami Heat lost, the media made us feel like if the skies were falling apart... Every game had consequences, fear, and doubt... The pressure was so high that Heat players actually cried after a simple regular season game... But now, we lost against Wizard, then the Knicks and nothing happened... I really miss the hate... I hope we can feel it again during the playoffs...
KnixTix::As for no poison...you play no defense. You are still the targets of laughter.
nba is the worst::9 more days until the schedule toughens up - who's up next ?  Bet they're on a B2B

Mambaholic 33::Who cares! so F#$^&amp; what
nba is the worst::Apparently several people besides the two of us - is that all right with you? ;)
ron4317::Why quibble over 1 win?  The Heat have retooled, and Lebron just keeps getting better.  Heat are the favorites to repeat.
nba is the worst::You are incorrect to say that.  It's a matter of fact, not semantics.  The fact is, the heat won 2 titles* in 7 seasons, not two in 6 years like the heat fan is saying.
oneandonlybabe::They agree with each other, a matter of semantics but neither can see it though.
HeatWillRepeat::Get a life TROLL! Go LOSE some more money gambling on games you LOSER! Then you can blame the refs some more!   And as I stated NUMEROUS TIMES! The Heat WON titles in their 18th and 24th seasons! Thats SIX years to EVERYBODY in the UNIVERSE except an IDIOT like You!   OWNED!!!!!

HeatWillRepeat::STUPID!
HeatWillRepeat::Thats SIX years!   SUCCEED!
nba is the worst::So you can't count either, SeaMonkey? Or you can't read?  He said "2 CHAMPIONSHIPS the past 6 years".  (No "between" appears)...
SeaMonkeyTJ::He/she really is insane, no? He's showing 6 years between the 2 championships, then calling everyone stupid because 6 is somehow actually 7 in his mind. At first, I thought he thought he was being funny--now I'm just sad for him.
oneandonlybabe::Because he keeps using their years of existence to support his claim and that's 6 years in between. Anyway like I said, be careful with that neck of yours and all that head shaking, lest you get injured and can't play all the basketball you say you play.
nba is the worst::Why would you jump to a conclusion (as you so often do) that he meant "the years in between", when he posted nothing of the kind? It's obvious he actually thinks the heat won 2 titles in 6 years - that's why he keeps posting it!  smh
oneandonlybabe::Because that was my interpretation? Yes, I know what's going to follow: you're confused or you're an idiot (there I saved you the time and the typing)
nba is the worst::Here's what he posted: "2 CHAMPIONSHIPS the past 6 years!"  Why would I (or anyone) care what you "believe he meant"?  Talk about "irrelevant"...
oneandonlybabe::I was trying to help like I said I believe he meant the years in between? do you get the meaning of in between? Anyway, carry on and continue calling me names when I am the only one here who doesn't insult you at every turn. Strange man you are.
nba is the worst::Which is my point, "Mr. Buttinski" - since it was 2 titles in 7 years - as I just proved!
oneandonlybabe::worst, he means six years between the last two championships, not a potential third one. I believe, anyway.
nba is the worst::HeatWillRepeat - Thats SIX years!   SUCCEED! -=-=-  Are you really this stupid - even after I wrote it down for you?  The fact is it's 2 titles* in SEVEN years - LMAO
HeatWillRepeat::and youre right 2012 will be title number THREE! So EAT IT CLOWN!
HeatWillRepeat::Hey DUMMY! They WON the SECOND title during the 2011 season! We are in the 2012 season NOW you ANNOYING little girl!
nba is the worst::Wow - like I said, learn to count.  Again (read slowly): 2005-2006 = 1ST YR (NBA title*) 2006-2007 = 2nd  2007-2008 = 3rd  2008-2009 = 4th  2009-2010 = 5th  2010-2011 = 6th  2011-2012 = 7th (NBA title*) <b>2012-2013 = this season  STILL FAIL!</b>

Zerrin74::Miami worst team in the league
HeatWillRepeat::Someone who complains about the refs so much is OBVIOUSLY a gambling degenerate LOSER!
HeatWillRepeat::who LOST ALOT of money!
nba is the worst::There are currently 24 teams worse than the heat, and 8 worse than the lakers
oneandonlybabe::Standing wise yes, but as you so often and conveniently point out, the schedule and the refs contribute to skew teams performance. The Lakers, considering their 'star power' are definitely one of the worst!
oneandonlybabe::Worse than the Lakers? If so, they're really bad!!! LOL
nhraven52::nba is the worst Heat will get swept in the 1st round just like the last time they tried to defend an asterisk title.  Didnt you just say the past is irrelevant??
nba is the worst::Just using heat fan logic.
oneandonlybabe::hehe... pretty much.
Treydey10::oneandonlybabe - Does that make you a Heat fan by association? Suit yourself, it's amusing. People should chill and don't get defensive by your posts though.  I agree, his post are pretty funny and predictable to me lol.When the Heat lose it's because they" didn't get any help from the the refs" and when they win," they got help from the refs".
nba is the worst::It hopefully makes a point about how silly predicting what a very different knicks team will do in this years playoffs because of past history is -  by posting an equally absurd statement about a past heat team.
oneandonlybabe::Does that make you a Heat fan by association? Suit yourself, it's amusing. People should chill and don't get defensive by your posts though.
oneandonlybabe::You don't get his 'logic' past, is only relevant when it's not favourable to the Heat.
HeatWillRepeat::You have to understand SHE is always WRONG!
HeatWillRepeat::Notice how nba is the worst continually posts the same posts over and over. I thought u are supposed to get banned for repeated posts?
HeatWillRepeat::thats right, Annoying clown that brings nothing new to the table. No wonder nobody likes you.

nhraven52::Miami is being smart and pacing themselves while the Knicks are trying to win the regular season.The Celtics are already worn down.There wont be much competition for Miami come playoff time.
nhraven52::We'll see if the Knicks can continue to hit 80% of their 3's over an entire season.
nba is the worst::?  knicks have been around 40% all season, .410 as of today
melo kidd tyson amare Felton::This is a big tough physical ny team that was put together to beat the heat failer is not a option

HeatWillRepeat::Heat WILL repeat too bad for you and ur Spurs who will be ELIMINATED before the finals!
nba is the worst::If the heat wanted to repeat they would have hired Phil Jackson.  Heat's poor defense and rebounding spells doom - a hungrier team will make the Finals this season
HeatWillRepeat::STILL the CHAMPIONS!

HeatWillRepeat::Heat are the Champions! Too Bad!

Melos Leg::Worst playoff winning percentage than anyone who has played 50+ games, good luck with that.
oneandonlybabe::It's not about this particular instance, it's how you use past relevance to suit your arguments. It's pretty funny as I've said.  Carry on.
nba is the worst::You disagree?  How does a different knicks' team's playoff winning percentage from previous seasons relate to this season?
oneandonlybabe::"Past is irrelevant"  LOL  There you go again... hilarious!
nba is the worst::That was in Boston, silly.   heat beat Boston in miami by 8
Melos Leg::yeah, Boston only beat them by 19....
nba is the worst::Past is irrelevant.  Knicks didn't beat the heat by 20 in Miami last season - in fact nobody did!

HeatWillRepeat::Isnt that against espn regulations?
Jking2311::Let me know when they actually win a playoff series.
nba is the worst::Wow - can't handle the truth, eh heat fans?  To summarize, Finals record ref job 97 fts gave the heat the '06 title
nba is the worst::You didn't watch?  Cuban had a huge feud with Stern that year. Finals was tied 2-2.  Game 5, Heat were given 49 fts to the Mavs 25, and "somehow" prevailed by 1 pt in OT. Gm 6 on the road, heat +14 to win by 3. Wade shot 47 fts in those 2 games, Mavs team 42. That was almost 3X his reg season AND playoff avg.  His 97 ftas is a Finals record in just 6 games (compare it to kobe's in 2010 seven-gm series, 59 fts)
Jking2311::nba is the worst - Heat will get swept in the 1st round just like the last time they tried to defend an asterisk title.  How is it an asterisk title? Did they not win the title?
nba is the worst::Heat will get swept in the 1st round just like the last time they tried to defend an asterisk title.
HeatWillRepeat::theyll be eliminated in the first round.
Melos Leg::The Wizards also beat Miami, would they win a 7 game series against them?  Grow a damn brain....
HeatWillRepeat::keep dreaming. When you actually WIN something open ur mouth.
nba is the worst::4 months until the playoffs.  Are you saying those weren't WINS?
Melos Leg::It was also the regular season, you are such a biased $@%!.  It is kind of funny.
nba is the worst::104-84 112-92  2-0
nhraven52::In the playoffs??
Melos Leg::The problem I have with the Knicks is that their team is VERY old and they rely so heavily on the 3 ball.  It's only a third of the way through a season and Knicks fans are already yelling that they won a title (I'd be yelling and bragging too if my team had only won 1 playoff game in 10 years).  But they are putting way too much NAS in the first half of the race.  By the last stretch of the season, they'll be burned out.
melo kidd tyson amare Felton::Amare and iman will change all that yhe Knicks are coming
Melos Leg::Iman is coming back from a torn ACL he isn't going to change anything, and Amare....well he'll just punch a fire extinguisher again
Mr. Nut Job::Boy!  That sure was funny!  When they lost to Washington!  Now they have come to show that they can beat them!
Jking2311::Yeah. Melo could tear something or someone else significant could get hurt. The Knicks still aren't gonna win the championship. Even if he stays healthy.
nba is the worst::It's a lot more likely that B. Wade will get hurt IMO
Jking2311::If the Knicks beat Miami in the playoffs, I will give them props. Until then, beating Miami in the regular season is irrelevant.
nba is the worst::NP - playoffs 4 months away, a lot can happen by then.
HeatWillRepeat::TOO BAD! CHAMPIONS!
HeatWillRepeat::its also funny that they ARE the CHAMPIONS! Get It?
nba is the worst::*
Mr. Nut Job::HeatWillRepeat - its also funny that they ARE the CHAMPIONS! Get It?  So... why should that matter since we aren't talking about that subject?
nhraven52::And they won.
Melos Leg::5K+ comments when they lose, 1632 when they win.  Pretty funny.
nhraven52::Finally Miami plays some defense.Nice work.
Jking2311::Who honestly thinks that Miami will still play crappy in the playoffs? The Knicks, however, will choke and get put out by Miami if they are even lucky enough to make it to the conference finals.
Jking2311::Well
Jking2311::I mean two years ago they couldn't seem to beat the bulls or the celtics in the regular season but look at the playoffs that year. And yes I know that they lost to Dallas that year but oh we'll.
nhraven52::Each game IS important, but they cant win every game.
Mr. Nut Job::Yes, but it's nice when they really want to.  I fear that the MONEY is what they are thinking about, mostly.  What do you think these 'heroes' think and do everyday... The Game is bigger than they are or the Owners for that matter... it's a shame that greed will win out amongst them.  Alas that is the History of it all...
HeatWillRepeat::Just the troll nba is the worst who is ALWAYS wrong in her predictions!
nba is the worst::Hmmm - in 2011 I wasn't
nhraven52::Championship teams know that the playoffs are what really matters.Win enough games in the regular season, then turn it on when it matters.Nobody thought Miami would go undefeated this or any other season.Only the haters expected them to, ironically enough.
Melos Leg::Not in the NBA Mr. Nut job
Mr. Nut Job::nhraven52 - Championship teams know that the playoffs are what really matters.Win enough games in the regular season, then turn it on when it matters.Nobody thought Miami would go undefeated this or any other season.Only the haters expected them to, ironically enough.  That's a poor way to think.  Each game is important, no matter what it is for.
How many KoBRICKS does it take to build the Staples Center::how do you know youre the best player in the NBA? start off going 1-5 and 2-7 at half time to finish 8-15 for the game.  <b> LeBestInTheWorld.</b>
nba is the worst::Heat took 27 threes - way to "attack the rim"
Mr. Nut Job::Nothing new... they are shooting 3's more on every team... it will turn against them when the odds bring them down as will always occur.
nba is the worst::What's funny about this is that in the 2 wins over the heat, those threes could all have been 2s and the knicks still win both games.  The knicks rely on low turnovers, ball movement, and not doubling lebron so they can guard the perimeter.  That's how you beat the heat.
nhraven52::The Knicks rely 100% on 3's, thats not gonna last.
HeatWillRepeat::Thats why the Knicks dont stand a chance in the playoffs!
HeatWillRepeat::Heat will Win the title again Easy! No Problem!
nba is the worst::Sure - teams repeat all the time - like the heat in '07!!!  Oh wait...
nhraven52::Go criticize another team.
Melos Leg::They won by 30, who cares
How many KoBRICKS does it take to build the Staples Center::oh ok. thanks.
TheAvenger007::The reason Miami Heat don't match well with Knicks is because of turnovers. Miami live off of turnovers. Their fast paced, up the court game is the best when it comes to turnovers. The knicks allow the fewest turnovers in the league. Teams need to start playing smarter against miami and they won't have a tough time.
Jking2311::Hahahahaha. You are pretty Fucking dumb if you believe that!
Jking2311::The heat are a different beast in the playoffs. The Knicks will not make it past them in a seven game series.
nba is the worst::They won't have to - heat will lose to the 7 seed.
FloridaGatorsForever::The Knicks will get owned in the Playoffs.
How many KoBRICKS does it take to build the Staples Center::nba is the worst keeps bandwagoning teams.. calm down and choose one.
nba is the worst::Is making the finals getting "owned"?  ;)

Antsea91::Lebeast balling! Too bad wheelchair wade and all his bandwagon fanboys are still around. Gonna be hilarious when they ship crymeariver wade out. Bron don't need that fool

gsquared112::So I guess this justifies LeBrick's career. 30-point win over the worst team in the league. Heat are back now. What an amazing regular-season performance from the King

Ray Allen GOAT 3 2.0::Much respect for Lebron James to bring his kids to the game. I hope that this never happens again to anyones children.

AlexMia305::Lmao okay, lucky for you the east sucks and you won't have to play the heat in the 1st round this year. Keep thinking these regular season wins mean something you guys are still garbage
atom_UP::Be real, Knicks aren't garbage. Give credit where credit is due. Plus, regular season games do matter since they determine home court advantage come playoff time, not to mention getting favorable match ups in the playoffs.
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::How did this team ever lose to Washington in the first place?  They've been sleepwalking through most of this season, that's for sure.  Hopefully this is a sign of their awakening.
