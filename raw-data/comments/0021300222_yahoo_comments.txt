Jude::Wall and Nene have been great so far.  Gortat was an amazing pickup that is mixing in well even though he got acquired at the last minute.  Besides Beal, I have been most impressed with Martell Webster's constant scoring.  Ariza is a good shooter as well.  I hope this team reaches another level when Beal and Otto Porter will be in the lineup within couple of weeks.  Even Vessley is a punch off the bench that can be an even greater asset by playoff time.  Please?  Finally?
andrew::Save our bucks!!  This team needs a rebuild, starting with this season.  Play the youth, see what they can do, and maximize draft picks for our veterans.
Marlowe::to the bucks coach: Play john henson at least 30 to 35 mpg, You're so concerned about having boost off the bench but your starting 5 can't compete, it's not like henson will be too tired late in the 4th quarter, you're not gonna get to the playoffs anyway, play henson play henson play henson
Anton::This Wizards team is actually really good. I think they will make some noise in the playoffs with John Wall growing into their leader.
Amir::Nice job Wiz i love you, Starting five to compete against any NBA team , When Beal is back and Ariza as 6TH man we are set to not throw the games with 2nd unit , expected easy 15+ but oh well, again not regretting watch Wiz at 4-5 AM from Europe. Greetings
Bob S::This team may not win another game this season and I'm a Bucks fan.
Ryan::John Henson could be another Pau Gasol if given the opportunity.. Is coach Drew an idiot?
Gift::Henson needs to play the whole 4th just to get to 25 mins. What the hell is wrong with the Bucks!? Isn't it obvious that you're not going to win this season? Why not try to let the young guys figure out how to win?
Steven N.::Brandon Knight sucks #$%$
PKM::It would be really sad if Stern doesn't give the Bucks a top 2 pick but he won't.
