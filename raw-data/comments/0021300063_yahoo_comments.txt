bald eagle::Well that's it, Philly is slowly sliding back to their usual place in the standings.
elijah::Good game WIZ!. However, I am still trying to find which genius let AJ Price leave as Wall's back up for Maynor. He is not good at all, we need a better PG......
C.Jin::Carter-Williams seems to be coming back down to earth. The last two games hes just chucking shots and making less than half of them.
chuck d::nice Yahoo  no NBA box scores tonight; you gotta love it
chuck d::nice job Yahoo nerds, no box scores; go to CBS
David::Is it me, or does Yahoo keep making changes for the worse? Where are the box scores.
fup duck::Spencer Hawes is shocking the world
emb001981::30 points and 21 rebounds for Nikola Vucevic against the Clippers. Yikes! That trade continues to look worse and worse. That guy is still only 23 years old. Sixers had a player and Doug Collins buried him and then they traded him to get a guy that never played a single game for the franchise.
nddreams::Man I wish there was more detail on the game.  What's up with the news?
BossMan::one down...  11 to go...
