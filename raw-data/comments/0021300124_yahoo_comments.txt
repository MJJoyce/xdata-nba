Seattle Blows!::what 'kept the warriors in game' was their points off OKC's turnovers. they really need to pound the boards on both ends, mainly defensive boards as OKC had a ton of second chance points. I love Lee, Bogut and Iggy, but pound the boards! go Warriors!
Rodney::The Warriors got this.
Justin::To those who called ME an idiot, I still stand by what I previously stated; until OKC gets a 3rd scoring option (Ibaka is NOT the 3rd option), OKC will AGAIN lose in the 1st round of the play-offs.
Boofington::That was the first time I had heard an interview with Igoudala. What an intelligent, humble, and classy guy.
kahlua::right now this OKC roster is not good enough to win a title... they need a third scorer and bit of a more serious front court... they should see if they can get Pau Gasol and if not see what they can get for Ibaka as he is their only realistic trade chip
dster20::Lee missed three he normally makes which would have made this a lot harder for OKC to come back.
Commenter::Looking at the stats it appears OK city might have gotten robbed of a game. The stat that stands out against Ok city is the 3 point shots  Golden state shot 14 compared to Ok city's 8 and that appears to turn the game.  Ok city out rebounded Golden state 55-39 and that could have been the difference for Ok city but it was not??
Kobe For 3.....Clank!::What a finish!
Princess Luna::Good evening, NBA fans! I hope every one of you is watching and enjoying this marvelous game tonight!
travisf::Holy #$%$, what a game
