Cjustice007::WOW this board is slooooooow!!!
Shane_Partridge::An analyst on ESPN said this morning that no team besides the Bulls could upset the Heat in the playoffs... psscchtt. I don't think he thought about the freakin' FOUR-SEED that EMBARRASSED them THREE TIMES IN A ROW. Celtics will be &gt; Heat in the playoffs.
dabears10540::geeze miami.... your bench is f'ing awesome!
ThatsGoodSoup7963::I don't mean to live in the past, but do you remember when the Celtics were 22-4 when Shaq could play 22+ minutes a game?
jdzspace.::ok, so we need the Magic to beat the Bobcats (easy enough) and/or the Knicks to lose to the Clipps, and the Sixers to beat the Bucks (who knows on that one)
Dem_Canes_Man::I see that the board has died....
Dem_Canes_Man::let me go and check it out.
Bede Bears::Bulls board is kickin'
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Pacers
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::with over inflated egos
jdzspace.::who are the bulls playing?
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Have you been to the Bulls' board today?
Dem_Canes_Man::nah...just getting back online.
Dem_Canes_Man::your post is ridiculous, but your username is funny! Can't lie!
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Have a good one guys. I think I am going to see what Bulls fans are up to on their board.
jdzspace.::C's!!
jdzspace.::ok, i'm finally getting the chance to watch this game.   hope the C's can pull it out
Whitesoxfan5588::oh yeah thanks for the help C's .......can't wait to play you guys in the ECF ........Celts vs Bulls Part 2 :P
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::No such luck there. It's going to be the second round.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Real talk: What are the C's chances if Ray does not return?
Shaun0088::Good chance..Bradley is shooting pretty well and can cut to the basket plus has some of the best defense in the NBA.All Ray does is shoot jumpshots at this point in his career which is good but like I say about Rondo (There is more to basketball then shooting jumpshots) and doesn't play much defense.
Soxwin91::same as their chances if Ray does return.
jdzspace.::rose can bob a knob
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Rose has looked great lately...
jdzspace.::no, if Ray comes back we have a great chance to go deep if not all the way
jdzspace.::zero
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::That's what I'm thinking...:(

UK_Basketball_for_Life2::Corey Maggette?

UK_Basketball_for_Life2::Did Rondo go to a terrible college?
Celtics1634::YES

Celtics1634::Jamal Mashburn went to a terrible college
Celtics1634::Sam Bowie went to a terrible college
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::Is this the Rock?
JB_Smoove_bruh_man::All I know is, on paper, knicks are much better than the Heat. Doesnt that mean anything? lol
nba is the worst::Too injured.  Davis hurt, Amare hurt, Lin out
34BigDaddyO::No, that's why they play the games. :)
JB_Smoove_bruh_man::Ohh snap, you right bruh man
JB_Smoove_bruh_man::Whatever his name is, he should have been coaching the knicks from ths start. Why work under D'Antoni? Maybe he knew he'd lose his job at some point..we all did.
954_2_da_305::Mike Woodson or Woodsen however you spell it.
954_2_da_305::Mike Brown= coach of the lakers.
jdzspace.::Mike Brown is a coach? all these years i thought he was like the inflattable flailing arm things you see at car dealerships
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::To be fair, D'Antoni never wanted Carmelo and was doing fine with his core of players.
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::I don't think their D can ever match up with the Bulls or Heat. I still think Amare has something to give. I think he's better than Bosh.
34BigDaddyO::Amare is as soft as toilet paper haha. He isn't the same player without Nash. Kind of like how Malone wasn't the same without Stockton. I think it's going to be their new found defense, if you want to call it that. If they play D, they have a chance. If not, it won't be close.
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::I get that Melo is impressive but I think Amare will be the key if they want any chance at those teams.
34BigDaddyO::Yup, and the current team could too, but I don't see it them beating Heat or Bulls. Even though it would go six games I think.
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::That team would have been tough in the playoffs.
34BigDaddyO::Good point, that was a real "team".
PP owns Rondo::JD and Nba  Do you 2 think that Miami or Chicago has a clear and decisive advantage over the Knicks? I just don't see it. IMO, if a team has the better frontcourt, they usually win the series. NY has a better frontcourt than Miami or Chicago. What am I missing here.  Tyson, Amare, Melo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Noah, Boozer, Deng &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (Joel, U-Dub, Ronnie), Bosh, Lebron
jdzspace.::the Heat don't have a real advantage outside of the 3 stars. . . . and Melo and Chandler nuetralize most of them.   the Bulls have a better bench, better rebounding and a better coach.
jdzspace.::yeah, smart money is on Miami.   but the smart money was on the Spurs last year in the first round too. . . . sometimes you just never know
jdzspace.::Atlanta is an enigma.   they embarass themselves against the Celtics 3rd string. . . . and then beat the Clippers.   not sure what to make of them
Aicyla22::okay i guess we shall see who the better team is then, i know who i got my $$ on though :)
34BigDaddyO::Philly or Atlanta don't have a shot either. :)
jdzspace.::it's hard to say they are a far superior team because like you said, they have handled the Knicks fairly recently and the knicks were at full strength (so to speak).   but things are different in the playoffs, more time to dial in and prepare, better gameplans, so we will see.
Aicyla22::of course every team (besides orlando) has a shot, but your initial post indicated that the knicks are better, but you're smart i see you kind of don't want to give a direct answer. I just don't see how a better team can get beat by a lesser team so to speak if one team has more pure talent wouldn't that make them the better team?  You do give clearly convoluted reasons rondos a bum haha
jdzspace.::as a basketball TEAM. yes they are better. or at the least have better pieces
954_2_da_305::The Miami stars are more talented, but knicks have more players with talent is what you mean.
PP owns Rondo::LOL, you're still my girl. I've also give you clear reasons of why I think NY is better.
jdzspace.::I don't know if i would say the Knicks are "better"  the Heat are a better defensive team. credit where it is due. and while they only have 3.5 good players. those 3.5 good players are better than any 5-6 players on the Knicks combined.   yes, the Knicks have a better overall team. . .  .and the Heat could beat them on pure talent (and probably will), but the Kicks have a shot
Aicyla22::i didn't ask if in a 7 game series it could happen. I asked are the knicks (in you're opinion) better than the heat?
Aicyla22::rondos a bum, i know your mindset is convoluted, i was asking jd
jdzspace.::they do have more talented players, more depth and a better coach. ... .so. . . in a 7 game series.   it could happen
PP owns Rondo::Yes
Aicyla22::so pretty much you're saying the knicks are better than the heat?
Celtics1634::Chicago plays much better defense and they're a better team.  The Knicks are selfish players
nba is the worst::They've been hurt all year - not gonna change by this weekend
PP owns Rondo::I agree with the defense part but not the selfish part. You also didn't answer the Heat part of the question.
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::I think they could beat the Bulls but not Miami
jdzspace.::thibs&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;woodson
Celtics1634::Sure, but that doesn't mean they're on the same level as Chicago or Miami
JB_Smoove_bruh_man::They have improved since the coaching change.
34BigDaddyO::That was one hell of a WNBA game last night between both benches. Feel bad for my friend who paid for a ticket to see that mess.
JB_Smoove_bruh_man::Go Celtics!
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::Too funny!
nba is the worst::Possible statuatory rape, depending on the age of consent, and depending on local laws, could be "contributing to the delinquency of a minor"

UK_Basketball_for_Life2::LMAO
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Do you think that KG and/or Ray will coming back to Boston next year?
PP owns Rondo::KG - yes  Ray - leaning towards no.
ThatsGoodSoup7963::I think there is a small chance that KG will resign, but I have to agree with you on Ray. I really don't want to see him go...especially to L.A.
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::No, Chalmers and make LBJ the ball handler. SMH
nba is the worst::He's going to start over B. Wade?  Smh
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::And the Heat will jump in and take him.
jdzspace.::he said in a recent interview that he can still play 40mpg. so he won't go to LA to come off the bench. he would want to start.
ThatsGoodSoup7963::I was talking about the Lakers, but I didn't even consider the Clippers...that wouldn't be as bad, I suppose.
jdzspace.::he wouldn't go to LA, he doesn't want to come off the bench. . . . . unless you mean the Clippers. in that case, yeah. that could happen.
jdzspace.::no. . . . . and it saddens me to say that.
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::I think Ray is done in Boston. Not sure about KG. Depends what he's willing to accept in salary.
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Damn, dude.
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::Too sad to think about...
jdzspace.::I think it's over. . . . . the big 3 era, is done. and it will NOT end with them riding off into the sunset together. it will not end with 34, 5 and 20 being raised to the rafters of the Garden.   it will end with the final buzzer of the 4th quarter of the Celtics last playoff game this year. without ceremony, without fanfare. .it just. . . .ends
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::I still think KG might come back (maybe wishful thinking)
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::Good point!
jdzspace.::so much for "Boston is a brotherhood"
jdzspace.::forget the C's without Ray and KG. . . . . think about the C's going AGAINST KG and/or Ray... . . . the idea is almost heartbreaking
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::Yeah. It is going to be hard to see the C's without those guys. Especially KG for me; the heart of the team.
jdzspace.::I hate Danny so much for making it soo easy for Ray and KG to walk away from Boston after this year.
PP owns Rondo::Why do Miami fans down the Knicks so much when they basically have equal talent?
jdzspace.::I didn't even realize that the Knicks could drop to 8th. i was paying more attention to them not moving up to 6th
nba is the worst::@Bucks, @ Pistons.  They're 0-4 vs the heatles, but have beaten Chi - what do you think they will do?
jdzspace.::the Magic still need to beat the Bobcats to secure their spot.   who is Philly playing next?
UK_Basketball_for_Life2::Philly's won 3 straight.
nba is the worst::It would take Philly winning - not happening.
idontsweatyou::Are you high?
ChicagRose::you just answered your own question
nba is the worst::head to head:  Gm 1 (no Pierce) , 2nd game of the reg season, heatles +10 rebs Gm 2 Boston +2 reb Gm 3 Boston +6 reb
jdzspace.::good times
nba is the worst::Hope the C's get past the bulls - they will destroy the heatles!
JB_Smoove_bruh_man::Finally, some facts.
idontsweatyou::Boston is so screwed.  Heat fans
PP owns Rondo::If the Knicks drop down to 8, Chicago will be in trouble. They would have to play NY in the 1st round. If they win they get Boston in the 2nd round which I think ny C's will win. I actually think NY will beat either Chicago or Miami in the 1st round.
ChicagRose::melo cant save you every game...
idontsweatyou::What do u base this on , other than your own opinion?
dslick34::Bulls in 5 over the Knicks, and the Bulls in 6 over the C's.
Dem_Canes_Man::If DWill was at the 1 for NY, then you would have to be concerned.   Heat in 5.
idontsweatyou::Miami averages 3 rebounds more per game than Boston, no big deal
Dem_Canes_Man::yes it is...possessions count in the 2nd season. There are no do overs!
nba is the worst::See above - Celtics outrebounded the heatles 2 out of 3 games (excluding the benchfest last night)
idontsweatyou::Ok
Dem_Canes_Man::once again...in the 2nd season, it matters. Games are closer kid.
idontsweatyou::Not that big of a deal
Dem_Canes_Man::ummm...okay?!?
idontsweatyou::Dude its 3 rebounds lol
htimsr40::Best D-League game of the night.
Dem_Canes_Man::The only real tough match up for the Heat are the Lakers (if the Kobe System doesn't take over). They have skilled bigs, a wing who can score, and 1 who can get into the lane. Memphis intrigues me too, but they're not ready. OKC turns it over too much, and Russ at the 1 plays right into the Heat's plan.
brandonlee561heat22::totally agree, the only real dominant big man in the east is done
Dem_Canes_Man::Yeah.
