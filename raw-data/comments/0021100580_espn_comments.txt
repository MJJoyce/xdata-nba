01rockett02::Trade Thornton for a decent forward. Start IT, Jimmer, Evans and Cousins
E. Jack Culate::Can someone teach keith smart how to jimmer?
dcreery15::wat ppl don't get about knicks is that the problem is ther defense, lin shump walker jeffries and chandler is way better then lin fields carmelo stat and  chandler  more on that here http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
david508540::Hassan Whiteside is going to be better than Cousins. Fact.
tdawg44446::Pure stupidity. Cousins is going to be the best center in the NBA, by the way he's playing.
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::Well I'm out, gn all. GG Hornets, exciting win to get. Gn and later all, GO KINGS!
Isaiah v2::isaiah is beast
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::anybody else here?
williamebonybrick::IT can definitely be the go to defensive stopper in tight games he did pretty well against the likes of Kobe,Wall,Wade etc  Let's see Smart let IT and Jimmer play a full game and see what happens?  What have they got to lose? They are not making the playoffs this year.
BYUsGotHeart::who would be the point? the one that runs around looking for "his" or the one that makes the right play w/ his bball IQ? props to IT for his athleticism, but it's not helping the flow of the offense. the other team can sag off of him, while they pick up Jimmer at half court and stick on him, opening up everyone else's game. Smart thinks he's developing Fredette. He's not.
BLazEdTrailerz::The current starting PG w/ the better handles/court-vision/speed/defense/etc... would run point.
mrfoof4::well keith smart has something to lose. he's gotta play to win games to keep his job. not to mention they'd get burned on defense even worse than they do now.
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::not a full game, but let them start together and get 30-35min each.
arsenal1470::What did Cousins eat coz the boxscore says DNP - Food Poisoning?
Isaiah v2::he sent some chick a dick pic
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::he got shot while driving over a hippy and eating a steak. REALLY confusing I know
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::KINGS WWWWWWWWWWWWIN
Mole1932::LOL........
Mole1932::Evens would score more.....if two persons would give him the ball more......
Mole1932::Thanks that made my day.....
BLazEdTrailerz::Evans would score more if he could remember which hole to put it in....
BLazEdTrailerz::Lol. for some reason. This makes me think of the Dave Chapelle skit where Prince is balling on Charlie Murphy.
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::at least he doesn't put it in the opponents hole
TyrekeTheKing13::well missed a great game but glad to see the jimmer did well. lets keep our home record up
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::yeah
TyrekeTheKing13::obviously he has nothing better to do
BLazEdTrailerz::That is.... until LockerSeahawker came in
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::I think it was fine, there were some trolls but since Jimmer got a lot of time the jockeys didn't go crazy.
BLazEdTrailerz::Aren't they always?
TyrekeTheKing13::was it a good board today?
Mole1932::Watch out GS .....Sac right behind you......
YodaSucks::I am out. Good win tonight guys. Both IT and Jimmer did well, hopefully this helps to quell the anti-Jimmer and anti-IT camps.
d.mccue83::why cause Jimmer Fredette scored 11 pts vs the NO Hornets? lets throw him a parade?  anybody in? lol whats wrong with sports these days.
Astro_Dawg::No, it's the rookie version LBJ vs MJ get used to it.
lockerseahawker::terrible comparison
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::gn
BLazEdTrailerz::IT&gt;Jimmer UW&gt;BYU Locker&gt;Jake Heaps Santorum&gt;Romney  Eat it you peace-loving hippy! xP
BLazEdTrailerz::Somebody fell into the Sar-'chasm"
lockerseahawker::Santorum is stupid as hell
Astro_Dawg::IT wins a game on defense.  Somewhere (Seattle) Coach Romar is shedding a tear into a pint of Chunky Monkey!
BLazEdTrailerz::LoRo better put the Chunky Monkey down and start game planning for the Beavers tomorrow.
lockerseahawker::Shafedogg26 with a terrific insult people!  "don't be stupid, locker....try hooked on fonics...it may work for u"  Oh, the irony.
shafedogg26::it would be, "his" life but thanks for showing me a grammatical error...numb nutz
shafedogg26::are u smoking something...your comebacks are horrible
lockerseahawker::Look at yourself, kid. Can you honestly say that you'll get a job to support yourself. I'm trying to help you. Someone who cannot spell "phonics" needs to reevaluate their life.
shafedogg26::I am scared...I am shaking in my boots....don't hurt me!
lockerseahawker::Can you afford boots? I predict you won't be able to afford proper footwear without a proper education.
lockerseahawker::Oh, man. I'm coming for shafedogg next game.
YodaSucks::LET the man leave. No more comments!
shafedogg26::go study your addition and subtraction
shafedogg26::good come back buddy.....you are a super star up there aren't you?
lockerseahawker::Apparently you need to. You can't spell "phonics" correctly. Perhaps you should try earning your GED? Minimum wage really can't support you and your inbred family.
lockerseahawker::I did, but shafe added some input as I was leaving.
YodaSucks::Didnt you say you were leaving?
Astro_Dawg::yeah, that's purdy gud
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::IT was a boss at the end
BLazEdTrailerz::57seconds of playing time in the 4th qrtr. But that was all he needed I guess....
Astro_Dawg::Hornets not quite there yet.  They should trade up for a #60 pick next year :)
CDH11153::Well it was a good team win ...thats right TEAM...win. Gotta run....
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::gn KINGS WIN
Astro_Dawg::"If you want the ball, you'll have to pry it out of my cold, dead fingers!" - Marcus Thornton
lockerseahawker::You can blame Mormon Ball for my trolling.   See you guys next game.
shafedogg26::I am not a BYU fan, but thanks for playing
lockerseahawker::I'm sure you're "Hooked on Phonics!"
shafedogg26::haha that was a good one....did they teach u that at UW?  You suck!
lockerseahawker::Conference champs? Sorry, I wouldn't want to take money from the mentally deficient.
shafedogg26::go watch your huskies make the NIT
lockerseahawker::I was done trolling, but man, he trolled himself.
YodaSucks::haha this is the first thing i have liked that locker has said all night, but he is still rather annoying.
BLazEdTrailerz::omg. that was pretty funny.....
lockerseahawker::phonics?   You, sir, are a dumb$@%.  QUOTE OF THE DAY PEOPLE: "don't be stupid, locker....try hooked on fonics...it may work for u"
shafedogg26::don't be stupid, locker....try hooked on fonics...it may work for u
YodaSucks::Anyone but BSU
YodaSucks::he said the huskies make it to the NIT i fail to see how that makes him a BYU fan.
BLazEdTrailerz::Just curious Yoda, what College team do you root for?
lockerseahawker::Replying to some trolling by shafe. BYU got blown out by the 2nd best team in Washington.
shafedogg26::I don't want to take your allowance from you....but yeah let's beat......$2292928477347...loser
YodaSucks::why does everyone assume if you dont like locker you are a byu fan.... I say fu-ck that noise
YodaSucks::Jesus christ i thought you were gone!
UWashington253::whoa whoa whoa... Is BYU on the NIT bubble this year?
lockerseahawker::Want to put money on them making the tournament?
UWashington253::I got balled up at a mormon league the other day. True story. Broke a pair ankles though, so im happy.
YodaSucks::please no....
HowardSternsTinyDong::Dumb $@%.s on her praising the Kings when you were basically handed the game at the end by the worst team in the league.
BLazEdTrailerz::Kings Win!!
HowardSternsTinyDong::Thanks to the monkey Ariza yes you do win
Astro_Dawg::Thornton has 58 assists in 1095 minutes played.  Horrible. Jimmer has 64 in 669 minutes.
stephenson1mattbyu::You are just going off of what people said of Jimmer going into the draft d.mccue. They said he couldn't pass well and couldn't play defense at all. He actually has showed that his passing is one of the best parts of his game and his defense has actually been average NBA defense and at times good. Also he hasn't played point guard all the minutes he has been in. Many times IT,Salmons and Evans have shared time at point when they have been jn the game at the same time; but you wouldn't know that sense you haven't watched the games and just go off of what his critics have said.
d.mccue83::now the funny part. Thornton is a SHOOTING guard...was drafted as a shooting guard, and always has been a shooting guard. yet Jimmer was drafted as a PG..so 64 assists in 669 Mins as a PG is a frigin joke..but you already know that since you're so smart. here's what i think is horrible..Jimmer's 38% shooting..or his .6 steals. or his ZERO defensive ability.. Thornton is the teams SHOOTING guard..his job like all the other Shooting guards in the league, is to score..which he does..and he does it well. 18.6 pts per game. less than 2 TO's per game..86% from the line..1.6 Steals per game..so unlike alot of other SG in the league, he can play defense..yet you're bashing him, because Jimmer has a slightly better assist rate from the PG position? you sir are a class A moron.
UWashington253::There is only one certainty  in this world today. Demarcus Cousins and Thorton will not pass the ball back.
CDH11153::DMC is a beast..... just wish he would pass it more....play a inside out kinda game .
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::DMC will, not Thornton
BLazEdTrailerz::Here's a thought!! Stop responding to the trolls and they might get bored and go away?
sykog::But I like to laugh
sklater::Sorry.  Will you forgive me?
BLazEdTrailerz::Did the Kings Win?? =P
CDH11153::POSTS OF THE NIGHT RIGHT HERE!!!!!!!!!  UWashington253 Jimmer and Isaiah Thomas arnt even comparable IMO. Totally differnt players and honestly I think they are going to be a nasty duo in the future when all the ballhogging $@%!$@%!$ get traded. neilchr Both IT and Fredette helped win this game is the point. They play well together. Salmons also pulled his head out long enough to play a heck of a team game.
lockerseahawker::At UW, Mormons stand outside the library and try to convert passersby. We call it Mormon-dodging.
shafedogg26::another lame comment by Locker
lockerseahawker::It's kinda pathetic. They ask people for time to talk about Jesus Christ. It's an inconvenience really.
sklater::It's what you get for living in the U.S.
JBurhenn253::Locker- from a fellow diehard UW fan stop being a dick.
YodaSucks::Why dont you go troll on ldschat.org? That seems like it would be a better demographic
BLazEdTrailerz::Kings Win!!
sklater::Mormons don't convert anybody.
oromedlav::yes they do want to convert everybody.
YodaSucks::Hey cut him some slack, he is trying really hard
sklater::And I get a kick out of his responses.  It's kinda fun.
BLazEdTrailerz::Stop responding to dude. Obviously he gets a kick out of fanning the Jimmer vs. IT debate....
UWashington253::Jimmer and Isaiah Thomas arnt even comparable IMO. Totally differnt players and honestly I think they are going to be a nasty duo in the future when all the ballhogging $@%!$@%!$ get traded.
CDH11153::Ya they could be very good if they played as a TEAM!!!!!
UWashington253::I just can't stand the one on one sh it they run. I can coach this team.
CDH11153::Your hit the nail on the head they are totally different styles of players...but I think they can compliment each other very well......
itsatrap123::Bless you!
Astro_Dawg::yeah IT at the point, Jimmer at the 2.  It's what's worked best with Salmons as pseudo PG off the bench.
Astro_Dawg::IT didn't win starter over Jimmer, he won it over Salmons.
lockerseahawker::Mormons. Scientologists. Same deal.
YodaSucks::You can only like mormon athletes if you are mormon apparently. Dam-n i cant like Jimmer anymore
sklater::That's the best you got?  Come one now, try a little harder.  You want me to give you some material?  You got polygamy, utah, missionaries, virgins, etc.
BLazEdTrailerz::Kings Win!!
itsatrap123::Where is TyrekeisKing13? He missed an exciting one.
TyrekeTheKing13::i did but looked like you guys had fun
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::don't know
sklater::Locker's parents kicked her off.
lockerseahawker::Intelligent insult.
shafedogg26::like your jimmer insults are intelligent?  you are a little girl
YodaSucks::^like that?
sklater::uh?  Oh, I see.  It has 4 likes.  Are you saying I liked myself 4 times?
lockerseahawker::I liked how you like your own comment immediately after posting.
sklater::Damnit, she's got an iPhone.
UWashington253::Coach "not so" Smart  Stop leaving your bench in to end the game your not Gregg Poppabitch!
CDH11153::I think there are a few guys on the bench who should get 15 or so minutes each game
CDH11153::I thought the bench played well tonight and against denver. I wish he would figure a rotation out and stick to it for a week or 2
UWashington253::its not a jimmer thing. I would of preferred Jimmer in the game, he was playing great. Smart just needs to figure out a consistent roatation to end the game. You have to have most of your starters to end the game in order to build experience down the stretch.
YodaSucks::See IT fans can be Jimmer fans. I wish i couldve seen more of IT play in college, he was always exciting.
BLazEdTrailerz::Truth. Only reason we aren't crucifying him again is they pulled out the win at the end.
sklater::But they won the game.
Mole1932::Hey the beat the last  place team in the western league....very good for the kings....maybe they can stay in sac. for now....
Mole1932::yea.....but i troll back wards.....
YodaSucks::got rid of one troll, and now another...dam
sklater::Anyone watching the post game interview with Smart?
JohnnyPrettyman::He knows how to develop for sure. Benches any rookie when they're doing good....
BLazEdTrailerz::Kings Win!!
Astro_Dawg::said he wanted IT out for a bigger guard.  Jaret goes 11-17 for 25 points, how'd that work out for ya?
Astro_Dawg::exactly
BLazEdTrailerz::J. Jack was ballin tonight. None of the guards could stop him.
warb8::"I credit the win to my brilliant defensive call"
BLazEdTrailerz::rofl
BLazEdTrailerz::Who cares what he says. He's racist remember? =P
BLazEdTrailerz::Kings Win!!
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::kings win
YodaSucks::haha
sklater::Not being negative.  Just can tell he gets annoyed of all the questions about him when he's trying to develop an entire team.
sklater::Well yes.  Some reporter asked him about Jimmer and he's like "stop bugging me about Jimmer.  He's coming into his own, but let me develop him, etc., etc. etc."
BLazEdTrailerz::Kings Win!! Kings Win!! Kings Win!! Kings Win!!
neilchr::I don't understand this.  I expected to come here and see Sacramento fans enjoying a team victory.  Instead it's the same Jimmer vs IT crap as before.  Really getting old at this point.
neilchr::Both IT and Fredette helped win this game is the point.  They play well together.  Salmons also pulled his head out long enough to play a heck of a team game.
neilchr::I think what's going to happen is that long term the Kings will not be able to keep Thornton and Evans so we're probably looking at an IT/Jimmer backcourt with either Evans or Thornton in a couple of years.  Nice way to open the new arena most likely.  If they do keep both Evans and Thornton long term both IT and Fredette probably won't work but for now it's just nice to FINALLY get back in the win column.
sykog::It's LeBron's fault
BLazEdTrailerz::Damn you LeBron!!
YodaSucks::No it is Locker saying Jimmer sucks and people defending him. Why does everyone thing you can only like one? I like both, have since they were ballin in college. The seahawk troll is just trying to $@%! everyone off and has been talking shi-t about Jimmer all night. No one is saying It sucks or anything like that, they both did well tonight. Some just can't get off jimmers back....Locker.
YodaSucks::you are right the Kings did win!!
itsatrap123::IT was fun to watch last year in the Pac 10 tourney final. I picked them to go somewhat far but he's done great this year.
BLazEdTrailerz::Give it up Yoda..... Kings Win!!
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::tell me about it
itsatrap123::They were. And then some troll came on here insulting Fredette.
itsatrap123::All that matters. Doesn't matter who makes the play.
BLazEdTrailerz::Kings Win!! Kings Win!!
BLazEdTrailerz::Kings win!!!
BLazEdTrailerz::Locker, shut up. Stop trolling dude.
BLazEdTrailerz::Kings Win!!
oromedlav::IT?
HappyHappyJoyJoy0000::locker you are a terrible troll, shut up
lockerseahawker::How can Jimmer work things out? Is he gonna come back with better athleticism?  He should just try out for the Twilight series
chadwi12::that twilight comment was a little funny... that is saw jimmer sparkle twice tonight he's so white...
markbw1989::Jimmer did better than most of the point guards in the NBA combine and benched way more than all of them.  He came in 3rd on agility to Kemba Walker and Irving...
YodaSucks::Don't worry it is ok to be jealous of Jimmer. Not every white boy can ball.
lockerseahawker::No one is more pale than Jimmer
itsatrap123::He's probably darker than you haha
sklater::So, you hate him because he is white?
warb8::I went to WA a couple of weeks ago. Damn the girls are ugly there!!
sklater::Well, haven't you seen Locker's favorite movie?  Twilight.
sklater::Sparkling men excite him.
shafedogg26::IT plays defense like hellen keller
shafedogg26::shut up
BLazEdTrailerz::eh. not classy dude.
lockerseahawker::I came to troll Mormon ball, but I guess he wasn't here
sykog::Thats an honest guy right there
itsatrap123::Somebody's a little obsessed...
YodaSucks::haha did you just come to hate on Jimmer?
itsatrap123::This guy was probably the guy who was guarding him the night Jimmer got 52.
Mole1932::Thorton high game....but he like to hog the ball....he should pass when it gets locked up......
Astro_Dawg::yeah he's a black hole, no ball ever comes out of his hands unless to shoot
itsatrap123::Darn you Fredette! I predicted you would score 12 points but only got 11!
True StorieS::It took Fimmer 10 shots to score 1 less than Zeke. Why did Thomas get benched? He was on fire in the 1st half.
dahojas::Becaise:  Jimmer 5 assists 0 turn IT 2 and 2overs
JohnnyPrettyman::Coach is confusing..... When Jimmer does good he benches, and whe Isiah does good, he benches him. No wonder we suck so bad
neilchr::Did you actually watch the game?  Thomas was horrid and Fredette earned the PT.  That's why it's a TEAM.  Tough concept I know.  IT stayed in the game and won it in the end.....again a TEAM.  I'm not sure this Sacramento thing is going to work for me.  Think TEAM, TEAM, TEAM.  That doesn't mean YOUR GUY plays all the time.
Astro_Dawg::Jimmer played well, but also blew 3 lay-ups.
Astro_Dawg::Usually had Salmons run point anyway.  Jimmer usually comes in for Thornton
warb8::He scored but was sloppy.  2 TO and 2 quick fouls.
True StorieS::Oh, he definitely should have got some burn after the half though.
haberguy::50% shooting. I'll take it any night.
neilchr::Yes, but Fredette managed to stay on his feet.  Something that seemed tough for IT in the first half.
itsatrap123::And that's why Keith Smart is the coach...?
True StorieS::That's why you're not a coach. IT was 4-5...
Astro_Dawg::50% is excellent, but it's not 80%
Astro_Dawg::Coach "Smart" has rotations only he understands.  That or he just flips a coin during time outs
lockerseahawker::Don't worry, Jimmer will be lighting it up in five years... overseas
shafedogg26::I hope that you enjoy seeing your boy benched to Jimmer...it will be fun to see jimmer play more than IT
warb8::IT is a baller.   Never quits
hawkinsjosh::He has little man syndrome!
lockerseahawker::Jimmer can only hope to be as good as Kyle Korver.  He has no athletic upside. The dude can barely dunk at 6'3.
YodaSucks::it sounds like locker is the most hated man in the chat room. Poor guy. I am not saying Jimmer will be an all star or superstar but i think he can be better than Korver, he is a rookie he has plenty of time to work things out.
sykog::But he can Jimmer, so it's all good
neilchr::Yes, but yet he's making more money than you are isn't he.  Don't be a hater and live your own life.  It's a game dude.
sklater::Jimmer can hope to be as good as anyone.  You can only hope to be good enough to afford cable to watch these games.
itsatrap123::He can barely dunk? Oh no! Whatever shall we do!
sklater::Are you typing this in braile?
lockerseahawker::Yeah, he won't be able to defend anyone off the dribble with that pisspoor athleticism.
chadwi12::sykog how did u call that... is ur cable provider doctor emmit brown
sykog::I dont know who that is but I guess so?
hawkinsjosh::I'm happy Jimmer played but I don't get Coach Smart's rotations as all!  IT was having a great game (4-5 shooting, a few assists) and he only gets 16 minutes??  He has no rhyme or reason to his rotation at all.
CDH11153::Hey it worked tonight...... I just wish he was more consistent in his rotations...You have a whole roster no reason to not use the guys on it. I don't know if anyone should play more then 35 minutes a game unless they are on fire for the whole game. Instead of changing things every game settle in on a rotation and stick to it for 4 or 5 games
d.mccue83::he's the worst coach i've ever seen coach in my life..i'm literally left speechless after every Kings game..whoever the hottest scorer is for a particular game, you can bank he's the one that will sit for the entire 4th qtr for the usual rotation of Jimmer, Salmons, and Garcia...because thats a line-up that should be out on the floor in crunch time of an NBA game.
CDH11153::Ya I don't get it I think IT had 2 fouls early but he sat for a long time and he was on fire when he went out.....He should of came back sooner. Why can't they split minutes evenly. I just don't get it...
chadwi12::truth speaker... he's an idiot... benched fredette after ave 17 and shooting 60%from downtown... 2 dnp's .. and ur right, tonight, isiah played solid and got a lot of the jimmer treatment... play em both
sykog::Jimmer has been playing a little D lately
Psychrates::his torations were excellent.
