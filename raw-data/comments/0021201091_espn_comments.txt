Fomille::Why does Corbin not play Carroll? He is a great bench player that plays with intensity
fsdf4335::Go Jazz! Keep the lakers out!
I edit my comments after people call me names.::West &gt; East  Fact.
SWIFTSLICK::$@%!$@%! moron.   Fact.
cubuff2014::Burks &gt; Hayward, put that white boy on the bench
thebiglebongski::nets for the atlantic???? hahahahaha
O Zone Pro.::They Suck. lol.
JTM157::David Stern will be none too pleased if Utah makes the playoffs. He held numerous fundraisers for Barack Obama last summer to help him get reelected and beat Mormon Mitt Romney. The last thing he wants is to see the Jazz make it over the Lakers.
TheAvenger007::Brooooklyn.. We go Soft.  (Drum Roll)  We go soft.  Brooklyn we go soft, we go soft.
greenbean47::Nice game Utah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Michael28653::THANK YOU UTAH   DA BULLS
TIGRES1441::and please get rid of tommygun marcus thornton
TIGRES1441::fire keith smart
NASH_10::Utah beats "Brooklyn" ?? Really? lol
mikeisildur::Yep.  Lakers still lottery-bound
deymayor::Nets are not catching the Pacers or Knicks so land safely on the 6th or 7th spot and avoid the Heat in the 2nd round.
RNYC_125::Nets suck.
Dawan208::42-31 Knicks not much better at 45- 26.   Now the Heat are at 60 wins!!!!!!!
cheeze5317::Why have the jazz in the playoffs? They can't win anyways might as well let lakers get in more of intresting story to talk about if they win or lose in the playoffs.  Then everybody can keep trolling on the lakers.
UtahQuad::Laker Bandwagoner Alert!
domingocolin::I dont want to see the $@%!$@% Jazz in the playoffs.
King of the Echo People::Deron Williams is 0-4 vs the Jazz. Awesome.
oczonie::Looking at the remaining schedule, Jazz have 4 winnable home games left.  Lakers have only 3.  Lakers have one remaining back to back, one of which is a guaranteed loss since they have never swept a back to back (and this is on the road against the Blazers).  Jazz are in good shape if they can win the rest of their home games (the OKC game is the question mark -- that is the 5th home game).  Win that, and you're in.  You hold the tiebreaker!
unknownmonkey26::And to add to the difficulty, Portland typically plays quite well against the lakers when in Portland.  I would expect no less from the Blazers for the upcoming game, especially if it means an opportunity to really hurt the laker's playoff's odds.
birdman3802::Don't let those delusional Lakers fans get you Jazz fans down, they're just mad they know they're not going to make the playoffs. This coming from a Mavs fan.
Greygoose crew::Portland payback time on the jazz
King of the Echo People::You're just a mad Portland fan. The Jazz just beat Portland on the road and their chances of beating them at home are much higher.
JWalk9267::Jazz win by 10 on the road, what on earth do you think will change when they come back home?
Greygoose crew::Utah sucks
Rezo201::You turn the ball over 17 times and let the other team shoot almost 60% from 3 on the road you don't have much of a chance. Even the Bobcats could beat you with that combo. At least D-Will and Brook played well...
ESmodPN::LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!!
JWalk9267::Lakers will have a 100% record in the playoffs this year. but that depends on whether or not you believe 0-0 is 100%...
oczonie::Lakers playing for the 9nth playoff spot!
KKhan04::Demarcus Cousins is by far the dumbest player in the NBA.
pfcsnow7::nah man javel maghee is pretty $@%!$ dumb lol
pacificharlie::Way to go Utah, take back your #8 position, run over those old and slow Lakers.
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::GO SAC GO
R Barron::Time for Kobe to start throwin up some bricks. Come mamba, take this game over!
Mets2410::$@%!$@% randy foye. that is all. go Nets.
leloupgarou111::corbin deserves to be fired after all these carrol dnp
King of the Echo People::I don't understand it, Carroll at least deserves to come off the bench and get a few minutes.
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::maimi &gt; utah &gt; nets &gt; lakers  just my 2 sense tho, take it or leave it
TJ1234509876::2 cents?

leloupgarou111::look at his user name
Nayrock10::The Nets is making NYC look bad damn but great job jazz not you are still in the 8th spot lol
BroncosLions::Lost to the Jazz, lost to the Nuggets. Just proving the lack of depth in the Eastern Conference
Mets2410::losing to the Nuggets in Denver is a bad thing? They're 33-3 at home and have won 17 straight there
R Barron::Carroll dnp. Okay
BroncosLions::JZ is not meant for basketball!
Nayrock10::THE NETS SHOULD MOVE OUT OF NYC AND GO BACK NJ LMAO,POOR JAY-Z!
BroncosLions::Nets suck hahahahahaha!

Francis4345::Did it very quietly
RawHeadRex2012::WTF Brooklyn?!
pfcsnow7::your still surprised they blew a gm they needed to win lol
knicks_11::1 Billion dollar arena  highest payroll in NBA  JJ and Deron playing their worst basketball in their career.  Coaching change..  why arent they not criticized? oh wait, they suck thats why!
adamsbrian88::Can't hardly see whats going on over on the lakers kings board its getting trolled so hard.
Francis4345::Hurt my eyes
Duya Boss::Gosh the Nets are a disgrace
Francis4345::No Jazz awesome at home.
knicks_11::" We are the better and will be better than the knicks in 1 year"
adamsbrian88::Could be much worse
free derrick favors::Favors almost with another double double in 20 minutes
Nayrock10::Aww lmao

mikeisildur::I was sad watching Kanter tie his shoe one-handed in the locker room =(
mikeisildur::Good night for your  boy!
Nayrock10::No 1 care about the Nets not even in NYC I GUESS THE NETS SHOULD OF STAY IN NJ CUZ THE NETS ARE NOT BUILD TO PLAY IN NYC BUT GREAT JOB JAZZ.

mikeyjm1412::Still, we need him... Unless the knicks are willing to give JR away for a bag of rocks...
David535221::He aint even as god as JR SMITH
Francis4345::Good signs, Jazz been one of the worst team at 3 pointers last year, Foye and Mo delivered the past 2 games in 2 nights. Even if Hayward been quiet beyond the arc tonight.
knicks_11::NEts Blow  like Humpries Ex wife
scow79::They blow quite nicely then...Or, so I've heard.
mikeyjm1412::It could be worse... I could be a suns fan... lol
David535221::poor mikey he mad nets cant even beat a jazz team knicks killed twice without there superstars and only got jj to wait for who isnt even better then the knicks bench play JR SMITH
mikeyjm1412::You guys just blow less than we do... But you still blow...
knicks_11::we actually beat the jazz  without our 4 top guns  :)
mikeyjm1412::-___- Knicks blow too so go get your personal knicks job before the playoffs start already...
knicks_11::Lol. its true
