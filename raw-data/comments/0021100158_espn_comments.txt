CALIstateofmind777::When are we going to cut andris??? 2 points 6 fouls...LEAVE!!!
darren novotny::lets not forget he missed 18 of those free throws, 18! GS's game plan was working to some extent...
TheBandwagonMan::You must be having the same prob with this site as me right now?
darren novotny::lets not forget he missed 18 of those record setting 39 free throws, 18! GS's game plan was working to some extent...
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::Cant wait til Howard is back home playing for his hometown Hawks
TheBandwagonMan::I would be happy for you guys, and I really woudn't mind seeing him go to a team that has been in the spotlight as much as the more popular teams. BUT, I really doubt that will happen. ATL has less to offer ORL than teams like LAL, DAL, or even NY but, you never know.
TheBandwagonMan::I just turned on my computer and seen that Howard went for 45 and 23! I'm not a Magic fan, but these #'s are incredible wether you like him or not. However, GS' gameplan obviously played a part, but I really don't care how he put up these stats. Now, I realize what GS did, but if you are dominant enough for a team to devise a gameplan as crazy as this one, then IMO, you have earned the stats. Howard is a scary dude. I see alot of LAL fans talking about how they might want to keep Bynum instead of trading for Howard, but the fact is, Howard is the best center in the NBA and it's not even close. Really, NOT EVEN CLOSE!
TheBandwagonMan::Just think, Greg Oden was supposed to be like this. . . I feel bad for Portland's fans, but they seem to be playing just fine without Oden (and Roy).
dabulls2012::From the ESPN highlight package...it looked like MANY 3-point plays too so it was GSW fouling him and he was still getting the ball up and in...pretty impressive even though GSW has NOBODY up front to even come close to guarding this guy...
TheBandwagonMan::You're right. Zo was quite a bit more refined in his game and IMO had a much greater basketball IQ. However, Howard has a little bit more offensive talent. As far as defense, it's probably a wash, but Howard is also a slightly better rebounder IMO. . . If I had to choose between Howard and Mourning (both in their primes), I would probably take Mourning just because, as you said, his game was more refined, plus he was a VERY smart player. Howard is slightly more physically gifted though.
dabulls2012::I think Alonzo was a little bit more refined away from the basket but I could be wrong...not a bad comparison...probably as close as you can get...Dikembe was similar defensively but maxed out his scoring as a rookie with 16.3ppg...Dwight scores a LOT more than that...of course Alonzo also averaged just under 70% from the FT line...if Dwight could do that...WOW!
TheBandwagonMan::He reminds me of Alonzo Mourning alot.
TheBandwagonMan::***Triple Post***  oops!
TheBandwagonMan::**Double Post**
darkyam::39 foul shots means at least 20 fouls (since I highly doubt he'd ever be fouled taking a 3).  That means 3 people's worth of fouling out.  Plus, it means that a simple hand-check violation or charge means 2 free throws now for anyone else.  Lastly, yeah, it may take the Magic out of their rhythm, but it also takes the fouling team out of theirs and makes fast break points almost impossible.  Doing it in the final four minutes of a tight game: great idea.  Doing it an entire game: horrible idea.
TheBandwagonMan::Plus, alot of these fouls are probably 'and-1's', meaning there is only 1 foul shot for that foul. It could have been much more than 20 fouls?
81WASIV::its such a stupid strategy when done to this extreme. it gives the Magic free points while taking no time off the clock to do so. you foul the guy when he gets the ball in the post to prevent easy baskets; NOT every damn possession. look how well this worked Magic score 117 and Dwight gets 45. Mark Jackson is a really stupid coach. fouled out the W's only center w/ over 7 mins left by doing this crap and took away all fast break opportunities for the W's(the team's only strength). and he broke Chamberlain's record in an illegitimate way.
MacolmX::Dwight and Kobe will be teamed up.
dabulls2012::Does Howard even think about the fact he could have gone well over 50 just by shooting 70% from the line last night? How about some granny-style? How can you be considered an elite player when you can't make your FTs down the stretch? I guess that question could go to LeBron too...
ZzTrueAznBallerZz::nice! u dont have to be a elite player to make your free throw!
darkyam::Back-to-back-to-back DPOY awards sounds pretty elite to me, especially when averaging over 20 a game
dabulls2012::I don't agree...if you can't be counted on at the end of the game to help your team win, you can't be elite. DPOY is nice, but ZERO rings is not quite as nice. Ben Wallace won 4 times in 5 years...but his Pistons actually won a ring in there too although it was the one year he didn't win. Mutombo won the award 4 times too and his teams never did squat.  Howard is a great player...no question about that, but elite??? He's certainly the best center in the NBA right now so that should make him elite I guess, but there are just NO other good centers...maybe we'll finally see what Bynum can do if he can stay healthy...
twentyanite::Howard is gonna look real good in a laker uniform. the stars are getting alligned
HANDSOMETIGERBRETT::You suck
dabulls2012::I think you're right even though he keeps saying he doesn't want to follow in Shaq's footsteps...  I read another columnist talking about how many boards Dwight would get off Kobe's misses...LOL
dabulls2012::** Double Post**
dabulls2012::I thought the common denominator was Derek Fisher...doesn't he have a ring for every ring Kobe has?  And Dwight says a LOT of things...guy should be in politics the way he waffles back and forth...I'm not sure I've ever heard him say he wants to win and actually mean it. I mean nobody wants to lose, but some guys actually WORK harder to make sure they don't lose...guys like Kobe, Mike and Derrick.
twentyanite::kobe shoots it at 45-46% for the year and 45% for his career. most importantly kobe is the greatest winner the nba has seen since mike. dwight says he wants to win. give kobe a star inside presence and he delivers( shaq, Gasol/bynum, and hopefully howard. LA is about to build its 3rd dynasty in the last 15 years. common demoninator = kobe.
joshuality101::how do you miss 18 free throws????
XhinghFu::Marc Jackson's strategy and logic is flawed. Fifty percent free throw shooting, one point per field goal attempt, is the same as taking two field goal attempts to make one two point shot. Teams with defenses that allow its opponents to shoot fifty percent almost always lose. I watched GS employ this strategy twice (once versus the Clippers) and both games they lost.
Otis Smith...::2012 where Dwight gets traded to the Warriors
abenezer44::not if stephen curry doesnt come back fully healthy and prove he can still ball
Otis Smith...::Orlando trade Dwight for David Lee and Monta Ellis  /  Warriors Trade Dwight for  Scola and Lowry.
ebase131::Dwight Howard was about to be questioned by reporters following the record number of free throws, but then he was fouled and had to shoot two free throws.
DaPhillies::Why is it that people come on nba boards to talk about how much they hate the nba??  Does anyone do that for any other sport??  Its not like I go on hockey boards or soccer boards and trash those leagues.  Can someone explain?  Im genuinely curious
DaPhillies::No answer, huh? ok
panthers_02::same thing would have happened even if warriors had brown. there is n way brown is good enough to gaurd dwight the whole game history has proven that. the only center in the game that challenges him is andrew " made of glass" bynum who tends to get in fould trouble anyway
Orlandomagic2323::3-0 on the road-trip nice job orlando!
chiz2kul::Amazing.  http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/7455943/believing-tim-tebow
300poundwizard::this "hack-a-shaq" crap has to stop. its ugly basketball and is no fun to watch. c'mon nba, i thought you were better than this
csmeech::Completely agree.  Thats not entertainment and has no real value to me.  It's an embarassment to the league, but then again , the warriors have always been an embarassment to the NBA.
sodas32::The warriors are unknown they beat the heat but then lose a couple in a row???
mark35345::The regular season is like that - it's just a pre season. The Warriors have no chance to be a competitive playoff team this year
Cdot22495::so far it's worked out to a 3-7 record.  keep up the good work jackson
ColtsLakers91::I don't particularly like it either, but does it really matter whether or not it's fun to watch?  If it works, it works.
SAFrankSU::It's a horrible sport. They should have cancelled the season. LSU/Bama &gt; NBA
swagopotamus3::good strategy
LaTony Pepperoni::The Kobe v LeBron arguments which litter the ESPN boards are just farcical. One man has SEVEN years still to go to be in line with the other's playing time and  HAS JUST HIT HIS PRIME at age 27.  Please, Kobe is a legend of the game, no doubt. He has the 5 rings, the MVP,  the whole lot, WE KNOW THAT. But please, let's not judge LeBron until about 2018 when he's at least done the same miles as Kobe and had as many chances. Aside from the fact that this is the second year in LeBron's entire career that he has had help. I hope you understand i am not disparaging Kobe. He's a LEGEND. But don't compare someone based on stats when one party has only had half the time to play than the other.
twentyanite::difficult not to judge lebron when the espn hype machine year in and year out annoints him as the king.  my question is, just what exactly is he the king of?? i gotta know.
sodas32::I hate kobe. But come on man he dropped 48 and then 40
swagopotamus3::Kobe is a rapist and an adulterer
1_old_ham::Hack a Howard.
whitebl09::It was not good strategy because even though he shot only slightly above 50 percent from the line that's still about 20 points you pretty much gave away to fouls as well as getting your big men in foul trouble and disrupting your team's rhythm. You have to play better D.. Double and rotate well, fouling when necessary, and hope he goes something like 5 for 17 from the line instead of giving him 30+ chances at it.
abenezer44::even though its kwame brown, dwight would not go off if he was playing the way he did. dwight is not a good offensive player against legitimate defense, he killed because hes playing the undersized warriors.
AItheAnswer0001::Dwight is clearly a good offensive player but he lacks touch and he's turns the ball over a little too much at times. Dude was going off last year in the playoffs though.
Humanreck::Wow Mark Jackson is a god awful coach.  The sad thing is after he is fired (which will be soon) he will be back on the air with his terrible commentating.  I cringe every time he busts out his "mama there goes that man" trash
CALIstateofmind777::we are 3-7!! shut up. nothing tough about that!!!
abenezer44::wow mark and jeff van gandy were most of the time cool together as analyst, and warriors are much tougher right now with mark than they ever been.
Bill_Simmons_Sports_Guy::39 FT attempts and only 45 points? and magic won by only 8? Howard better get that percentage up or Magic games will start taking 35 minutes longer than the avg NBA game.
Brac987::Why couldn't the lock-out have lasted for a year? Or a decade? Or better yet, forever?
adonfraz::I don't know what Mark Jackson is thinking? He did the same hack-a-center thing against the Clippers with Deandre Jordan. How about teaching your team how to play some D.
SteelersPenguinsPiratesPanthers::The ol' "fight-a-dwight" strategy
jas::More evidence that NBA basketball is completely broken. Don't touch the stars!
Talentsojhin::It really is getting painful to watch.
Da-Bears1985::And he made 54% of them.  He'll be seeing the line a lot more at that rate.
ZZ_SIDEWAYS::Puts me in the mood for chicken.
Rogerfromamericandad::Mark Jackson will be fired next season, maybe after this one
IHATEDAVIDSTERN666::LOL i heard Don Nelson got fired from GSW for trying to force Biedrins to shoot granny style from the stripe ala Rick Barry.
Dave34613::Bird took 453 free throws in 1987 and only missed 38...Howard missed half of that in one game and has already missed 72 this season....I guess that's what happens when you take 500 free throws per day in the off-season instead of making commercials!
IHATEDAVIDSTERN666::Agree Larry Bird and Mark Price and Reggie Miller were just automatic from the stripe.
Rolo Tomasi 14::Who cares about that record, not like he had much control over it.
NightLifeCruiser::Both of these teams are a joke. NEXT!
cnoteice1906::8 - 3 is a joke team?
rrobis01::dear god i hope this is an isolated incident.  nothing like watch a basketball game take as long as a baseball game.  boooooooring.
Dave34613::Wow, Dwight is so dominating down low, we better foul him before he scores 20 points on us!
Otis Smith...::Get Ready to play for the team u just beat Dwight!!!
kool9584::Hack a Howard fail
tandyman8::Howard only shot a bit over 50% from the line.. Not a bad strategy.  But he's also admitting that his team can't play with the Magic straight up.  He did the same thing to the Clipper's DeAndre Jordan earlier this year.
John Claytons Combover::that's some fine free throw shootin.....when Wilt took 34 free throws, he also scored 61 points.
ColtsLakers91::Is anyone else starting to think that Marc Jackson is on a quest to be so annoying as a coach that people actually CLAMOR for him to come back to commentating?
sirmacalot2::Chamberlain set the record for attempts the night he scored 100. He also set the record for makes. Dantley tied it, but 28-32 for him was insane.
clam608::This is why Jackson will never be a good coach (not you Phil)
Sports_Fanatic_3::the person that wrote this article put Shaq attempted 39 free throws in the 2009 playoffs, nooooo.....it was in 2000.  gee wiz!
hulKKNUPE::Blame Mark Jackson for the 'hack-a-Howard' He said he'd do it EVERY time he played Dwight if he was a coach.
pmbrown49::This is why the NBA has become a joke.  They should have stayed on strike.  NCAAB is the only exciting basketball being played today.
Da-Bears1985::NCAA? Maybe in March.
sirmacalot2::go die. NBA is fine.
nickd717::JJ Redick needs to give Howard some pointers on free throw shooting.
hulKKNUPE::JJ Redick needs to work on being more consistent. Esp. when the Magic play tough defensive teams.
