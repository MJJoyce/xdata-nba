lllllll llll::Kanter: 17 Pts, 9 Reb, 2 Ast, 5 Blk in just 17 minutes.  I wonder how effective he would be if a certain coach let him play more often?
NYeltigre::You forget about the fact that over the last three games he was like 3 /14 with 7 points. He had a good game but is still raw. He does need more minutes but not starter minutes yet.
ensign.devyn::Well, I would rather start Favors and Millsap and give Kanter a good 20 minutes off the bench, but you're right, he's not capable of starter minutes at the moment. However, his D makes up for when his O is poor.
JAHQUAN3::We've seen enough of Kanter to know he gets about the minutes that he should. Bully ball does not work against the top tiers teams and he's an offensive foul or traveling waiting to happen. So he still needs work, by next season he should be ready to start....Well Maybe.
ensign.devyn::So what was last night, a fluke? Kanter needs minutes to develop, and especially to learn and implement things on the court. Yeah, sometimes his O is a little shaky, but his defense alone makes him valuable to play as much as we can. He may not score a lot some nights, but he doesn't give up a lot either. Whereas Jefferson may score a lot (with a LOT of shots) but he gives up just as much, and most of the time, gives up more than he scores. That is why his +/- is the 2nd worst on the team, and is awful when compared across the NBA. I'd rather see a young guy play who doesn't give up a lot of points, has the potential to do what he did last night, even if it doesn't happen every time he steps on the court, than someone who we already know what we're always going to get from.
Darkflame07::Jefferson was pretty effective too. Favors and kanter will get more time next year because at least 1 of al or Paul will be gone. Until then this is how it will be so what's the point in $@%!$@%! about it every night?
landcplus6::We don't want to wait until next year.  Al had 19 and 11 in 31 minutes which is nice.  But his defense was typical of Al and Kanter's defense was great.  I think that Favors and Kanter have shown enough this year that they are ready for the increased minutes that will fast track their development.  This cannot happen with Al on the team.  It has been nice to have Al here for the past few years, but his time has arrived to move along.  Is it wrong of fans to want the best for their team and complain if they see a problem?  I submit that it is NOT!

ensign.devyn::Only 2.5 games behind GS now (I think they're going to drop a little more too), and only 3 behind Memphis (they'll probably keep dropping too). Let's pass them. Get at least that 6th seed.
free derrick favors::Maybe they'll start tanking by instinct and not even realize it
mikeisildur::ROFL.  Inborn behavior.  Salmon swim upstream, Warriors lose games and tank at the end of seasons.
scow79::All I know is we went on a 6-0 run, a 9-0 run and were beginning an 11-0 run when Burks, Carrol, Millsap, Favors and Kanter were in the game in the 2nd quarter.
ensign.devyn::Wasn't it awesome earlier in the year when the Denver fans were all pissed cause Carroll had a dang good game against them, and they were all "so he's not good enough for us, but he's good enough for the Jazz, and then he comes back and smokes us?"
scow79::He only played in 4 games for them.   Went 6-6.   They should have kept him and played him a little more.
ensign.devyn::rbmw263 Kanter will put up nicer looking numbers but Favors will have a bigger impact  Like when Favors got subbed in late in the 3rd, blocked 2 shots, altered 1 more, grabbed a board, and played excellent defense in 2 whole minutes? It's amazing how much he changes our D when he's on the court.
rbmw263::Its going to be even more amazing when he doesnt have to devote 99% of his focus to covering for Allan
ensign.devyn::Allah?  *Sorry, Muslims*
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Alowishus
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Alfonso
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Alvin
ensign.devyn::Allame?
rbmw263::Albert
rbmw263::Alfred?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I don't think Kanter has yet realized how much stronger he is than 99% of the league.
ensign.devyn::And help Burks with Jennings. It was a thing of beauty tonight, that team D with those 3 on the floor.
scow79::I just liked watching Favors and Kanter rotate on defense tonight and work together.
ensign.devyn::Yes, like when he backs people down and gets charges, haha. He just looks at the refs like "I wasn't even going that hard." He's such a beast boxing out already, and he does it fundamentally. Ah, i love it!
karelp::Jefferson should probably replace Howard on the All-Star team if Dwight can't play.
scow79::God no!   Then the Jazz would be sure to re-sign him
free derrick favors::Probably
scow79::I like how you think, but my scenario is far more likely
free derrick favors::Or get a better trade for him
ensign.devyn::I dunno, that game requires tough D, and Al's not capable of tough D.
free derrick favors::Best superbowl commercial this year?

ensign.devyn::Ha! Beat ya to it ;)

TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::In Soviet Russia, name spells you!
ensign.devyn::He's not a Jazz man anymore, I don't owe him anything, including the proper spelling of his foreign name. Got it?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I just figured that's who you meant, since Kirilenko spells his name "Andrei."
ensign.devyn::Does he have a tattoo?

ensign.devyn::What an awesome website that would be to own.
caseygreer2::Question jazz fans. Who ends up being the better player, Favors or Kanter. GO
JAHQUAN3::Favors
rbmw263::Kanter will put up nicer looking numbers but Favors will have a bigger impact
caseygreer2::If Favors can ever develop a jump shot, I think Favors. If not, Kanter.
caseygreer2::It is improving, I agree.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Already getting developed.
ensign.devyn::Such a tough call. But Favors.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Whoever works harder.
ensign.devyn::Tremors, what percentage of our posts do you think are really serious? 35, 40%?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::No way. It's like 4-6%. It's a 20 to 1 shot.
ensign.devyn::Nahhh. Less than my estimate though, now that I really think about it.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::"...the team with the biggest need for an upgrade at center is the Spurs. The inability to protect the rim was one of the prime reasons for their collapse in last year’s Western Conference finals."  Anyone else not think the Spurs would be foolish enough to think Al protects the rim?
ensign.devyn::They're referring to when Al is playing on a 9 foot hoop, with a trampoline underneath the rim, and the entire court is padded, like a holding cell that I will eventually waste away in if we re-sign him next year.
caseygreer2::Seriously, that was one of the first red flags about this rumor....
ensign.devyn::Why can't Hayward be French? Then my jersey could say "Gord'on bleu"
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::What if he's just sad?
ensign.devyn::One day I will make one of those movies. And I will go absolutely nowhere with that. And I'm okay with that.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::People of France: A good looking, depressed guy, smoking a cigarette is not a movie.
scow79::Bonjour, you cheese-eating surrender monkeys!

caseygreer2::Right now I'd be wary when shopping for a jazz jersey. Who knows who will be here in the next few years. I don't think anybody is safe.
free derrick favors::Yeah but I think the method the Jazz use create a winning environment along with a competitive environment that will help out in the long run.
caseygreer2::I'd be pretty sure if our organization actually committed to him instead of playing him just 20 min a night in his third year.....
free derrick favors::unless our front office is down right handicapped.
free derrick favors::I'm pretty sure Favors is safe
ensign.devyn::Or dark blue :)
ensign.devyn::It's an on-court advantage, like having to play Boise in blue on their smurf turf
scow79::That thing makes my eyes hurt
Wombat1247::Any more updates or rumors about the possiable trade for AL to the Spurs?
Wombat1247::Thanks - I did not see this happening anyway
rbmw263::Im sure one of the fastest paced teams in the league is dying to get Big Al
adamsbrian88::The source i found was some 3rd party website, there's no way to know if they actually know whats going on
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yep. Malarkey.
adamsbrian88::Sheridan Hopps http://www.sheridanhoops.com/2013/02/06/sheridan-al-jefferson-to-spurs/
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::^^^ Check for spelling and grammatical errors.
ensign.devyn::Was it the SLC Tribune?
scow79::Nothing.  Like someone said earlier.   I can't imagine anything leaking out from either club, so it's probably just something someone came up with.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::It's balderdash
scow79::So whose jersey would you guys buy who is on this team.   I'm guessing for Tremors it's Kanter since he already has that one.  Do they even have Burks jersey's?
scow79::Mine would be Trey Burke.
ensign.devyn::Burke will take the #4, and then you can get a #104 that says Burke(s)
Wombat1247::Favors then Hayward
rbmw263::I would get a custom one and put "Faburkanward"  on the back
scow79::Haha!   Very nice!
ensign.devyn::They have Burks jerseys. For me, it's a custom green Gordo with "G-Time" on the back
ensign.devyn::Hahaha
scow79::Vanilla Cobra!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yeah, Kanter was the one I wanted, so that's the one I got.
adamsbrian88::First pick would be Favors then Hayward then Kanter
adamsbrian88::missed the only pick one part....
free derrick favors::Hmmmm
free derrick favors::Raja was my first choice. Tinsley would be my second option

scow79::4th game in a row DeMarre scored in double digits.   I really hope we re-sign the guy.   He's grown on me.
free derrick favors::Agree. He is everything the Jazz have been about. Hustle and hard work
ensign.devyn::Mo's tough too. Foye always gives lots of effort, but I wouldnt' call him "tough". But yes, we for sure resign Foye, and Mo is pretty likely
scow79::Throw in Foye and Mo Williams.   I have no doubt they will re-sign Foye and Mo Williams.
ensign.devyn::I'm excited over the thought of Paul, Favors, Kanter, Demarre, Gordo, Burks all getting big minutes in the future. All tough players.
ensign.devyn::He shot awful too. But got to the line and got hustle baskets. Which, at the moment, makes him more valuable than Marvin. I think with a good pg that opens up the court, Marvin is a slightly more valuable.
ensign.devyn::Yeah, true true. Marvin hit one of those, for I believe his only points of the night. Haha
scow79::I think he was forced to take some 3's late in the shot clock in the first half.  Not his forte.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I own but two Jazz jerseys: A white note logo AK47 and a green Kanter.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::My brother still wears the black and copper Stockton jersey. Ha.
tfoutz31::Classy!
scow79::I only have a D-Will jersey.   I wanted Millsap so of course my wife bought me Williams.
ensign.devyn::^That's my next one, custom done with "G-Time" on the back instead of "Hayward". Green, of course.
scow79::Nah, I still like the grump.  I'll just have to buy a more current one eventually.   Probably Gordo.
rbmw263::If you are one of the Jazz fans that dislike D-Will i would gladly take it off your hands..
scow79::Last year it was Howard.   That one was a b.itch to spell out.
ensign.devyn::My little bro,a nd my little sis have Millsap ones. Man, I hope we dump Jefferson and resign Paul, and not the other way around
scow79::Now I have to spell out Foye in masking tape and cross out Williams.
ensign.devyn::Beautiful. I still have my Harpring one somewhere, and have my green Price jersey.
free derrick favors::I'm watching the game again and I just saw a spectacular play. Kanter defended the pick and roll PG and then recovered to actually box out and get a rebound all in the same play. I didn't even know this was possible.
dahojas::That or you're just used to watching slow foot Al defend.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::The underkanter, if you will.
ensign.devyn::I think that was under-lying joke.
rbmw263::Kanter is making some big improvements defensively
ensign.devyn::Yeah, for sure. Man, I can't wait till both those guys are getting close to 30 a night, or over 30
rbmw263::He said he's been watching Derrick.  and yeah the weight loss has helped a ton too
ensign.devyn::Gotten much quicker, for sure.
dahojas::Kanter is a beast. The Jazz should be building their future around him and get rid of Jefferson.
ensign.devyn::WE KNOW. Haha
dahojas::Before tonight all you could say was they needed to build around Favors. I think Kanter is better and has more potential than Favors. Kanter is who they need to build around and focus on.
scow79::Whenever I see a Al Jefferson jersey all I feel is pity for whoever bought it and now has to wear it.
scow79::All I think is "Man, you bought the wrong one."
ensign.devyn::My older brother wore his to ball last night. Bad call, bro. Many jokes ensued
ensign.devyn::Oh yeah, he's a good defender. Really is a pretty good player, but everytime he made a mistake we could draw a tangent to something Al does wrong, and it was just so great.
tfoutz31::Did he at least play some defense?
tfoutz31::Went to the game tonight, saw on about 4 racks of clothes all Jefferson jerseys 50% off is it a sign!?
tfoutz31::or maybe trades in the works? I'm only hoping...
ensign.devyn::I honestly think we either trade, or let him go.
scow79::A sign that many people aren't fans of Jefferson.
ensign.devyn::Yes, a sign that no one wants to buy anything to do with him anymore...
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I have a hunch the Jazz will finish 60-22
ensign.devyn::Your hunches don't work out much, do they?
ensign.devyn::^^Not as bad as Portland's, thankfully
rbmw263::our remaining road games are brutal
scow79::Their schedule gets much more difficult coming up which I'm certain you and your hunch are well aware of.
rbmw263::all of this w/o a couple of our best players
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Not even a little bit, but if they play the way they've played since the calendar flipped, they could hit 50.
free derrick favors::I just noticed Kanter almost had a triple dub in 17 minutes...
ensign.devyn::And here I've been living in a world of closed-off possibilities
free derrick favors::Not if Corbin can help it
ensign.devyn::Jazz players are capable of triple doubles?
rbmw263::"Jazz lead the nba in wins after trailing after the first quarter"  you dont say
ensign.devyn::When you're the 32nd team in 1st quarter scoring, and a playoff team, it's bound to happen. hahaha
ensign.devyn::Yes.
ensign.devyn::Behind Kanter's abs there are no organs... just more abs.
ensign.devyn::5/16 shooting for Jennings with Burks on him a good amount. Was great help D at times for Burks, and Jennings missed some shots, but we didn't let him get into a rhythm. Shows what Burks can do on D, as Jennings is about as quick of a get-to-your-spot-and-shoot type PG in the league
scow79::I think Burks' length did bother Jennings a bit
ensign.devyn::Which is also why I love when Gordo plays D on the opposing PG from time to time.
King of the Echo People::Karl Malone has again said that he wants to help coach up the big guys and he even said he'd do it for free. I really hope the Jazz finally take him up on his offer this time. He could work with the big guys in the summer.
ensign.devyn::Idk... before we know it, Favors and Kanter will be showing up to games in cowboy hats and leather boots.
ensign.devyn::Next season we are going to be making Kanter / mountain man / chuck norris type jokes
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Oh my!
rbmw263::Deer....Moose....Bear....Sharks..
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I imagine Kanter hunting a deer down and killing it with his bare hands.
ensign.devyn::I don't think Kanter knows hunting has seasons here too, he might get arrested in the offseason for sniping a deer off of 1-15...
rbmw263::Favors could use some time with the mailman...if it means he turns into a cowboy then so be it
King of the Echo People::As long as they use their elbows and dominate I'm all for it.
jason21382::Utah!
ensign.devyn::State Aggies?
ensign.devyn::Speaking of Corbin, he hit the .500 mark in his overall coaching record tonight. Not too bad doing that with what he's had to deal with, only 50 games into his first real season, after a crappy first half of the season he inherited, and a lockout shortened season last year. I believe Corbin can be a good coach, this is his first full year.
scow79::Are you and Corbin making up or something?
ensign.devyn::^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::That page might have been to the 2nd page of the stat sheet, where the bench players were listed.
ensign.devyn::Yeah, probably. I really hope he's turned a page. Bulls game will be a good teller, tough opponent at home.
scow79::I forced myself to, but yes, I know what you're saying.   It's easy to tear down, hard to build up.  I'm sure we'll be right back at it as soon as he makes another move we don't agree with or Big Al watches a guy lay the ball in the basket.
ensign.devyn::Nah, I'm just recognizing that he's coached very well the last few games, and am hoping he keeps it up. I do think we've all been a touch hard on him, deservedly so at times, so I'm just giving him praise when he deserves it. As I noticed you did with Big Al tonight
scow79::Come on Lindsey!   Make a trade already!   I'm pining for the next player I get to complain about and despise!  Last year it was Raja, BJ Smiles and Josh Howard  This year it is Jefferson and Watson, with a little bit of Raja Bell thrown in for good measure.
King of the Echo People::Freaking Raja Bell. Making $$$$ sitting on his @ss at home.
ensign.devyn::Living the dream
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::BJ SMILES!!!
ensign.devyn::"What was that clank sound?"  BJ Smiles
scow79::BJ Smiles for 3!!!!!  Clank!!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::PER is the greatest tool we have to judge a player's value and ability.
D.Wagner85::Marijuana is the best drug in the world, so safe it only has a 100% higher cancer rate then cigarettes.........................
rbmw263::which is why people should be eating it
ensign.devyn::I don't think that's true... ;)
ensign.devyn::I know there's plenty of animosity for Corbin on here, but doesn't it seem like the last few games things have started to click a little better in his brain? He's subbing out 1st or 2nd units when he should be, like tonight, he's letting Burks finish games, tonight he let Demarre, idk, I really believe he's starting to see our team clearer
D.Wagner85::Another thing to remember, you will see a lot of odd lineups in games the next 2 weeks, as your GM, and other GM's want to either see value, or try to elevate value of players.
D.Wagner85::I like Corbin as a coach, if the Jazz add a few more defensive minded players, would really give them a solid shot to be a top 4 team in the West over the next 5+ years, which means you have a title chance.
ensign.devyn::Yeah, true, but some of it is him adjusting his rotations and subs based on how people are playing any given night.
acidflow03::True all while having the starting PG and Mr. Do it all Hayward out well Hayward being out less games but still.. so give him some credit I mean some teams (Lakers) couldnt even win with one guy out let alone two important ones.
King of the Echo People::I think Corbin is doing fine. He's getting better as time goes on. Just remember the crappy situation he was given when Sloan retired and the Jazz traded Deron Williams.
D.Wagner85::Last few games, you guys have won 11 of your last 15 games.
ensign.devyn::Yeah, and he lost us the Portland game by subbing Tinsley in, who gave up 2 layups in a row. We've won that many because we've played so many at home.
rbmw263::I want to believe he is getting better until Kanter plays like a god and only gets 16 minutes
rbmw263::OK FORGET PER, the guy had 13, 7, and 2 in 9 freaking minutes
ensign.devyn::I know, I know. That's what they're doing, and they're making sure they get their minutes so they can resign at least 1 of them, if a trade doesn't work out.
TAC0REV::Even if Kanter went for 20 &amp; 10 on 10-for-10 in five minutes, Corbin still wouldn't increase his playing time.
D.Wagner85::If coaches coached based on PER, they would have some of the worst teams in the league, prime example, Kyle O'Quinn of the Magic, dude sucks, yet has a very high PER.
rbmw263::Im hoping that they really are giving Al and Paul the minutes to keep trade value high
rbmw263::I agree, but nobody demands time as much as a guy who had a PER in the 90's in the first half
ensign.devyn::Yeah, there's just so many people that demand time on our team. He's in a tough position.
D.Wagner85::Every Bucks fan on here that is a tax payer, all the City wants is 100 dollars from every tax payer over the next 5 years, yet people are rejecting the idea( I mean come on, you will spend 100 on burgers but not something that actually results in you having a higher quality of life?), that is why Stern wants the team out of Milwaukee, the Bucks bring in 32 million a year to local workers because they are the sole reason the BC is still open for business, take away the BC, and Milwaukee is going to be the next Ghost Town in the USA.
Broken j::Well tax me then. I'm all for it. I don't live in Milwaukee though.
D.Wagner85::lol
D.Wagner85::I am in School for Accounting and Economics, it is going to be my future Job to know these things.  Though if the Bucks leave Milwaukee, I am following them wherever they go.
ensign.devyn::I'm sure they can get Weird Al to do the theme song
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Bugs Bunny should have taken a left there.
ensign.devyn::Albequerque
scow79::What is the BC?
scow79::Gotcha
D.Wagner85::Bradley Center, where the Bucks are currently playing.
caseygreer2::It's actually kinda impressive :P
ensign.devyn::You know way too much about all the Bucks fans' financial situations
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::You'll never be as awesome as Robert Wagner. If everyone shot for the stars, there'd be no one left here on Earth.
D.Wagner85::I am not related to any popular or important Wagner's, hopefully someday I can make a name for myself, one can always dream.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Are you related to Robert Wagner? That would be cool.
ensign.devyn::Lol, I'm just messin with ya man.
D.Wagner85::No, I did not, I said for all the tax paying Buck fans on here, did you not read the first sentence?
ensign.devyn::But you stated with 100% certainty that every Bucks fan on here is a tax payer... I'm a little scared. Who do you really work for? Be honest. IRS?
D.Wagner85::I am a college student with a part time job, and can easily afford to give 100 dollars toward something that helps the city.
ensign.devyn::Jazz should just start the bench next game and see how it goes, just for kicks and giggles. Let Boozer deal with Favors to start off. Though him and Millsap going at it is going to be epic.
Josh4Jazz::This is one case where I want to see Jefferson against boozer, since boozer is such an awful defender, Jefferson can eat him up just like opposing layers ate up boozer when he played for us
ensign.devyn::I don't have tix, but I might buy some just to go scream at him.
Josh4Jazz::It's going to be so freaking annoying to hear boozer scream every time he drives to the bucket trying to draw a foul. Even when he played for us, I thought it was annoying and too much
ensign.devyn::Josh, agreed. Idk if they'll get matched up lot, but when they do, I hope it's an ownage. And I hope Paul kills him too.
Josh4Jazz::You're right, I didn't think of that. I just want boozer to play bad and get killed on the court. You know our crowd will be all over him
caseygreer2::is Noah back yet, or still hurt? Noah will be on Big Al if that's the case.....
caseygreer2::I really hope Hayward is back by then..... Abusing the bucks in the paint worked this game, but we'll need him to open up the perimeter.
ensign.devyn::Lol, he was saying he hopes Hayward is back by the Bulls game on Friday. and that we need to open the court on Friday. He said nothing about the Jazz playing them the next time, it was all directed to the upcoming Bulls game.
acidflow03::@ensign.devyn umm no im talking about the guy named (caseygreer) who talked about the  the Bucks so I reffered my comment to next time Jazz play the Bucks.. So nice way to make yourself look like an idiot and FAIL at trying to be smart douch.
ensign.devyn::You mean the guy who said "against the bulls next game"? Beautiful reading comprehension.  Dude, I've seen you gettin after Bucks fans the last little bit, just give it up.
acidflow03::@ ensign.devyn  Ummm what in the heck are you talking about I was replying to the guy who mentioned about the Jazz playing the Bucks next game.. so you stop trolling. And I know who Sanders is it was part of the Joke hint hint...
caseygreer2::Sanders is an athletic freak, there is a reason everyone praises him....
ensign.devyn::Acidflow, he's on the Bucks. He didn't play tonight. I don't know when we play the Bucks again, but it's not soon. And furthermore, we're talking about the Jazz/Bulls game on Friday. Quit trolling.
ensign.devyn::Might be. If that pain can work itself out in the next 2 days, I'll be ecstatic. I'm really scared it'll be a lingering injury.
acidflow03::Hayward is going to slam one down on this Sanders guy everyone is all praising over.
caseygreer2::especially against the Bulls tough front line.
I like the Packers::I strongly believe Stern wants the Bucks gone from MIL....I will cry if that day comes....is that guy from Memphis still interested in buying?
Broken j::I think stern just wants the bucks to do something. Anything. Build a new arena or sell the team.
D.Wagner85::No, but I know Dunleavy Senoir is, and I believe the Sentinal said 2-3 others are looking into it.  Bucks need to get a new arena, if they do, Stern will be fine, you need a nice Arena now to be a marketable team.  Big cities are starting to fade in terms of Market value, its becoming more about willing spenders, not Market size, as the sport is more globalized now.
I like the Packers::We need more solid games from Dalembart like last night haha the fact that we lost that game is a travesty
buckspackers23::Ensign.devyn, they're talking about the Denver game last night.
ensign.devyn::Yup, got it
D.Wagner85::The Bucks were being hit more often then the Nuggets in that game, and shot 23 less FT's, you have no viable point ACIDFLOW.  Troll on my friend, troll on.
D.Wagner85::Bucks turned it over a lot, mixed with very suspect officiating, and a blown game is what you get.
D.Wagner85::We are, thank you Tremors, by the way, I agree, that movie is my favorite childhood movie.
ensign.devyn::Ah, yes. My apologies, bucks fans.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I think they are talking about losing to Denver
buckspackers23::The Bucks scored 70 points in the paint and only shot 10 free throws...
ensign.devyn::I mean, it's not like ALL of our big men band dowg low, or Burks was attacking, or Demarre... And the bucks TOTALLY  attack the rim outside of henson. I mean Ellis, Gooden, Ilysova, and everyone else are total above the rim players
acidflow03::im sure you saw how they got abused on the inside then im sure you understand where all the fouls or at least most of them came from
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Super duper
ensign.devyn::SUPER suspect officiating, let me tell ya.
I like the Packers::23 less FTs was it? I was not a happy camper....
Grantox::o man did you guys see burks after game interview! llmao!!! one guys says your +43 the last 4 games then some other stuff, burks say idont know what that even means lol. he didnt seem real comfy in front of the camera like htat! haha was soooo funny
R Barron::Are there any point guards who can be signed this offseason?
Grantox::i wouldnt mind tradin up in draft and getting marcus smart or m carter williams or trey burkes
caseygreer2::Kabongo, Burke, and Smart all look bueno to me. I'm not sold on Michael Carter Williams, especially as a lottery pick.
Grantox::yeah was thinking maybe jazz could get another pick for al and package like 3 picks for a lottery pick. trey burkes looks good tho, and that myck kabongo look like he could have potential we will see tho
scow79::My guess is we'll trade both picks to move up and nab Trey Burke.  I don't think we'll be able to move up high enough to get one of the other two.
scow79::Calderon.  Mo Williams.   CP3, but we know that's not happening.
ATL Bravos_do it for bobby::lowry, mo williams, jarrett jack, c paul, caulderon
caseygreer2::Lol but jazz broadcast said Lowry was an UFA.....love when commentators don't know much :P
D.Wagner85::He does, Jack is probably going to be the best one, and his defense would be a good fit for the Jazz, but he is in the 20-25 range in terms of talent at the PG spot, not sure the Jazz want that.  They are going to do whatever they can to get one in the 5-10 range, which will also be hard.
scow79::Yeah Lowry isn't a free agent
R Barron::Pretty sure Lowry has another year on his contract
D.Wagner85::None that are unrestricted unless (and he likely will) CP3 opts out, though I still think he re-signs with the Clips.
scow79::Wow!   I just saw that Kanter had 5 blocks in 17 minutes.   He was channeling his inner Larry Sanders tonight.
King of the Echo People::No no no, he channeled his inner Mark Eaton.
ensign.devyn::Someone on the court had to
R Barron::Can you explain your picture? lol
scow79::Ricky Gervais in a bathtub.
D.Wagner85::Lol, I guess you can say that.
D.Wagner85::Casey, one thing you need to remember, you are not going to get good value for Big Al or Millsap if you truly feel they are going to leave, because other GM's in the league will know that as well.  Read this offer for Al Jefferson, its a garbage offer, and they are saying it is the best one.  http://hoopshype.com/rumors/tag/utah_jazz
D.Wagner85::Yeah that is always a tough spot for mid to smaller market teams for sure.  I just hope the Jazz do not do that offer, it does not help in any way.
caseygreer2::Agree. If Splitter had a year or two more on his contract I'd like it, but as a FA next year I don't see any upside in doing it.
caseygreer2::I still think we could trade Paul to a contender for a late first round pick, but I agree mostly. I think the best time to trade them would have been last year as their contracts are expiring now, but our FO was dead set on a playoff push.
buckspackers23::Danny Granger is a really intriguing thought. If I were the Pacers, I would probably ship him out because George has flourished with him gone. Who would they want from us? Maybe Ellis if he could accept a lesser role.
I like the Packers::Ellis coming off the bench, prbly Harris would have to be involved and a big....Udoh prbly....I want to hold onto Henson
caseygreer2::I think Ellis would be great coming off the bench.
scow79::Do you Bucks fans like your young players?   Tobias Harris, Henson, Udoh?   Do they have a future on the team?
scow79::Yeah Henson put on some really nice moves against Favors.  I was impressed.
I like the Packers::Henson really is a gem for where we got him, good defensivly and better on offense than ppl realize. Harris hasn't really come into his own and Udoh eats up good minutes, needs to work the post game
D.Wagner85::I like them, but being a small market team, I do not see any developing into a player with a talent level of say Jennings or Sanders.  They all have a lot of value in the league yet, I expect 2 of them may be gone by the deadline to bring in a veteran scorer.
lord of stone::Are you a Jazz fan or Buck fan?
buckspackers23::Ilyasova, Jennings and Sanders are still really young too.
Goon5832::Bucks fans do u see the bucks makin the playoffs
D.Wagner85::For sure, have you seen the teams behind them?  Bucks will keep Jennings and Sanders, and either Ellis or Ersan for the season, and make a bold move to get them better for next season, while still hanging onto a playoff spot this year.
str8clownin007::Prob will get the 8th seed. 76ers won't catch up
buckspackers23::Yeah, who would instead?
Broken j::Mbah a Moute did not play? Injured?
Broken j::Monta Ellis have it all!
ATL Bravos_do it for bobby::jazz should ship marvin off with either al or paul....extend carrol, i love the way he plays and he deserves the minutes off the bench. marvin has just been disappointing
R Barron::Ya, I like it. I really hope we'll extend Foye as well. He's really opened it up.
Darkflame07::Marvin is on the floor purely for defense.
caseygreer2::Shooting 48% this year.
scow79::I'd like Carrol and Marvin to switch roles.   Carrol starts and Marvin comes off the bench and plays with the young guys.
Grantox::i agree! marvin is still worth keeeping around.
R Barron::I agree. Who would start then?
ATL Bravos_do it for bobby::hayward...foye and burks at the 2...oh, and extend foye while they're at it, he fits in perfect with the jazz
