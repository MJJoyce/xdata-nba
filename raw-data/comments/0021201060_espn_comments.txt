JohnsonnnL::Good Game Celtics nice shot by green at the end.
redsox__celtics.::Heat lose celtics win night would have been perfect had the bruins not blown a 5-3 3rd period lead to the Habs...smh
Texans1095::check it out!! http://austinsmithwnis.blogspot.com/2013/03/2013-mlb-predictions.html
goRedSox4champs::41 min for Green, now that's more like it.  And he got the winning shot on a nasty drive.  He had another 20 minutes in him.
paulleena12::so glad doc. drew up for green instead of pierce iso second time around...even though it was catch and shoot.  Getting tiered of Pierce iso, pierce losing the ball and his lousy turnovers.
dichdastardly::Down goes Frazeeeee- yer CHEATS LOSE
dichdastardly::Hate to say it.. but the Cheats losing  was actually better than the Tics winning..
_I Am A Celtic_::Pretty awesome night for some Duke players around the league:  Gerald Henderson:  34 points, 7 rebounds Boozer: 21 points, 17 rebounds Deng:  28 points, 7 boards, 5 dimes   Although J.J. had an off night
Harry1036::shavlik has 2 boards, 2 stls  and 3 pts. another decent night for a dukie. :)
paulleena12::Boozer with 17 Boards.  Dominating.
_I Am A Celtic_::Scary awesome
andrewplayer21::Boston please lose so you can play the Heat in the 1st round.  All Cavs Fans
jimkamlowsky::If the Celts get reasonably healthy to end the season it's not ridiculous to think they could shock the Heat. They match up against them as well as anyone.
ThunderUpUNCPokes::If Miami can play a Celtics team, Pacers, and the Knicks in the playoffs, I feel like one of them could have a shot at knocking them out
skandosok::^ my man you are one smart person
andrewplayer21::Because they can beat the Heat.
paulleena12::Why do you want Celtics to play Heat in the first round?
paulleena12::So the doctor who did Jeff Green's heart surgery was at the game.
Randazzo Peezzeria::ye
Dribbird.::Pierce almost had a quadruple double   19 points 10 rebounds 8 assists 7 TO's
paulleena12::So what is the deal with Paul Pierce.  Bad passes, turnovers, ball knocked out of his hand.  He has been very, very sloppy this year.
_I Am A Celtic_::To his credit, he only had 1 turnover in the 2nd half
beebopbaloop::Tired?
Randazzo Peezzeria::ye

paulleena12::Wow!  Just came back.  Bulls won!!!  If it is not Doc's team, might as well be Thib's team.
Jdzspace::why the f.ck did Keyon sign with Memphis? WTF?
YogaBeer::he wanted to play?    There was that buyout clause at the beginning of the season that stopped him from signing back with the Cs.
KG hates to lose::i know smh
KG hates to lose::Thank you Bulls
YogaBeer::Thank you Refs.   They could've started earlier in the 4th q like they did with the Cs and the Cavs to win those games.
KG hates to lose::lol true
patsfanallday42::the miami heat are a bunch of sore losers and their fans are the worst in the NBA
Jdzspace::why are they sore losers?
PP owns Rondo::Good job Bulls. I hate them but I hate Miami more.
YogaBeer::The thing that really gets me about the Heat fans is they really don't care as long as LeBron James scores 32.
PP owns Rondo::Yes, good job Bulls
YogaBeer::Someone should tell all the miami dogs to go into hiding.   They going to be kicked a bunch in the next month or so.
paulleena12::Heat fans are idiots, morons and absurd.
oblique15::Wow no class  How the Heat exited the game  Crying in the locker room
YogaBeer::... but would we expect anything less?
YogaBeer::LeCryBabies
dichdastardly::hey Mario Chalmers... maybe if you tried to make the shot instead of flopping... it would have had a chance
YogaBeer::at least we can stop with all this nonsense about the heat being the best team ever.
dichdastardly::Yeah,, foul em Cheats,, Prolong yer AGONY... We're LOVING IT
YogaBeer::This is better than sex.  -  Al Bundy
YogaBeer::Where in the Miami did all the LeBron James fans go?  Bwahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
YogaBeer::DAGGER!
dichdastardly::Lebron is such a WEENIE
dichdastardly::ITS OVA
YogaBeer::How come I can't like this more than once?
dichdastardly::Finish dese bum Cheats
YogaBeer::I'm starting to like Boozer.
YogaBeer::Even though he robbed a blind man
oblique15::If the Heat win, do not put it ESPN it will be Called Heat channel
patsfanallday42::it already is
YogaBeer::if chicago loses, we all know the take was on.     every NBA ref should be checked for mafia connections.
dichdastardly::C'mon Chicago
chathlete882221::The Cavs have shown promise but need to find a way to close out games and stop giving up big leads.
YogaBeer::yupp
dichdastardly::The Cheats are going DOWN
YogaBeer::YaY!    America rejoices!
dichdastardly::Hah hah hah... The Cheats are such CRYBABIES
