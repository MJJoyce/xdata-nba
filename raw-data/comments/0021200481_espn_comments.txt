nigel.inagan::LEBRON
ndunks::awesome flop by LBJ when he got hit by his own teammate, foul on hinrich of course
Rook_217::Good win for the Bulls...as for the Heat, rebounding has always been their weak point...this is about not hitting them open threes.  They had multiple opportunities they (mostly Battier) were unable to convert.  If those shots are made, the rebounding disparity once again becomes overlooked.   IMO this team is good enough to deal with the rebounding issues...but if those shots aren't falling as frequently as they have in the past, now there's a legitimate problem.
Rook_217::Get up off this board and call emergency services immediately!!!!
venom47891::dont use bathsalts.
Aarush606::Heat have the worst bench in the league where was Ray Allen.
punxway::so many people predicted that the bulls would easily beat the heat.
SuperDooperPartyPooper::Let's go Bears! ...oh wait!
SuperDooperPartyPooper::Go CBulls!
raggy8292::lebron. only player who can have 16 ft's and only finish with 14 shots
Dem_Canes_Man::Tough season Heat.....lost the ship last night! Better luck next year Miami.
Le Asterisk::One and Done!
Aarush606::Dwade has definitely lost a step not the same player. Lost touch on his jumper Bulls will take advantage of this and more attention on  Lebron leading to a W for the Bulls.
Dem_Canes_Man::It's over Bulls eliminated Miami last night.
Le Asterisk::FACT
Joey White25::THis just goes to show how overrated Drose is to this team.  Year after Rose is out his team is beating the NBA champions.  A year after Lebron leaves Cleveland they have the worst record in the league.  Give back the MVP award Drose!
Beanslams46::Bulls serving up justice. BULLS &gt; HEAT
Aarush606::The Bulls have the best passing big in the game in Noah Bosh is a flopping fake big.
Joey White25::Hey someone tell this guys this is 2013 not 1998.  Get real buddy the Heat will stomp the Bulls if they even make the playoffs.
DrewC399::It is indeed 2013, which is also not 2012. Add Rose to this team and add the Bulls to a growing list of teams who could knock the Heat out of the playoffs.
Bevente::The heat are beatable.  They just lost to my bulls in miami, without derrick rose playing, and lebum shooting 16 free-throws.  Their kryptonite is clearly size.  As long as teams use their big men, they can beat the heat on any given night.  I couldn't help but chuckle after butler drew an offensive foul on wade and wade complained to the refs (like always) and said "that was a flop".  Seriously wade?  If you want to talk about flops, look at your princess teammate that flew himself into coach thibs after someone ON HIS OWN TEAM ran into him.
Joey White25::You meant to say Champion Heat.
Beanslams46::Bulls outrebounded the midget heat 48-28
Aarush606::Heat stadium was half empty Bulls fans always show up.
Aarush606::Who won that series.
Joey White25::Is that true?  Please youtube dwade's finals performance he had vs Dallas.  Then you can just erase what you wrote.
DrewC399::Keep in mind the streets of Chicago gave you Wade. And he has lost a step.
Joey White25::You guys must be bulls fans.  I'm sorry you Brandon Roy as your star but don't be a hater.
Aarush606::Wade can't shoot for his life.
Aarush606::Heat suck.
Beanslams46::Heat fans are tired of watching the Cheat.
Aarush606::Heat are 0 and 3 against the Bulls and Knicks and the rebound differential goes in the Bulls and the Knicks in a huge differential. The heat can't with the best. # ChicagoBulls
Aarush606::Lebron almost didn't play because of his knees.
Aarush606::Lebron = 4th quarter losses.
Joey White25::Brandon Roy's career is over man, bad knees at a young age is not good.
Aarush606::I'm a Bulls fan once we get Drose back we can beat the Heat in any facet of the game.
Joey White25::Please buddy you must be from New York.  You don't even know what it's like to win a playoff series.  Every team in the NBA has more playoff wins than the Knicks over the past year.  No chance son, the Heat will destroy both these teams.
Beanslams46::Once again the officials TRY to hand a heat victory by sending lebron to the line on undeserved fouls more times than Bull's starters combined. Nice try, but no cigar.
chicagogary13::LeBum loses...hahahahahaha lets hope for a torn acl
Joey White25::Hey just because you have the second coming of Brandon Roy out with a blown out ACL doesn't mean you gotta be a hater.  Clearly you're upset because your team will never be good in the next 5 years.
Le Asterisk::Roy never tore his ACL
Rmnski527::How many points did Rony Seikaly score last night?  - bandwagon Heat fan
cheapinitreal::do you even think they have any idea who he is?
Lpnumber01::Anyone see Lebron flop like a monkey into the bench? What a $@%!$@.  Why do you people like King Flop so much?
godfather67898@gmail.com::and they gave hinrich that foul that was obviously mario chalmers that ran into lebron
BALL_DONT_LIE_KNICKS::a true insult to pro athletes, flopping around like a fish that's been hit by an amoeba
trunkmonkey1980::Seems like the biggest different at least statwise when it comes to rebounds is Udonis Haslem.  He's rebounding just a little over half of what he was getting last year.
Beanslams46::Heat were outrebounded 48 to 28
tmoneyinmphs::After that brick in the last seconds, i can see why lebron often passes when a big shot needs to be made.
FoxKat93::big red 25  Why is there so many heat fans now???? Well, probably the reason there were so many Bulls fans in the 90's.. Good enough answer for you?? ====== The Bulls have been top ten in attendance for almost 30 years. This was even after Jordan left and before Rose came. Even during the Lakers 3 peat, I believe the Bulls had better attendance and they were atrocious. After the Heat won in 2006, they were 15th in attendance, so no, it is not the same. Chicago has a better fanbase than Miami. Those are LBJ fans.
Joey White25::Who gives a hoot, you guys have a lot of fans.  blah, blah, blah, your City likes basketball because you had Michael Jordan the greatest basketball player of all time.  Just say that and save us the paragraph you just wrote.
-Lalabye-::I'm 20 and lived in chicago for 20 years , and loved the bulls since I was 5... Our attendance is so great its almost impossible to find tickets for games... Only been to one twice... its almost impossible
9balla::What was total for pts contributed by the bench?  Like 14pts?  Miami's bench sucks Donkey Dickkkkkkk.  I don't care what superstars you have on the team and how many pts they put up but 14pts isn't going to win ball games.  Their bench is just PATHETIC!
Joey White25::You guys might have a rock inside your head.  Lebron and the heat are going to dominate in the playoffs just like they did last year.
tmoneyinmphs::Anyone who plays with lebron has their numbers go down.  Check the stats.
cheapinitreal::Thats why d wade likes playing with him.  He needs someone to make him look good and make you think he is not broken down

cheapinitreal::lol how quickly we forget
stuckerm::okc and clippers are better than miami. even with a semi-healthy derrick rose, the bulls might get past the heat this year.
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::Heat fans can't even fill up the arena for a prime time game. The seats were half empty. So weak to be a fake heat fan . How sad is it to be the proud owners of the quietest arena in the league??!    Lol YOU DUMB HEAT FANS HAVE NO ARGUMENT. It's a fact that the heat suck.

Joey White25::richardsteph88 - You obviously didn't watch basketball before 2010  Not even sure what you mean by watch basketball before 2010. Are you defending when Blowbe Bryant had Shaq?  That was Shaq's team.

stuckerm::lebron is funny? he is one of the most unarticulate and annoying players in the game. have you watched any of his goofy commercials? lebron = clown
Joey White25::stuckerm - lebron is funny? he is one of the most unarticulate and annoying players in the game. have you watched any of his goofy commercials? lebron = clown  Sounds like a hater. Get real you loser, change the channel next time.

big red 25::The Nba doesnt grab my attention like it used to.  It don't even get excited to watch the NBA like I used to.  Used to love seeing the brawls, drama, and heated rivalries.  Now you get nothing.  I enjoy watching basketball just never been devoted to 1 team, because I enjoy watching the slams and talent more than teams themselves. Football I'm a dedicated browns fan, so dont have much to cheer for there, and I love the buckeyes. I will agree alot of people watch Miami now because of Lebron, and Im one of those people.
oblique15::You will fit right in with the rest of the Heat fans Most of them don`t watch bascketball
HEAT_PLANE_NATION32.2::WELCOME TA DA HEAT  PLANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ALL ABOARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
big red 25::hey cant help it basketball sucks other than a few players.
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::Big red and bball fan....  I am glad that you guys understand why everyone hates on the heat fanbase.     Now the funny thing is lebron is exactly the mirror image of a heat fan .  Leves when things aren't going his way to another team that is really good.   Also lebrons true self shows when he has like 5 or six favorite teams for football and baseball.   No loyalty and Arent true to themselves. Fake defines y'all
big red 25::The NBA is the only sport where I dont watch a particular team.  Just like watching talented players.  Im a dedicated browns, buckeyes, and reds fan, but never liked watching basketball much unless it was a great player
big red 25::Why is there so many heat fans now????  Well, probably the reason there were so many Bulls fans in the 90's..  Good enough answer for you??
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::That's why everyone laughs at heat fans.  They don't even know themselves yet on what it means to be a fan .
Bball fan 23::We were still selling out n leading the league in attendance b4 rose came n our team sucked. So don't u even try to compare us to heat fans.
Bball fan 23::Wat the he.ll r u talking bout? Any bulls fans in the 90s tat switched to the heat rnt bulls fans or even heat fans. Those r bandwagoners.
big red 25::I'm not Im just saying when Jordan played 50% of america was a bulls fan.  Wasnt saying you had a bad fan base.   Yes Miami's fans do suck.  All the florida team in all sports have quiet dull fans.
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::Dude you guys said you were bulls fans in the 90s then changed to the heat!! What are you talking about,?
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::Thanks for being honest.  Real fans and real people that aren't fake DON'T CHANGE TEAMS.  So you start losing and decide mmmm I think I will become a fan of whoever is on top???  You have to be  better than that, at least for your children.
big red 25::I'm not a huge NBA fan, never have been.  I'll be honest I usually only watch talented players.  I followed Lebron since high school, so I will always be a fan of whoever he is on. Now NFL and college sports I'm very dedicated to one team
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::Seriously please can someone answer my question about how one becomes a 1-2 year fan? Here is my full question again..   Question .. How can one be a fan of the heat for 1-2 years???    Why aren't you a fan for the team you grew up with??? How do you change your team after all those years????    That's a major sin. It's like a Christian changing religions to become a Muslim.    Real talk.
Djuki 3::Fact: Miami plays all of their opponents high on meth and acid to even the playing field
Pspillane97::Your a $@%!$@%... Your intention was to make it look like the heat is better then all.... But your joke really !$@%!$ up. Meth Is a stimulant, and it would GREATLY enhance your focus in a game, not make you delusional like your trying to point out. Your one dumb @%!$@%! heat fan
HEAT_PLANE_NATION32.2::U REMIND ME OF A DORKY TITO ORTIZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::Question .. How can one be a fan of the heat for 1-2 years???  Why aren't you a fan for the team you grew up with??? How do you change your team after all those years????  That's a major sin.   It's like a Christian changing religions to become a Muslim.  Real talk.
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::Warriors fan for 28 years FA.ggot.  I did slap my balls on your mom though 1 year heat fan.
big red 25::Your obviously a Lebron fan from cleveland...... How can you stop scratching the nuts you scratched for 7 years and then scratch someone else's because he left your team????
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::HAHA SO true!!
Heat_Master_Sage::How do you know people haven't been fans of miami for years?
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::They all admit it like they are proud to say it. That's how.  Don't say it's not.
oblique15::cause you never heard them before Lebron
NYballer6969::Looks like the Bulls can do just fine w/o Rose (Like last year ) this year they lost their whole 2nd team and still beat Miami in Miami...Much respect ...I felt all along that Thibs is the true MVP on this team . The Bulls D is relentless no matter how many pcs. they are missing !
papijavi2536::normally i dont like boozer but he was ballin last nite, wish he could be aggresive like that more often
Road dog Red::Lebron is DUE to break down.. Two Finals in a row...and the Olympics... its going to happen SOON and then this board will be emptier than their freaking arena...
oneandonlybabe::Nope probably fuller with those who will rejoice in his break down....
Djuki 3::wrong board bro, all Celtics fans are on the Obscurity boards with Lakers fans :)
big red 25::If you mean Paul Peirce slow, he might get there by age 45
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::big red 25 - If you mean Paul Peirce slow, he might get there by age 45  Dude lebron looks old and broken down. He already gives up mentally
big red 25::POWER RANKINGS FOR DUMBEST POSTER  1.  Lebron.cant.close.out.again 2. " 3. " I look for you to repeat next year as dumbest poster again.
ferretluvah2::CHI (with a healthy Rose) is among of handful of teams that could beat MIA in a series.
Bball fan 23::How did they handle them pretty easily? Other than when the bulls blew Miami out the first game of the series, every single game after tat was won by the last one or two possessions.
big red 25::I dont believe so Miami will take it up 3 notches when the playoffs come around.  They handled chicago with drose pretty easy before.
ferretluvah2::..could.  ..didn't say will.
oneandonlybabe::True And here is hoping Rose comes back healthy and ready to go
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::Miami is old, slow, boring,  anything but clutch .  Hey when the queen leaves Miami to find another team what will you do???  Lebron won't have any more than 1/2 championship and a legacy of being the biggest 4th quarter choker ever.
Lebron.cant.close.out.again::U can borrow some from RUPAL bosh
Djuki 3::Vagisil helps manage your feminine odor itching :)
oneandonlybabe::The regular season is a marathon, not a sprint and since Lebron already does so much, Wade has his knees issues and Bosh is not the most physical player out there, they're probably better off pacing themselves for later.
Heat_Master_Sage::No lebron can't, you have never posted a fact in your life.   In fact, I  know you're a troll!
oneandonlybabe::If only he enjoyed his own trolling you know? He just sounds so upset and desperate that he may do something drastic at some point.
