jimmyclams::HEAT @ CELTICS monday night hope they keep the streak, Ray Allen returning with a hot team I'd love a box seat. KG snubbing ray his attitude is petite, falsetto and conceit. DOWN GOES GARNETT, DOWN GOES GARNETT in defeat..
jimmyclams::HEAT VS CELTS
jimmyclams::gonna be a dogfight on monday nite. KG's last game of the season, cause he'd die before he lets Ray Allen walk outta there with a win...
Wade beat your best player... u r here cause u HATE the Heat::if the streak will end.... Celtics or Spurs will be the ones
.KB24.::I think those are the games they are least likely to lose.  Those are the ones that Miami will be most up to play.  I think it will be a more sneaky team that does it.
Wade beat your best player... u r here cause u HATE the Heat::With or without Gasol...    With or without Kobe...  Ever stopped to consider the fact that no matter what combo makes the Lakers a better team, they will still lose to LeBron and Wade ?  and that this is why you post stats about the PAST...  LOL... its only funny cause... You Know It's True   ; )
Mambaholic 33::REMEMBER, THESE R GUYS THAT SAID: Lebron - will never win ring.....Wrong! Lebron - will never be clutch.....Wrong! Wade - will never get back to himself....Wrong! Lebron - has played with as much talent as Kobrick....Wrong! Slam your head 3 times in frig door - call a doctor! Fakers - will be the best Team NBA ...WRONG! Kobrick - is clutch....Wrong! Lebron - to "SLOW"....Wrong!  Seek a new doctor! Rodman - shut down Shaq....WRONG! TIME TO FIND A NEW SPORT!!!

KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::LOL.... How many Kobe had? Including coaching?
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::And one could also draw from your posts that you are saying Kobe is better than Mj because MJ had more HOF teammates?????
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::SO alot of players had HOF teammates. Why didn't they all win?
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::What does that have to do with Phil Jackson? And if you want to use that as a point then the point that Lebron has HOF teammates is moot...  Dummy
loblaws991::shaq thats IT.
loblaws991::including coach? thats cheap shot lmao. Donnie Nelson was HOF .....jerry sloan was HOF...tell me how many rings stockton won ...ill wait
Rocketswin2013::Dennis Rodman would destroy Lebron. He'd leave him in tears. Rodman at 225 shutdown Shaq who was 300 pounds in the 96' ECF. And i mean Shaq couldn't back down Rodman one inch. Lebron couldn't score on basket on Dennis. That's why Miami and the Bulls don't compare. Just like how MJ is superior to LBJ.
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::Rodman did not and could not shut down Shaq
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::Check again. The internet is a useful tool. Use it before you look foolish next time.

KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::Yes I can/ Kobe is too Selfish and not efficient
loblaws991::nobody knows that,. and you cant prove it LMAO
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::Kobe and wade would not work. Kobe with Wade and Ray would not work..  Next?
loblaws991::we can play what ifs all day, if kobe had wade and ray allen what if? if kobe had been with shaq what if? stop with the what ifs could haves
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::I think you need to ask yourself that question. Kobe's team's and coaching was WAY better than Lebron's. If lebron would have had the coaching staff and the team of the lakers? Think about it
loblaws991::can YOU read?
loblaws991::no wtf im talking about 7 year hiatus from greatness kobe had to deal with to the point where he had to request a trade.
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::What??? You must be slow. Kobe's team's in 95-2003 were better than ANYTHING lebron had in Cleveland
loblaws991::whatever team lebron had was ten times better then kobes. people need to marvel at the lakers almost beating the stacked suns as a lower seed with a buncha bums like walton
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::Ok, but you put 04. in 04 they had the squad. And Lebron had nobodies too. jamison was not there for all the years Lebron was
loblaws991::after 04 burnout. what dont i know? the team blew up after 04....
loblaws991::Kobe playing with shaq whos HOF thats it. Pau gasol and Bynum dont count as HOF i think the correct term is ALL STARS
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::How many Hof's are on the Heat?
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::Ok, I bet Fisher makes the HOF. I bet Horry makes the HOF.  Kobe had a HOF coach
Rocketswin2013::BUT STILL what he did at those other teams GOT HIM IN THE HOF. You said he's not a HOF pllayer and he IS.
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::LOL you are funny. I said nothing about his value. I am saying he is performing as a bench player.  He is not the player he was in Milwaukee/Seattle/Boston(early on)
Rocketswin2013::Look up what he did when he was young you stupid clown. Ray Allen was a 25ppg stud. And scored 20ppg on that 08's title squad.
loblaws991::obviously you dont know the value in having RAY ALLEN ( a starter on celtics) come of the BENCH.
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::lol, are you sure you can read? I said he is not performing at a HOF level. He is a bench player right now
loblaws991::please.....please.....tactically hes an asset off the bench and hes hit game winners that have bailed out the heat this year. plus when they double wade or lebron he hits 3s. if you dont think you need him by all means release him or trade him come the offseason
digimon.emperor::allen is going to the hall of fame
KOBRICK IS A WATERED DOWN REPLICA OF MJ::Ray allen? He is not contributing at a HOF level right now.

loblaws991::horribleness? look at the lakers season so many injuries.
kaharevic::Where does Wade rank in top SG all time?
loblaws991::behind kobe. until he gets league MVP and passes kobes ring count and 1st team appearances and defensive appearances its gonna be tough to put him ahead
GBE 300 bang.bang::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhpVE5Yfvhc lebron had 2 bronze medals until kobe joined the team and won a gold for him, with this beautiful clutch performance against spain. what a great night that was.

81becca90210::When people  say who would give the HEAT a hard time in the NBA finals 7 game series it's the spurs  Spurs would win   Duncan  Parker Manu Bonner

Yup I am here.::loblaws I am talking about Kobe's ability. i am saying that at his level then he would not have been able to go IF there was
loblaws991::the olympics were not held that year smh
GBE 300 bang.bang::lol  he couldnt win untill kobe joined. FACT
kaharevic::The reason I would take Lebron over Kobe s because of his unselfshiness, he looks to pass the ball, he wants to be a team player. Kobe has had more of a will to win. That's why I like Kobe, his will to win. But I would take Lebron over Kobe. My opinion.
loblaws991::kobe ahs more career asisst than jordan and this season is averaging 5.8 As
Yup I am here.::Who said huge. You said Kobe had more. That's misleading.  MJ had more. MJ averaged 8 in a season.  Kobe do that?

digimon.emperor::we still havent seen all of lebron's prime
loblaws991::even as a heat fan i dislike the kobe doesnt pass. i guess season average of 5.8 assists means he doesnt pass and career average of 5 assists supports his ballhoggisness and having more career assists than jordan
Yup I am here.::Lakers in 94-95=48 wins  In 95-96 they won 53 games while kobe rode the bench averaging 7. Kobe didn't average over 20 until his 4th year.
brandonlee561heat22::He isn't regarded as one of the best sidekick's of all time for nothing.

loblaws991::kobe a sidekick? please thats like me saying lebron ios a sidekick
loblaws991::cause they had superior SG talent that makes no sense
Yup I am here.::So? Kobe was the starter in his 3rd year. He was still not an efficient guard
loblaws991::no wtf eddie jones and van excel were already there
Yup I am here.::No, it is because Kobe was not as ready as Lebron. Kobe was the starter in 2 years and still but up ok numbers

If I want to have fun, I pick Lebron  -Bird   I played with Kobe and Lebron. Kobe is better   -Shaq   Kobe is the greatest Laker of all time  -Magic, Jerry West    Lebron is the best player off all time better then Jordan  -12 year old Lebron fanboys
