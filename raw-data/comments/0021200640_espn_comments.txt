EKast2012::AP recap says: "Durant... said he hopes the situation works out well for both West Coast cities."  Uh... It's a zero-sum competition.  Either Sacramento keeps the franchise or Seattle gets it.
BYUsGotHeart::Is the Jimmer free yet??
Flying High Birman::Lakers are a joke
1419892::go OKC
sean8567::ok
_Blue...::see?
BavarianM3::pretty solid game. KD was a PG, he didn't want to take any shots.
zeroway21::I thought the Thunder were playing the LA Kings for a split moment.
StankyChickin::Like rolling past the Kings is SOOOOO hard to do lol
RimmersForJimmer::Get the Kings out of Sacramento already.  Purge all management, and start from scratch.  Maybe then Fredette will be utilized in the correct capacity.  Though, I think the Kings should move to St. Louis instead.  Seattle already head their chance at an NBA team and blew it.
adam83stl::Not at all.  Plus we lost the hawks to Atlanta so its not like it hasn't happened here before  either
adam83stl::I don't think an NBA team would do well in st Louis
DatGuy8921::Not really a bball town.
sean8567::lakers
Jordan tha GOAT::Go back on the Fakers board. ...I seen your corny behind on there all happy because yall beat the Jazz.....get the hell out of here....how many games is your corny team under .500
sean8567::ok
bucksnreds::Recent headlines on ESPN:  - Muhammed has a Gucci backpack  - Welker's girlfriend does not like Suggs and Lewis  - Manti Teo's GF is a man  - Dwight Howard does not like negativity   - JaMarcus Russell lost 12 pounds in 2 years and now weighs 308 lbs   WTf?
adam83stl::You forgot the one about bbc queen Kim Kardashians divorce not going quick enough
Ozzie el maestro::go to bed junkie
chris4624::BS sells as we can clearly see! SMH
laynestaleys07::I HATE it when my Kings lose!!  - Seattle residents
35mikey1313::OKC could be even better, maybe on the level of Miami, if they would get rid of Perkins from their starting lineup. He is just terrible
mbarcl::Best center they have had, and he fits what they do. They are still a very young team. Their time will come. Youngest team to make the finals. Think you should let the professionals stick to what they do and go back to your recliner and cheetos.
Ozzie el maestro::turrrible (charles barkley voice)
phlyglesfan::Thunder beat the Kings LOL slow sports news day, i see
blackdevilace::Former Sonics beat the soon to be Sonics Lol
ZRatedLT4::I find it funny when whiners $@%!$ about "KD gets all the calls" etc.... look at the star players for any team.....and look at how many shots they take..... yep...it's not rocket science.... they get the ball a lot more....hence more calls. It's not a conspiracy...it's common sense....
mbarcl::You try and guard a guy who is 6'10 and can move like that. They have to foul him. They can't guard him.
Judge Smails.::There is absolutely something to that, but superstar calls do exist, and Durant does get his share of them.  Last week he became the first guy to shoot 20+ FT's in back to back games since teams were intentionally fouling Shaq.  On several "fouls" he wasn't touched.
DStacks713::Lol One time i saw Lebron shove a dude, and the refs called the foul on the dude. hahahah he was like "what the f did i do???"
noble sheeter::if you are taking shots with defense on you and missing why are they rewarded with freethrows or has d.rose and deng been getting cheated? which one is it? and we got the defense to prove it! we dont give up the HUncho to just any team with the nba logo!the bulls
Kaultar::You have to scream like a girl or it doesn't get called.
noble sheeter::good record thunder, but not quite as good as 72-10 or even 32-7 D&gt;Rose 2012 bulls but it'll do i guess for a up and relocated organization i guess? i wonder how much swag or what ever that deng or boozer would [lay with offensively if they thought it was erven remotely possible they would go to the frontline 20 times or more and still shoot below 50% \ matter of fact i thought that the and one whistle was incorpoprated form players like jordan and rose and even baby bron bron when he was with the cav'z) showing strength skill and ability to finish despite the contact , and  not flopping and throwing hands in the air in the direction of refs
roadglider2011::Best record in the NBA, I guess it's all a fluke?
YRndMadness::I wish I could flag dumb comments.
35mikey1313::Jealousy is ok. Get out of the past. Bulls are not that good
Westjag::I tell you crazy s**t happens during full moons. What are the odds Both Kobe &amp; my boy Russ each have14 assists, season highs the SAME night
JRayner062867::Gratuitous:  Sonics past over Sonics future.  Love them both.  Sac gets another team, no worries.
dj_aj2006::Yorke44, I'm pretty sure Hansen and company can top their first offer, which they will
StankyChickin::Umm Yorke44, The team is sold to Hansen.. How is anyone else going to purchase it unless the NBA denies the sale? That still doesn't guarantee 100% that the Maloofs will sell to local ownership.
yorke44::o u didnt hear? lol americas 3rd richest person, scott carlsen, worth over $41 billion dollars is in on the deal now....sorry seattle no soup 4 u!!!!
remy 88::How do you see Sac get another team?
yorke44::theyre keeping the kings http://www.sacbee.com/2013/01/24/5138478/limited-partners-have-first-right.html
yorke44::http://www.sacbee.com/2013/01/24/5138478/limited-partners-have-first-right.html
remy 88::Well, I think everybody assumed when the Sonics left town that when the city got their shi.t together, the NBA would come come back to Seattle sooner than later, but who knows how long until Sacramento gets a team back. That's a shame.
For Petes Sake 2.0::Some fans seem to be jumping the gun huh.  NBA still has to approve.
remy 88::Thunder fans: rank the potential first round matchup from least favorable to most favorable  Denver Utah Houston Portland LAL Dallas
roadglider2011::Who cares, bring it on!
Westjag::Houston Utah Portland LA Dallas Denver.... We have Houstons # this year. They can't beat us without Harden and he just doesn't fare well against his former team. LA is still going to give someone fits because if they get the seventh or eighth spot then all of sudden Kobe starts to believe and those stars wake up. As for Dallas and Denver always gotta have respect.
Inframzah::With exception of Denver and Utah, they are all Sweeps.
remy 88::btw, the Twolves are in the mix there, but there on such a tragic downward trajectory, that I'm assuming they be in last place by the end of the season.
big145fly::Utah, Portland, Denver, LAL, Dallas, Houston
remy 88::I'd probably switch Denver and Portland with you
ggfdsgsfg6062::fsdjfsd
For Petes Sake 2.0::I agree!!!
remy 88::You know, for a while the Thunder looked less than interested in this game. Russ just took over. He was amazing. And Thabo and Kmart were superstars tonight.
35mikey1313::Unoriginal. There's Lebrick and Kobrick too. Funny how jealousy causes people to hate on the best players. 7-18 not bad. LBJ was 9-14 last night and DWade 12-20 and everyone knows what Kobe did. Why can't people enjoy the great ones?
Westjag::Hey  Erik, you secretly have a crush on Russ huh? Cute nickname you gave him. Hater.
Erik76290::Ya 7-18 for westBrick. Just amazing
roadglider2011::13 assists?
kcruskin::The old Seattle Sonics beat the new Seattle Sonics.
kcruskin::Haha. Just got on and didnt see any a few down so thought I might be the first.....I won't be on long enough to see a million though, I need to go back to work in a couple minutes.
Maniacpkt::wow, i think i've seen this type of post for the millionth time tonight
For Petes Sake 2.0::Originality doesn't really exist in the world of trolls.
TFUID ELEVEN::Good night, and THUNDER THE F-CK UP!
Bevonator69::35-10!
Maniacpkt::night dude, see ya sunday
TFUID ELEVEN::In 2008, Kevin Martin scored 23.7 points per game with Sacramento. In 2009, he scored 24.6.  He's always had the ability. He'll never be a good defender but he can hit open shots and score on his own as well. he's been one of the most underrated scorers in the game for many years.  I want him to stay longer. But not too long, because Lamb has a lot of potential.
remy 88::I like the guy. He says he's happier where he's at now than he's been in a long time in his career..
Maniacpkt::he is deliriously happy here, so i hope he signs for cheap on a 3 year deal
Neil826::the supersonics couldnt lose this game.
For Petes Sake 2.0::Weak weak weak trolling.
Bevonator69::I feel like K-Mart advanced his game tonight. The guy is really stepping up.
Judge Smails.::Kenyon Martin is K-Mart, Kevin needs a new nickname.
ThunderHornz::SUPER-KMART
remy 88::he's putting together a good stretch of games after a mini-slump. I'm proud of him.
gorillaplus2000::He hasn't been very consistent on the road, but has been looking better lately.
Maniacpkt::he goes through streaks, albeit no where near as streaky as cook was
remy 88::Kmart looks kinda like Bert
35mikey1313::Weirdest looking shot in the league. Can't figure out how he's so successful with it
Maniacpkt::he looks like Thabo to me
remy 88::brothas from a different continent.
MafiosoSpaghetti::no over? cocksuckers okc and sac
TFUID ELEVEN::Well, OKC goes to 35-10 on Sunday.  Can't wait to watch that one.
Elektrolysis::Lately it's been a drubbing each time the Thunder play them.
Maniacpkt::should be a good game, always is when we play the lakers
TFUID ELEVEN::Will Sacramento ever get a team back after the Kings leave?
SMS4Hou::Nope, and with all those empty seats and the thunder in town, they don't deserve one either.
jecdev1::yeah 15,000 +
remy 88::unfortunately, probably not for a long @ss time. I wish a different team would go to Seattle.
Maniacpkt::i did hear a Billionaire was really interested in buying the team and keeping it in Sac
Maniacpkt::probably not for a long, long time
joest2003::dont kno or care im from CT havnt had $@%! since the Whalers
2002 Sacramento Kings - NBAs best all time team.::Damn. Lakers won. I wanted to troll.
Bevonator69::It didn't stop me. :)
TFUID ELEVEN::Taking loads of shots was implanted in Kobe's brain the moment he picked up a basketball for the first time.  One game does not mean we should expect anything different.  It does mean, though, that we can look forward to watching the greatest bricklayer of all-time go to work on OKC on Sunday.  Expect a lot of bricks out there.
remy 88::24 Durant 24 Kmart 18 Russ 14 Serge 10 Thabo  I love that.
remy 88::27 team assists!
gorillaplus2000::.....Lakers win.....  Police in LA have been alerted to widespread celebrations in the streets that may lead to looting and riots.
Maniacpkt::so...a normal friday night in LA?
Maniacpkt::might as well let them enjoy their win, it's not going to happen a lot this year
gorillaplus2000::Pretty much:)

For Petes Sake 2.0::LA board is gross.  Lotta LA fans thinking OKC loses Sunday.  Geez
gorillaplus2000::They are just losing their minds after one win aren't they :)
For Petes Sake 2.0::I just want to see LA win 2 in a row.
2002 Sacramento Kings - NBAs best all time team.::LOL @ This guy defending Cousins. The Kings actually have pretty good talent surrounding Cousins..... The problem is the players personalities. All fat thugs that refuse to work together and refuse to play hard. Cousins is a cancer and a shi.t player.
BleedsUKBlue::You don't know anything about NBA talent if you think Cousins is surrounded by "pretty good talent"  Cousins is probably the only King who would start for any playoff team in the league. Reke is a position-less 6th man without a jump shot.
remy 88::Russ &gt; CP3
35mikey1313::Come on now don't get carried away
Maniacpkt::Remember when the thunder had Nenad Krstic as a starting center?  yeah, be happy we have perkins
SMS4Hou::How many rings does Perkins have?
Judge Smails.::You don't think the Celtics could have won that with Krstic instead?
Maniacpkt::he wasn't bad, but he wasn't good
CliffSmith25::This is exactly how I'd describe perkins.  How much did Nenad get paid?
TFUID ELEVEN::Krstic was not a bad player. He could at least hit an open layup.
Strike 1 yer OUT::Nenad was decent. Mid range, boxed out well
For Petes Sake 2.0::MotorCityMagic just got OWNED.

35mikey1313::Durant is ONLY a scorer. That's his whole game. The media may give him the MVP but he's half the player LBJ is, that's been proven
DStacks713::he can say whatever, but Kobe still not better than Durant
treedoc40::I don’t think Calipari finished the job getting Cousins NBA ready.
35mikey1313::He's talking just to talk. He has to know that is a stupid statement. More hating. On the Kings? SMH that's sick
BleedsUKBlue::can't argue with 18 &amp; 10 on a $@%!$@ team, some people don't take to losing 3 nights a week as well as others.
TFUID ELEVEN::Cal is a great recruiter. But much overrated as a coach.
BleedsUKBlue::I didn't know he was jewish.
TFUID ELEVEN::That looks painful.
2002 Sacramento Kings - NBAs best all time team.::lol
MotorCityMagic35::Kevin Durant: one 10+ assist game in 6 yrs  Kobe: Last 6yrs, 20 total 10+ assist games  So who doesn't pass the ball now??
Michael22759::Kevin Durant. 3 Straight scoring titles. Kobe Bryant 2 all career. See? I can make pointless statements too.
remy 88::Durant is a forward. Kobe is a guard. Idiot.
TFUID ELEVEN::Durant takes less shots.
gorillaplus2000::More efficient shooter, and his assists are way up this year.
2002 Sacramento Kings - NBAs best all time team.::Jimmer &gt; Cousins
BleedsUKBlue::It's about time you posted something funny. Thanks for the laugh.
MotorCityMagic35::People rip on Kobe for not passing it enough. Last 6yrs, Kobe has 19 more 10 assist games and 45 more 8+assist games than Kevin Durant
35mikey1313::Kobe is a better player than Durant career wise you can't compare them now. When Kobe was 23 he was way better than Durant now
DStacks713::say what you wanna say, but he's still not better than KD
remy 88::he plays in the god damn back court with Pau Gasol.
35mikey1313::Gasoline is a guard? Interesting. Do you watch basketball or just try to anger people with ludicrous statements
2002 Sacramento Kings - NBAs best all time team.::Cousins is a loser.
TFUID ELEVEN::Cousins just has some major growing up to do.  The Kings in particular just have horrible chemistry.
BleedsUKBlue::The Kings are definitely losers, nearly the worst West team every season.
