UMfanforlife24::I'd rather have Kevin Durant on my team over Kobe Bryant anyday.. already. Kevins only averaging less than a point a game than Kobe and hes shooting 50 percent compared to Kobes 43.. plus bigger, better rebounder and less selfish.. I would still take Lebron over either of them but Kevin Durant is whos chasing Lebron.. Not Kobe. I would love to see a finals of the Thunder and Heat, because I love both players, not to mention wade and westbrook, ibaka and bosh, and james harden.
AndySportsB::THUNDERup!!!
aise5668::With Derek Fisher missing due to his trade and Boris Diaw missing a few games a couple of weeks ago, Russell Westbrook is the league leader in consecutive games played at  291.  He's never missed a game in his career.  He's very tough, give him credit.
dkbiggs81::he is also the league leader in shot attempts and missing.. in other words.. ball hoggin.
Qzhoopin72::I agree...Russell is a tough dude. He gets knocked to the floor every game on one of those 100mph drives to the rim, but always bounces right up without acting a baby about the contact.
aise5668::Well, he always bounces back up but sometimes he does act like a baby about it.  The guy is a phenom but he needs to improve about understanding the times that you complain to the refs and the times that you don't.  He's getting better every day and he's gotten better in this area, too but there is still room for improvement.
LSD_hookem::Nice win Thunder!  For the record I did not follow the sonics except to keep up with Durant- like I check on DJ Augustin, Aldridge, Joseph, Thompson,etc- all former UT players. I was a Mavs fan but grew to disrespect and dislike the org. Lived in Dallas, Houston, and currently Edmond. Supported Hornets when they were here and caught a bad case of Thunder fever- absolute fan!  For the record- I had nothing to do with Seattle losing their team!! Better cities than Seattle have lost their sports teams and it stinks for the fans but just grow up Seattle- Thunder fans have no guilt in your loss- just joy at getting your team and making it relevant again.
help.crew::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGpJ4zF_ypE should go to portland
help.crew::damn poor portland.. ima just go play this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp__kgtqiyA
dddevin69::alot of the forner osu players won't adimt it, but the osu freshman class of 1999 were all interested in going to ou except for Rashaun woods.  but when coach blake got fired....they thought it was racist of ou to do so.  it didnt matter than blake had consecutive horrible seasons.   i told them that ou would be back.  they didn't believe me.  then ou won the natl ship 2 year later...LOL
aise5668::Oh, yeah, I read that in the early 1900's there was a ship that they claimed god couldn't even sink.  Well, on it's maiden voyage, the ship didn't make it.  It sank costing hundreds of people their lives.  That ship was called the Titanic.    I figured this was the ancient history that nobody cares about thread so I posted this little diddy here.
ChilamBilam12::alright boys.. enjoy the night, i'm crashing out.. Thunder Up!
dddevin69::later
ChilamBilam12::Tuesday buddy, bring on the Jazz
RollThunder35::Me too.  gotta get SOME sleep.  Til Tuesday!!!
RollThunder35::Guess thats been my addiction, girls.
dddevin69::same here
dddevin69::heck, i used to teach former osu wideout rashaun woods and elbert craig when they were at millwood h.s.      Elbert was cool.  but rashaun was dumb as HELL.  his principal at the time BOBBY UPSHAW asked the teachers to type his papers for him.   he didn't ask that for any other student.
RollThunder35::wow
dddevin69::i met former ou coach John blake once.  He was a cocky arrogant sob.   he didn't know **** about leading a major college program
ChilamBilam12::in all honesty, so is Coach Gundy from OSU.. hell he stiffed my sister on a $200 tab at a restaurant she worked for.. said he was a huge dick the entire meal
RollThunder35::ouch, we all cant be perfect all the time
RollThunder35::truth.
dddevin69::skybar  in downtown okc.  never been. but heard of it though
seattlemarinersnumber1::cluster-fck for cowboys and $@%!$@
ChilamBilam12::sounds like a good enough reason, lol
RollThunder35::p.u.s.s.y.
RollThunder35::half korean,  she was a freak.  loved that $@%!$
RollThunder35::its a dou.che bar.  just went there cuz the chick i was banging wanted to go.
dddevin69::there are plenty of stripclubs in okc (I can't say who they are) where one can buy and smoke drugs all day long.  and get a lap dance afterwards.  heck one used to offer crack and a lapdance at the same time.    "happy ending" lap dances
ChilamBilam12::ha, that is true of just about any major cities though.. in my travels you kind of get a feel that if you ask the right questions in a place like that anywhere you can usually find just about anything you are looking for
dddevin69::rollthunder, so were u a friend of Birdman?
RollThunder35::no, just hanging with a girl that was friends with somebody HE was there with.  Got sucked in the group, it was cool though.  Hung out in the VIP and talked to Birdman.  Real cocky from afar, but cool when you just converse with him.
ChilamBilam12::Meth is no different then any other addiction.. hell i'm a recovering alcoholic, and the things alcohol has done to people i know as a "legal" drug can rival anything i've seen out of meth or cocain
ChilamBilam12::AA never really did it for me, but i have seen it change lives and i know it really works magic for some people who need that support system.. i just had to finally say enough was enough and never touched the stuff again or the better of myself.. some people just can't pull that without something like AA backing them up.. it is definitely something i recommend
RollThunder35::truth.
dddevin69::GOOD FOR U                  i go to AA meetings all the time.   they are good for people
dddevin69::derek fishers waffle house incident was at a waffle house in okc
dddevin69::i wonder how many nba players are on hard drugs
dddevin69::i remember when derek fisher was in a waffle house and helped stop a fight.  I wasn't there, it was on the news.
dddevin69::chris "birdman" anderson got a taste of the WRONG side of oklahoma.   that's what he tested positive for.  it was meth. it was when he was with the okc/new orleans hornets
dddevin69::rollthunder.....thanks for not making fun of my previous addiction to crack.  i also dabbled in meth too.  but thank god I recovered.  heck the "birdman" who playws with Denver got lured into smoking meth in oklahoma.  TRUE STORY
ChilamBilam12::holy hell.. i won't say it surprises me, but man
RollThunder35::2  things.  1) my brother in law ruined his life on meth   2)i hung out with Birdman while the Hornets were in OKC and watched him snort coke of a toilet in Skyybar.
RollThunder35::i know right.  watched him drop 5 g's on a waitress at Baker St pub on north side.  I dunno why i was always where Birdman was.  Wierd
dddevin69::WOW
ChilamBilam12::not something to make fun of.. everyone has struggles.. just glad you got out while you could, before it ended you like it has a lot of people in this state
dddevin69::clay bennet promised the seattle supersonics faithful he would NEVER take the team away and even the seattle ownership group rollthunder.  that's why seattle people hate us.  It's like if ur  mom cheated on your dad and married the guy she had an affair with.  U may be too young to remember the affair, but that wouldn't mean that it never happened.  sorry had to use that analogy
RollThunder35::its just not that simple.  would Clay have been in a position to buy if the Sonics were supported well?
ChilamBilam12::I understand the hate.. but hating the Thunder Team, and the Thunder fans for something they had nothing to do with is just a little misplaced.. no member of the team or fan base could have helped what happened in Seattle
RollThunder35::spinderalla= easily hottest S&amp;P member.
RollThunder35::well i thought she was hot.
dddevin69::oh she was hot on tv. i agree
dddevin69::honestly, she wasn't that hot in person.  she looked just like another girl when i saw her around 96.  heck most of the people in the bowing alley didn't even know who she was.  she was just another black girl with a tall black guy as far as they were concearned
dddevin69::honestly, i freely admit that clay bennet and co STOLE the supersonics from the Seattle faithful.  I am ashamed of that.  but it did happen
RollThunder35::he did make it hard for them to keep them once he bought them, but the ball was in thier court on the arena.
RollThunder35::they had chances to keep them and bennett just kinda proved that Seattle Sonics fell to the bottom of the list compared to other sports.
dddevin69::spinderella of the group SALT AND PEPA used to hang out in okc.  in the NW britton rd area.  She used to date current LAMAR coach Kermitt Holmes when he played for the oklahoma bball team.  I forgot the name of that minor league team
Meet Friar Tebow::the myrtle beach mermaids?
Meet Friar Tebow::I'll keep that in mind
RollThunder35::MB is in North Carolina
dddevin69::i used to hang out in jones oklahoma and smoke weed and crack there.  i stopped smoking crack  2 years ago.  that's all people in jones oklahoma liked to do was smoke weed and crack
Meet Friar Tebow::Psh caffeine is a drug as well while were at it
dredubs99::marijuana is not a drug
RollThunder35::ya it is.  still smoke it tho from time to time.  shoot, alcohol is a drug
RollThunder35::my sis and her hubby moved to Jones last year when they got married, hes from Choctaw.  i dunno why they chose Jones.
dddevin69::tell them to be careful.  i used to date a girl there and she got me hooked on drugs.  I was drug fee until i met her. Heck, I never touched a joint or any weed until I as 28.  TRUE STORY
dddevin69::rollthunder...why did u think i was lying about being from oklahoma?  i thought that was a lil funny.
RollThunder35::just thought you were trying to make other OKC fans look silly saying we couldnt beat Miami.
RollThunder35::its not that i dont respect the ring the Sonics won, i just feel we shouldnt claim a ring we didnt earn.  thats all.  i admit Seattle has a ship and worked hard for it.  but OKC didnt earn it.
dddevin69::no, not at all.  i just wanted everyone to be aware of the okc thunder's rich seattle history.  think about it.  okc has a CHAMPIONSHIP.   most franchises can't say that.  atl cant, toronto cant,   even Utah doesn't have a ring.  but the okc thunder does.   YEAAA!!!!          trust me....most laker fans embrace their minn laker history.  they brag those rings as well to keep up with boston celtics fans.
dddevin69::i did like that club tumbleweeds in stillwater.  cool place
ChilamBilam12::he has a friend who rides motocross professionally that lives in Stillwater.. comes in occasionally just to party
ChilamBilam12::once partied with the crew from JackA.s.s there.. it was insane, and i've never seen anyone as drunk as Johnny Knoxville
RollThunder35::Knoxville at the Weed?  whoa
RollThunder35::been there a few times,, calf fry is fun.  lotta cowboys though.
dddevin69::u seem like a cool dude rollthunder.   i wasn't trying to insult you.  I just get frustrated when my fellow oklahoma act like they don't know that most educated nba fans know about the seattle supersonic/okc thunder shared history
ChilamBilam12::we all need to respect what Seattle brought to the team, and most need to understand and appreciate the history.. i would hope any rational NBA fan would get that
RollThunder35::well if thats how other NBA fans think of us, i wont like it, but i'll learn the Sonics history.  just have a sour taste to Sonics after the way Seattle fans still act to us.
ChilamBilam12::sad if that is true.. i went to Oklahoma State in Stillwater, and never heard a true racial slur the entire time i was there that wasn't made as a jest.. hell 90% of the schools athletes are minorities, and i was friends with many of them.. it didn't keep the city and state from pulling just as hard for the teams they played for, and definitely never stirred up any racial issues
ChilamBilam12::any argument is better then those we have been having with the old Seattle faithful.. if i have to hear another sob story about how our team is stolen and how we are not true NBA fans because of it...
dddevin69::at least we all can agree that we mutally like the nba.
RollThunder35::ya,  i just dont see how somebody can be racist.  its so antiquated.  and youre in the minority if you are racist.
dddevin69::i'm an okc thunder fan.  dont' get me wrong rollthunder.  i just honestly believe that both the chicago bulls and miami heat are better.  i just don't see this team winning a title.  not anytime soon if ever with kd and co
RollThunder35::but i hear people say that, and dont explain "why"
dddevin69::because......Lebron + wade = the best duo in the nba as of today.   yeah..i know know..kd and russel score more, but Miami has more EXPERIENCE.  plus like my earlier example....Jordan/pippen,  shaq/kobe,  magic/kareem.... get it?     i guess it will take okc not winning it all this year to make it more apparent
dddevin69::i first got called the N word when I visited stillwater. I was driving with a car full of black people and some guy shouted out racial slurs when i was in stillwater
RollThunder35::hate to tell you man, but that is gonna happen anywhere.  maybe more in the south or midwest.
RollThunder35::i graduated from Stillwater with a few black guys, friends even.  Might look at it as an isolated situation.
RollThunder35::well that sux, cuz Stillwater is my hometown and i love it.  it was likely a drunk frat boy trying to show off for his buds.  Stillwater is a small town man.  but you bring the trash outta the smaller surrounding hick towns and that what happens.
dddevin69::i've never been called the n word to my face anywhere but stillwater.  in okc i guess the rednecks know better.  sorry, not trying to be bitter.  just being honest abou my experiences
dddevin69::i went to high school with officer Chad Perry.  the guy who was assaulted and paralyzed
RollThunder35::remember that, shoot i donated to that
dddevin69::his brother mark Perry was such a ****  in high school
dddevin69::hey...rollthunder?   u remember that recent story of a putnam city school teacher arrested for bankrobbery?
RollThunder35::no but i do about the McCloud teacher emailing kiddie porn to some guy in like Philly or something.
RollThunder35::I remember when channel 5 was "5 Alive"!
dddevin69::exactly
ChilamBilam12::YOU CAN'T BE THE FAN OF A TEAM BEFORE IT EVEN EXISTED!..  by your logic every fan is a bandwagon fan, so long as they were not supporting the franchise it came from prior to its current location.. i can promise you there were very few Laker fans following the team in Min. your logic makes no since
dddevin69::stillwater has got to be the most RACIST town I have ever been in.
ChilamBilam12::says the man who apparently hates the entire state he was born in.. get off the bored bro.. if you are a Thunder fan you are giving us all a bad name
RollThunder35::really?
RollThunder35::you pulling my leg?  its college kids.
RollThunder35::i guess when you bring those names up, i gotta believe.  i remember jerry.
dddevin69::lee evans....former black female newscaster...famous after okc bombing.   r.i.p lee evans
dddevin69::jerry parks....former news broadcaster
dddevin69::rolllthunder.    now are u starting to believe me?!?!?              trust me...I wouldn't lie about living in oklaoma...MY ENTIRE LIFE
dddevin69::omg,    rollthunder and i have the same bday.   unreal....89ers day
RollThunder35::Earth day!
RollThunder35::i suppose.
dddevin69::i guess we have a connection?
dddevin69::RollThunder35i freely admit, i was a light Spurs fan.  Then i went crazy for the Hornets   (BANDWAGON), and then found out OKC was coming (JUMPED ON NEW BANDWAGON) and have been ballz out OKC fan since.  I have nothing to hide           (BANDWAGON GOIN STRONG!   GO GET EM....GO POKES!  WHOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)                                                 there, i corrected it for you.......
ChilamBilam12::How are you suppose to be a Thunder fan before the team even existed?.. i don't get that concept.. i'm not going to claim to be a life long Sonic fan living in Tulsa Oklahoma.. people tend to adjust the teams they follow when a state gets its first professional sports team ever.. sorry it happens
RollThunder35::this is logical though Chilam.  ^
RollThunder35::artsy!!!
dddevin69::thanks
dddevin69::36
RollThunder35::im 41.  born in Stillwater, OK.
RollThunder35::yay!
dddevin69::dude, i was born on april 22, 1975     we have the same bday
RollThunder35::April 22, 1971
dddevin69::rollthunder......i've lived in oklahoma longer than u have
RollThunder35::age?
dddevin69::at least oklahoma has more churches than meth labs......oh wait
ChilamBilam12::Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, and California all have more last i checked.. and who gives a damn anyway?
RollThunder35::im not sure, but i think i just exposed devin.
ChilamBilam12::rollthunder has been posting on these boards for a couple years now.. following in and out, good and bad.. but i haven't seen you devin.. still not buying that you are anything close to an Oklahoma resident or Thunder fan
RollThunder35::funny enough, i didnt know about chat boards til last season though.
dddevin69::no, u exposed urself as a BANDWAGON fan         RollThunder35Light Spurs fan, wasnt completely into it
RollThunder35::i freely admit, i was a light Spurs fan.  Then i went crazy for the Hornets, and then found out OKC was coming and have been ballz out OKC fan since.  I have nothing to hide
RollThunder35::devin is a fukking liar. sad.
dddevin69::uh, why would I lie about being in a racist backwoods redneck state like Oklahoma?!?!?!?
RollThunder35::if it sux so bad, why are you here?
dddevin69::rollthunder=  typical backwoods oklahoma.  he can't comprehend in his brain that someone would disagree with him.  he probably emails racists jokes about obama to his friends at the local car repair shop while they spit and chew tobacco
dddevin69::eskimo joes is in stillwater rolllthunder.    sigh
RollThunder35::googled again.  damn man, u r lying.  if it sux so bad, why are you here?
dddevin69::rollthunder........          trust me..nobody......and i mean nobody would lie about being from a redneck backwoods state like Oklahoma.  that's like lying about having a fat hairy wife.   "my wife is fat and ugly"   "no she isn't...she's a supermodel...ur lying!!!!"    sorry doesn't make sense
ChilamBilam12::why hate on Oklahoma so much if it is your home state?.. most people i know wouldn't trade a move to too many other places, if you really knew this state and how great it can be, especially in some of the bigger city's, you wouldn't make that claim... the people are some of the best you'll run into anywhere, and i have traveled enough to have seen a.s.s holes from coast to coast..
RollThunder35::okay then.   where is eskimo joes at? spencer or Moore?
