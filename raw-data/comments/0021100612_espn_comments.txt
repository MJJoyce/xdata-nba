Gex.2::its straight up war in there (bos - mia board)
BBFocus::Someday this season or next one, I expected Lin would get his first triple double (10+ in points, 10+ in rebounds, and 10+ in assists, and 5 blocks and 5 steals) somewhere...
oa92000::lin- 15 pts, 11 shots, 3 STL, 3BLK, 8 ASSIST rose 32 pts, 29 shots, 0 STL, 0 BLK, 7 ASSIST  who is better?
53Kevin::Also failed to mention the +/- Typical Knicks fan........ROSE +6     LIN -4  Dont just come on here to be a dufus biased Knicks fan just to make your false claim about Lin being better.
53Kevin::TYPICAL KNICK FAN,FAILED TO INCLUDE THE REBOUNDS!Rose 6 boards Lin 1 board
53Kevin::ROSE!
al05569::btw,could we stop deluding ourselves into believing that jeremy lin's performance and the knicks woes, are simply due to carmelo anthony's presence on the floor?  do we really believe that Lin would've continued to put up those amazing performaces and the knicks would've kept on winning, if only carmelo hadn't come back? ...I think  teams have simply  figured out a way to stop jeremy lin and maybe the knicks may not be as good as we thought or wanted them to be...I personally feel that way.....looking at the knicks roster, I don't really see any good, consistent role players that can perform well in their roles night in night out...novak is a great shooter but I feel like his game is too unidimensional and predictable...if a team really keys in on his three point shot, then what else does he have?...not like the knicks have a good reliable point guard like nash (younger nash) or CP to penetrate and set him up......jr smith, though offensively talented, has always and continues to be streaky.....shumpert,  primarily good on the defensive end.....landry fields, nothing special.....chandler you definitely need for defense and rebounding, so he's definitely an asset in that regard and he has certainly played well in that role....which now brings me to the big stars...carmelo and stoudemire....carmelo  to me just seems like he's a scoring machine who whenever he gets the ball, puts his head down and tries to figure a way to put the ball in the basket which isn't necessarily the best play for the team during a given possession...other great scorers like lebron, kobe and dwade seem to be thinking about scoring and making the best play for their team which normally involves finding another player who can get a higher percentage shot....they have better playmaking (scoring &amp; passing) ability than carmelo anthony....stoudemire is a good scorer and average rebounder but you just don't get the sense he's the superstar type caliber player like a karl malone or charles barkley that you can always count on when you need him in the clutch...he did show flashes of brilliance that one month last season when he averaged like 30 points or more for about 9 straight games last season and was completely unstoppable...I wonder if we'll ever see that stoudemire again....when its all said and done, I'm not so sure the knicks have the stuff championship teams or winning teams for that matter are made of....smart/clutch star players and consistent role players....Most teams that attain success in the NBA normally have those two ingredients.
al05569::I for one was never completely sold on Jeremy Lin during that winning streak because I just didn't feel like he was talented enough to sustain that level of play...don't get me wrong he put up great numbers but I just had a hunch when I was watching him during those games, that he was just taking advantage of the fact that teams didn't know who he was and how to go about guarding him...I really wanted to see how he would perform over a longer period of time, say a month or two because that element of surprise wouldn't be on his side anymore....that's when I would have considered him legit if he could've sustained that same level of productivity.....With time, teams have made a more concerted effort to neutralize his strengths and he really hasn't put up the same numbers he was putting up, nor being as effective... I'm not saying he's a bad point guard, but I don't think he's the type of player he was being made out to be during the whole linsanity streak...at best I think he is an average run of the mill nba point guard....averages about 12 points 6 assists a night....is expendable/tradealbe by any team he's on, because he just isn't that critical of a player that a team can't do without him.
theseck::For all Knicks fan out there, interesting article on http://biojungle.blogspot.com/2012/03/lin-vs-knicks-or-linsanity-was-pleasant.html
picasso1901::excellent analysis
Jamaal 43::Amare better thank his lucky starts that Melo gets the lion share of the blame and Lin is now the teams 8 game hero or his crappy play would be front and center.
doggbrown1::I'm Stephan A Smith, please say the A baby.
yale203::Lin is due for a huge pay increase.  the amount he contributes to the team for the money he makes is pathetic.
houstontee@yahoo.com::last thing..WITH COACH D' SYSTEM,, CHANDLER NEED TO PRACTICE MORE ON HIS FREE THROWS.
houstontee@yahoo.com::MELO 8-21=21 POINTS.........LIN  4-11= 15POINTS  .. 6 ONLY POINTS DIFFERENT,  10 SHOTS MORE, DO YOUR MATH.. WHO SHOULD BE SHOOTING MORE?? THAT WHY IT WAS 8-15 IN THE FIRST PLACE BEFORE LIN..when melo +stat was out... better defense, better chemistry, better rebounding, better hussle plays..knicks loses b/c MELO + STAT dosnt do much of the above plays .. BUT YOU STILL NEED THEM FOR THE PLAYOFF..
tyler5406::The only guys I have ever made more money on betting against them is Allen Iverson (selfish) and Tracy McGrady (selfish)... PLEASE DONT TRADE HIM!!!!!!!!
tyler5406::I love making money betting against the CANCER carmelo Anthony.  Please dont trade him!!!!!!!
vballboy55::Lin is extremely overrated... any point guard could put up those stats against terrible teams... now that they are playing quality teams he isn't doing anything special even though he has two all stars on his team... and he cannot play defense... just because a player gets steals does not mean he is good at defense... deng doesnt get steals but he is the best defender on the bulls...
scarsquad::pls give me the definition of overrate. lowest wage in league need to take the responsibility of other 2 guys with 50M "super stars" cannot do? give me a fat $@%!$@% break you can blame anyone of Knicks but Lin. if w/o him knicks already in the bottom of the league.
yale203::scarsquad is credited !
lbcguy2000::Yeah, I'm sure every point guard is dying to have the Pillsbury dough boy and broken down Amare on their team eating up 36 million in cap space.  Yeah, send them to the Clippers so that Melo's buddy CP3 (who just got trashed by Rondo) can show us how great they are.
pk9394::Lin can't play D that is why the Knicks lost, DRose scored 30+ on him, and this is not the first time someone scored huge on Lin.  Lin need to step up a big way on his D.
poisonpill28::Lin is hardly a shut down defender, but since Rondo torched him he's hardly been defending the opposing PG. Most of Rose's points were on someone other than Lin. Same with the opposing PGs the previous few games.
pk9394::stop blaming the Coach, any coach can come up with the perfect defense plan on paper.  The bigger problem is the excution part, it don't help when you have players like Amare that had his feet glued on the floor.  I think the real blame on D'Antoni is he need to have the balls to scream at anyone not moving their feet and bench him even if he is a superstar.
Does Wayne Brdy Hfta Djokovic::team doesn't play D. First step is securing the def rebound. Next step is being accountable. D'Antoni can't teach either.
Does Wayne Brdy Hfta Djokovic::Lin just gave Mike a little more time to get his resume in order
CD Dogg::Hmmm...there is definitely a weakness, some kind of defect,  in the Knick's armor.
CD Dogg::Oh, come on ESPN, can't you fire somebody and make it all better for the Knicks?

getmine73::knicks wont even make the playoffs
tipoff2008::They will but their appearance will be like entering a revolving door only to end up back on the street
yale203::Now everyone is up in arms in Syracuse-land that the other Melo, Fab Melo, is inelibible to play in NCAA playoffs.  Now, they say he averages 8 points a game.  That is all ?  And everybody thinks it is a big blow to Syracuse.  But Lin averages double than that per game and people saying Lin not all that.  I do not get this illogic.
wilhenderso::Yale, seriously shut the $@%! up. I bet you despise Lin and trolling the boards to get more people to hate him more than the media already has done.
yale203::yeah, i hate lin.  lol.  go away wil.
getmine73::cause you are 10 &amp; just started watching basketball. Melo is a 7 footer that makes team adjust shots in the paint

Archbob1::Maybe if they trade Melo for a real star.
yale203::No man Knicks will be in playoffs and will surprise.  we didn't have this linsanity just to end up as also rans.  we're going all the way to the quarter-finals, at least.
PutYouOn::thats to bold...there not gunna do anything
PutYouOn::hope so so the dumb arrogant fans can shut up
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::MMMEEEELLLOOOOO had to take a break, his mom is giving him a bath and changing his diaper.
Jamaal 43::Sad: Almost every Knick lost this season has been a close game no matter who they play. The spot light is and will always be on Mike Damn Toni as a result.

Thetruth972555::BS BS BS and more BS. Blame on Lin all you want. The Knick allow 91pts/gm during Linsanity and 108pts/gm when Melo and Stat come back. There is a reason why Melo's teammate call him the black hole of offense.
HoneymoonCity3443::James Dolan for anything left with sports dignity for the betterment of NY sell the Knicks and Rangers.

Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::You better start because Milwaukee holds the 8th and final spot.
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::Knicks already 9th praying for Cleveland and Milwaukee to go on a losing streak. Maybe the Knicks can get 2 wins from Toronto out of the next 9. Doubt it tho
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::WE DON'T PRAY FOR OTHERS TO LOSE LIKE YOU BUMS  WE ARE JUST WORRIED ABOUT OUR SELVES
PutYouOn::or lottery bound
054sandra::The problem for the Knicks is along the same plane as the Miami Heat, that is; the media create this quiet storm, then when their half-baked creation takes on any wings they call for all hands on deck to promote this monster. Obviously, in Lins case he couldn't live up to these lofty expectation even if it made for good copy - and lining up pockets for sports shows - ads, the like. The reason being: that every NBA player at the point position - worth his salt - would be lying in wait for the Linsanity machine. Now, once the game starts the media can't save him - except to ignore when D.Williams gave hime 38. In addition, the SCHEDULE dictated that the knicks play on the road against more quality teams. Therefore, the build-up for the Miami Heat game was way off the radar. You just knew LeBron, Wade, Bosh, and the heat team were not having any of it! That brings me to my 2nd point. LeBron James is expected to do incredible feats day-in-day-out, and for the most parts delivers with all this pressure! Why, because he just happens to be the best player in the game who can "fade" the medias onslaught. More people watch the Heat because they - The Media- promote them on both fronts - the good team - and the hated team
Archbob1::The heat are actually good, the Knicks suck.
StormGrace420::Most of what you said made sense, except that last part, in which you confuse cause and effect. People don't watch the Heat because of the media attention, they give the media attention because that is the team everyone is watching, and talking about.
getmine73::i hope Melo does get traded cause knick fans are the worst. faith in Lin but not Melo who is a proven NBA talent
Thetruth972555::It matter when the team is -16, -22, -18 when Melo is on the floor.
Jamaal 43::I thought about that actually. Melo has played well in more games than not but when they lose, it's Melo's fault no matter how shi#y anyone else plays.
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::IT'S MOSTLY HATERS
getmine73::its all haters
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::You talk sh!it, I THROW IT RIGHT BACK IN YOUR FKIN FACE PUSSSSZIES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::You must be a teen on spring break
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::Talk of the NBA ?  lmao
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::Just like your Knicks
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::THE KNICKS ARE NOTHING LIKE YOU   IF THEY WERE THEY WOULDNT BE THE TALK OF THE NBA AND NO ONE WOULD GO WATCH THEM OR SPEND THEIR TIME ON THEM
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::LLLLLLLLLLLOOTTTTEEEEEEERRRYYYYYYY
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::WEEEEEEEEEEEEEAK
Jamaal 43::Question, why didn’t Mike Damn Toni call a time out after Kyle went 1 - 2 from the line and the Knicks had 3 timeouts left down 5 with 48.5 seconds in regulation!?
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::Sometimes coaches call teh TO and sometimes they don't
getmine73::because he sucks
Jamaal 43::That's more like it =) That's not good vs good teams
getmine73::thats the truth. he doesnt make adjustment
Jamaal 43::lol True but I was looking for a detailed basketball answer
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::i love coming to Loserville, I mean ESPN boards, throwing the sh!!t ppl talk right back into their face!!!!!!!
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::ummm i don't watch football, nice try tho CORKY

PutYouOn::who the hell said that on here???this is basketball fool...
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::STFUA, YOU CAN'T TELL THE FUTURE  YOU WERE HERE NOT TO LONG AGO SAYING THE PACKERS WOULD CRUSH THE GGGGGMEN, THEN THE 9ERS THEN THE PATS  HOWD THAT WORK OUT FOR YOU, THE WORST FORTUNE TELLER I EVER MET
PutYouOn::its sad that you thrive on talking s h i t to people on here
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::He roots for Melo, have pity on him/her and stop picking on down syndrome kids.
PutYouOn::...................yea were very jealous your teams struggling
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::You come here mad and it doesnt work and you can't handle it  im not mad lmfao  KNICKS ARE THE TALK OF THE NBA, DEAL WITH IT
PutYouOn::haha you come here mad cuz the knicks cant perform like you fans want them to..and wanna talk crap
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::stop loooking in the mirror already
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::And your name should read CCCCCAAAAANNNNCCCCCEEEERRRR
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::You must be the mayor
PutYouOn::im not a butthurt as b i t c h like you...you use caps locks to make your dumb insults look good...knicks have been shut down 6 game losing streak..and your hope for the teams gunna get shutdown...loser likes to be a keyboard tough guy
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::THAT'S ALL YOU GOT  SHUT DOWNNNNNNNNNNN
PutYouOn::trust me i dont ..i dont wanna come on the espn boards like you and get all butthurt..
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::YOU WISH YOU WERE ME, I KNOW  IM SO GLAD IM NOT YOU, TRYING MY HARDEST TO PUT THE KNICKS DOWN
PutYouOn::tell me what facts??

PutYouOn::all u got is insults...
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::There you are.  Just in time, i need to take a sh!it, come with me so i can wipe my @ss with you
Jaguarcrazyboy::Ever been to sorryville?
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::Where's that?
Jaguarcrazyboy::Chicago got the win.. But I'd like to see a blow out win last night..
chicagofan68::three of our top 6 scorers being out kind of hurt too
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::That's the thing about these knicks, they are in every game, just need to get over the hump like the gggggggggggmen
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::In a tight game with the crippled bulls.. sad
Castro for MVP::knicks fans ya done?
PutYouOn::some knicks fans are annoying
iaadcf92::It is entirely possible that at some point Amare and Melo will click and get into a zone, all the while getting feeds from Lin (who will still drive hard to the basket), with Novak and Landry shooting lights out from the perimeter.
Joliet62::At least the Knicks have the lottery to look forward too......
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::By that time Knicks will be 10th or 11th in the East planning fishing trips.
StormGrace420::I agree
Thetruth972555::If Melo and Stat can do their part on defense and not worry so much on who get the most points. The Knick can be very dangerous.
superman253540::You sound like the kid with the deadbeat parent waiting at the window while it is raining
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::If you have to be asked to improve yourself and your game, you aren't a superstar.
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::What history is that ?
Castro for MVP::^truth
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::Non of us do because all they were ever asked to do their whole career was to play offense.  We will find out how good they can be in the future.  History has shown that good offensive players are good defensive players also
Thetruth972555::Lebron and Wade are very good defensive players and athletic too. I don't know about Melo and Stat
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::superman is scared, got defensive with you  happened for the heat last year after everyone and their mother was saying the same thing, lebron and wade can't coexist, fire the coach, trade the players
lovesports3409::The Knicks really don't want to see the Bulls anytime soon. Did you see their faces? They knew it was a wrap.
lovesports3409::They played defeated to me. Most of the game.
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::They looked like a team lost to me, not defeated.  they are just having a tough time right now
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::When?  When the game is over and they lost.  ya that is usually what happens.  it's not like they blew them out!!!!!!!!!!!1
Castro for MVP::i agree that the knicks do not want to see the bulls but this was a close game
Thetruth972555::SAVE THIS POST .....#8 seed Knick over #1 seed Bulls. Rose shot 25%FG as usual in the playoff. Knick advance to 2nd round. Knick will go back to Linsanity defense again.
Thetruth972555::The Knick will be hot come playoff time.  The knick Linsanity defense will come back again.
PutYouOn::racist???you guys are to inlove with lin..scoring passing stealing machine..thats corny
PutYouOn::ohh wow just cuz rose got 4 to's doesnt take the fact away that lin does it often
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::ya he's just a hater, if there is 20 good things and 1 bad he will pick out the bad instead of talking and making sense he talks nonsense  just another loser who needs attention, any kind  these losers come hear and say different things but all you hear is i need a reply, i need attention
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::No he isn't, he is a scoring, passing, stealing machine
Thetruth972555::FYI, Rose got more TO look at the stat, Racist and hater
Castro for MVP::Lin is still a TO machine
PutYouOn::alright then...just know eli manning dont play basketball
Thetruth972555::We'll see. Don't be scare Bulls fan.
PutYouOn::butthurt? you should be worried they been playing like garbage...ahaha championship?
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::your the steaming pile of crap worrying about now and not worrying about winning the championship
PutYouOn::the knicks arent in the 8th seed of today there record is 18-24..regular season does matter if your team is right below the 8th seed..and has been a steaming pile of crap
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::what does that even mean.  oh ya, nothing
Castro for MVP::you cant compare football to basketball
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::see you just don't understand, i put it in black n white in my post
PutYouOn::tell me how did i contradict my self..cuz i stated there record..there not in the 8th seed..point blank
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::see your such an idiot contradicting yourself.  do you ever say anything serious or just spit nonsense all day long cause your a complete moron.  you name the reg season records and then say you don't worry to much about the reg season
PutYouOn::im not saying that..just saying they havent been doing good and theres 1 -8th seed so its not like u automatically make the playoffs u have to be atleast 8th seed..
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::exactly, you don't know.  you don't understand  just like every other team who thinks the reg season makes a champion
PutYouOn::yeah i guess??
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::reg season means nothing.  look at the giants  15-1    9-7
PutYouOn::35-9....18-24
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::nobodies scared of the bulls
PutYouOn::scared of what? u guys havent done anything impressive all season?
PutYouOn::dude there lottery bound right now not even 8th seed...if the bulls have deng and rip they dont stand a chance...18-24
al05569::thank you for bringing some basic common sense to this whole knicks mess...I for one was never completely sold on Jeremy Lin during that winning streak because I just didn't feel like he was talented enough to sustain that level of play...don't get me wrong he put up great numbers but I just had a hunch when I was watching him during those games, that he was just taking advantage of the fact that teams didn't know who he was and how to go about guarding him...I really wanted to see how he would perform over a longer period of time, say a month or two because that element of surprise wouldn't be on his side anymore....that's when I would have considered him legit if he could've sustained that same level of productivity.....With time teams have made a more concerted effort to neutralize his strengths and he really hasn't put up the same numbers he was putting up, nor being as effective... I'm not saying  he's a bad point guard, but I don't think he's the type of player he was being made out to be during the whole linsanity streak...at best I think he is an average run of the mill nba point guard....averages about 12 points 6 assists a night....is expendable/tradealbe by any team he's on, because he just isn't that critical of a player that a team can't do without him.
StormGrace420::Not really, it wasn't and still isn't about "melo OR stat coming back, it's about tougher teams and film study breaking down J Lin's game and working on his weaker areas, J Lin will be a decent PG if/when he expands his game and eliminates his weaknesses
PutYouOn::we'll see after 20 games where there at
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::Everyone and their mother saw that comin tho
Thetruth972555::I'm good at predicting the future. See my post couple weeks ago about when Melo and Stat come back. And about the Knick defense when these two come back. I'm spot on.
theseck::I dont think Knicks will come back to the state where we all can cheer any time soon. No matter which direction we're pointing our fingers, that's obvious that there's something missing in the team.   http://biojungle.blogspot.com/2012/03/lin-vs-knicks-or-linsanity-was-pleasant.html
StormGrace420::yes, something is missing, and that is experience together, i think Knicks hold on to 8th seed, and should be ready to gel by playoff time.
Castro for MVP::Knicks are currently 9th
MMMMEEEEEEEEELLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOO::I hope so storm, i hope so.  BIGGGGG BLLLUEEEEEEE DID IT NOT THAT LONG AGOOOOO
PutYouOn::im not in the mood to read a book lol
