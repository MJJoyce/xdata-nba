goldfish847::bobcats draft B.Griner with #1 pick
Paul96857::DOn't know Jon3717, Not a rivalry when they don't play often http://bit.ly/HWaxQi
Aleat_beast::Andrea Bargnani continues to amaze how does a seven foot starter only get 3 Rebounds? If you looked at his lines from game to game you think he was a 2 guard.
KyberAntillies::LMAO 93 comments
Bynum is Mature::Arizona bill could criminalize Internet trolling   http://games.yahoo.com/blogs/plugged-in/arizona-bill-could-criminalize-internet-trolling-184547052.html  Arizona is a joke of state hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahaha
winfield47::surprised how close this game was. it's like only 3 players scored for the raps tonight. amir and james johnson take the night off?
hawks14533::Over looked good until the garbage 3rd quarter. Knew i should of picked the bobcats
leo9212::I feel bad to even troll the bobcats game
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Raptors 1 NBA 0
PASS__THA__SWISHA::yes. under.
azwildcatfan10234::Have Mullens shoot a game tying 3? that's always smart
Raptorsfan080::RAPTORS WIN RAPTORS WINNNNNNNN
thestatetexas::barn for 2
azwildcatfan10234::Augustin with the 3
azwildcatfan10234::Charlotte should have had Henderson in there instead of Williams
PIDI9093::cmon Raptors...just win by 5
PASS__THA__SWISHA::Bobcats drilling 3s ... please no OT. I want this under.
PASS__THA__SWISHA::Mother F'ing Byron Mullens ...
winfield47::who is this guy anyway?
flip2114::hey lAsomughal, what happened to the raptors easily winning by 10 and covering the spread? you dumb $@%!
flip2114::either way i look at it, the bobcats covered you $@%!$@%
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Your right the referees covered
JoeyDorsey4MVP::The referees happened genious!
KnucknBUC:::Lol these teams have no fans
d_gettis12::Charlotte had good fans, but why worry about a 7-44 team?
college hill cincinnati::Charlotte does too. From one Queen City to the other.
Raptorsfan080::RAPTORS DO!
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Idiot! I went to the United Center in 2004 when chicago was terrible and there maybe were 5,000 fans there. I guess the Bulls have no fans right?  I actually fell asleep during the game the building was soo boring.   It was against new jersey when that team was relevant.
JoeyDorsey4MVP::It takes only one or two blatantly biased calls to throw the Raptors off their game, the NBA is doing there job at keeping Toronto perenially mediocre.  No wonder, Bosh left, he goes from a team the NBA wants to lose to one the networks (ESPN) wants to win.   Of course, this whole league is rigged.
McKenzi2801::lego ot
zeterpink1::knicks epic 4th quarter collapse.
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Now, the bobcats get a foul call in their favour every possesion and raptors get zero, calls classic.
azwildcatfan10234::B.J. Mullens actually living up to what he was supposed to be in college?
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Wow, two bobcats run into each other..one flops and the refs  call an offensive foul on the Raptors...the worst officials in pro sports no question.
MadmanMark14::I thought the Bobcats had Way better talent than what their record shows this year
winfield47::they have next to no talent. i feel bad for them. have you seen their rotation?
TheGeneral90499::I have a feeling that if they had started Kemba over Augustin they would be much better.
zeterpink1::i thought bobcats +450 was a steal risk reward
zeterpink1::every time they get it within 4 they lose momentum
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Case 101 of the league not wanting the Raptors to win.  A defender purposely runs into Derozan  and falls down and Derozan gets called for the offensive foul.
lAsomughal::This is sad.... Bobcats could have tied the game, and then they throw the ball away like that twice in a row. They will lose with atleast 9 points here, you heard it from here first. It's sad to watch bobcats being that awful in a game like this..
bmitch585::what's this somebody mentioned about lebron blaming chalmers? is it official that they don't get along? i've never seen them beefing on the court (though i don't have league pass so don't watch enough).
azwildcatfan10234::One way you know your team is terrible : Eduardo Najera is playing a lot...
azwildcatfan10234::Najera is terrible compared to the athletes out there today.
bmitch585::he's like a 6' 9'' kapono with a mean streak. he's not terrible. not an all-star but not terrible.
bmitch585::najera is a bruiser with a great stroke. he's always been solid.
milankzs::why is augustin on the bench?
azwildcatfan10234::DeRozan and Henderson both showed up..

BasketballWives754::Good stuff
lAsomughal::This kid is so stupid "No way Raptors can win with -9 spread" &lt;--- please say that again idiot. This game is done.
1Dre8::The Charlotte Shitcats
Kujosh54321::creative
Tim_Hanson946438::Charlotte Bobcats vs. Toronto Raptors   randomly found this site with winners:   http://bit.ly/HSkxf8
pappydiving222::Damnit.  I just realized even if the cats lose out, their 7-53 record would have a higher win% than the 76ers 9 win season :(  AARON GRAY TIME
hokies63::um it's would be 7-59 dum**** and no it not if the bobcats lose the rest of their games the win % is .106 and the 76ers was .110 and Im a diehard cats fan so i hope they get one more W
Amyxow::Well i guess i can kiss my under 188 bet bye bye... just  my luck suddenly these lame teams shoot like the spurs &amp; thunder lol
PASS__THA__SWISHA::Under 188 should hit no problem.
PASS__THA__SWISHA::Raps 2nd half moneyline?
patrickallen92::As of late teams with higher odds to win the lottery have got the short end, as Cleavland won last year with the 8th best chance i think. Not sure how o feel about tanking, it would let me rest easy on lottery night knowing the raps should get a top 5 pick but i dont know if thats worth losing all these games and breeding a losing culture. That being said, we need a top 3 pick for MKG. I think he will be great the only thing is i dont know how he would work on our team. If not MKG brad beal is a perfect fit.
jeff050578::Go Raptors. We need the Raptors and Kings to finish with a better record then Golden State. Then the warriors wont have to send their first ! round draft pick to the Jazz. Go Raptors. Go Warriors

Raptorsfan080::LETS GOOO RAPTORSSSSSSS!
lAsomughal::They have won already
lAsomughal::Some1 said before "Why is the spread -9 to Raptors, they are too bad to win it" This is why you $@%!$@%, you see; Raptors will easily win with 10 points, and you are a $@%!$@% if you cannot see it. This game is done.
