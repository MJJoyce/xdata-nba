Mark::It will be interesting to see how the Celtics perform when Rondo is inserted into the lineup.
Jack Rowland::Ainge claims Celtics not tanking, but the way their new coach is using the players it sure seems like it. In tonights game if Faverani had played the 20 minutes that Bass did and Bass had played Faverani's 4 minutes they would possibly have , with more minutes from Humphries, beaten San Antonio. Has there ever been an ex college coach that did do any good in the NBA???
Daniel D::There are games where the Celtics do have some hope. This doesn't appear to be one of them but after the Miami game anything is possible.
Andy::No way will the Celtics beat us tonight!!!! I know the spurs might not make it to the finals again but man they better.
Hype::guys I think the Spurs are serious this time
Michael::1 1/2 out with 69 to play!   Here we go Celtics  here we go!
Mark::Faverani got two quick fouls, one foul in his first second.  That was it for him.
drdrazen::Common Ainge...it's been a while since you traded someone...Let's trade again...You did a great job...this team is awesome...magnificant basketball they are playing...Future champions...Danny you are the Celtics...trade...trade...trade...you can start with yourself...JERK!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S. Coach Pop - the best in the nba...
Teh::What's wrong with Danny Green?
Ruben::Yeah, if he only goes to buffets & weight watchers...what should he expect
