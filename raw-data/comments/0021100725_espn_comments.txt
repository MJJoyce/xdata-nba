jtthebrick14::Golden State purposely tanking would be silly.  We don't even know at this point how many underclassmen will be in the draft, or how deep next year's draft will be.  Golden State will probably finish between 8 and 14 next year too.  Are they going to tank to the top 6 next year?  And then the year after that too?   Teach your players to win.
VikomnLA::Am I the only one who noticed that Sessions has started to walk the ball up the floor instead of running like he didwhen Ramon first came to The Lakers. I swear to God, Mike Brown is going to ruin every player he tries to coach.
alwaysbesinkinthosemavs::Ive been following a betting system recently called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I found this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I recommend this system to anyone that is looking for a system that actually works. Thought I would post this for anyone frustrated of not winning thier bets
kevinrsx408::seems like the warriors lost the game purposely if u watch that last play. rush was open n hes one of the leagues best 3 pt shooters
BigPage25::Golden State should of won this game
iloveeverythingespnloves::WHY DID THEY BEAT THE KINGS LAST TIME!!!!!!!!!!!! UGH DOESNT KLAY GET THE MEMO LOSE EVERY GAME OUT!
spurs_sweep::wow, you guys won one. Good for you.
OregonUniversity95::We won 23. which is 3 more than you
terrapin1dixon::Um, he's clearly a Spurs fan. Fail.
WFan5::isn't the pick based on the order of the draft lottery? losing will only better the odds for the warriors at getting into top 7.
mydotcom::the real big 3? miami? boston? nahhh scalibrine luke walton and kwame brown http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/p/best-nba-memes.html
WarriorsWarrior::Good to see we have a sec140 solid rep for our warriors even wen losing. goodnight folks!
RED_GOLD_MANNING::Ignorant people have small brains
GeorgeZimmmerman::REPUBLICANS HAVE SMALL BRAINS????  MEOW!!!
cowpoke85::What Manning is wearing red and gold...?
Jason21414::MARK JACKSON COST ME MY 5 TEAM NIGG-R  MONEY LINE PARLAY
ironmike301::####  you and your trailor trash mom ....Your the type of racist that hate black men just because were everthing you want to be... AND YOU KNOW IT!!! HAHAHAHA....your a  ####  dude,I bet you put your head down when you walk bye black people on the street because your afraid to look a real man in the eye!
goosu123::alright, racism back at racism solves nothing. They are just trolls.
Jason21414::LIKE THAT NIGG=R TRAYVON,  HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED,  THAT IOIOT WEATING A HOOD IN 80 DEGREE HEAT
GeorgeZimmmerman::JASON, DO YOU EXPERIMENT SEXUALLY?  CAN YOU SEND ME A SHIRTLESS PIC?  HAWT!  MEOW!!!
GeorgeZimmmerman::JASON, NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, WEAR A HOODIE.  MEOW!!!
Jason21414::REASON GOLDEN STATE LOST IS THEY HAVE A NIGG=R COACH WHO HAS NO CLUE HOW TO HANDLE A CLIPBOARD,   THE X'S AND O'S LOOK CHINESE TO THAT MONKEY MARK JACKSON!!!
ironmike301::$@%! you and your $@%!$@ trailor trash mom :-) ....Your the type of racist that hate black men just because were everthing you want to be:-)
RED_GOLD_MANNING::I bet you'd do a remarkable job replacing him
GeorgeZimmmerman::GEEZ.  AND I THOUGHT I WAS A RACIST!  MEOW!!!
WarriorsWarrior::wow and u do?
RED_GOLD_MANNING::Raymond kinda sucks though, you can't blame nate for him missing threes. And turning the ball over. Or LA emphatically choosing to pop instead of roll every play. Raymond has a lot to prove and 6 assists isn't gonna cut it.
GeorgeZimmmerman::AGREED.  MEOW!!!
GeorgeZimmmerman::NAME ONE POINT GUARD THAT LIKED PLAYING UNDER NATE.  TRICK QUESTION.  THERE ISN'T ONE.  MEOW!!!
cowpoke85::Felton might have had his best game of the season tonight... been playing good ball lately. Must have finally got into game shape. Maybe we will keep him on as a backup...
cowpoke85::If he keeps up the good work we might have to bring him back. Very clutch tonight... A real offseason next year and maybe he will come back in shape...
GeorgeZimmmerman::NO POINT GUARD CAN SUCCEED UNDER NATE.  WE NEED TO GIVE RAY-RAY A SECOND LOOK NOW THAT 'SARGE' IS GONE.  MEOW!!!
GeorgeZimmmerman::BLAZERS LOOK LIKE A PLAYOFF TEAM NOW THAT NATE IS GONE.  MEOW!!!
BJOCIC::i hate dorell wright, he is a piece of $@%!
RED_GOLD_MANNING::Who is coaching that team down in GS? They blew that game pretty methodically
Oaktown1029::20 seconds left - Portland knew they would try a three - easy defense!
RED_GOLD_MANNING::Lol. Warriors coach didn't let Dorrell shoot the last three.
jzalvarado::ha.. i love your nick
Rip_City27::Good game Blazers, nice talkin warrior yall are classy and fun to talk too..
WarriorsWarrior::gg
truetopia::why not go to RJ for the last 3? ugghh!
xuscbs::Jenkins should have given up on Klay and that side of the court, it was well defended, option B, drive to the basket and kick it out to Rush or RJ.  But, easy for me to say....
truetopia::true, true..
Ellenwood20::No one on the warriors can create their own shot...fml
jzalvarado::Funny all the fans NOW talking about Tanking JUST SHOWED up.
WarriorsGO::Lol
Sour_BACK27::Mark Jackson might be a great guy but damn, some horrible HORRIBLE play calling in the final seconds.
truetopia::the final play did look pretty bad.. the one before with Rush in the corner was nice though
Rip_City27::Yeah that was a broken play
dreamhax::more like good defense.
dreamhax::wow the refs were so fnnn bad. how do you not call a foul when charles jenkins goes for a lay up and gets smacked in the face?
bmosheman::NBA refs always stink
xuscbs::Not bad for 2 rookies to make the Blazers sweat a 3-point win at home!
KijanaCam::Keep losing Dubs.  We need that draft pick.
WFan5::isn't the pick based on the order of the draft lottery?  losing will only better the odds at getting into top 7.
sfninergiant510::realize were not getting that pick
kurtfool::in 20 seconds GS to couldnt put off a decent shot.
jzalvarado::This is where the Warriors ROOKIE-NESS/Inexperience absolutely showed up.  They had NO idea Instinctively WHAT TO DO
truetopia::i thought that was one reason they picked up RJ.. but didn't see him used at the end
JimboNoyes::BLAZERS WIN  !!!! OH YEAH. BABY SUCK ON THAT TANK LOVERS
SB4LlFE::Good job W's. Gotta keep the tank alive.
sfninergiant510::sorry not keeping the pick
vicenza10::wtf warriors last possession?
Rip_City27::Good game Blazers
kurtfool::what a terrible last attempt. that was so ugly
RED_GOLD_MANNING::Since my blazers have no chance of winning in the playoffs they need to lose out and get 3 good picks.
Rip_City27::I'd rather make the playoffs than miss by a couple games
popitoff12::Manning came to Denver!!!\  We have a slim shot at playoffs
23germany::not-so Golden State just another worthless franchise.....there is not a single player you need in a contending team  so they just run around and play stupid junkball and then go home and watch TV
WarriorsGO::Cool story bro.
Oaktown1029::get the 2 quickly and then foul.
DB.503::And it's a great day to be a Blazer
Rip_City27::Come on now dont jinx us
DB.503::Don't worry this isn't the NBA draft, we cant mess it up
apeterlives::rush should take the host
WarriorsGO::Thompson or Rush for 3 should be the play.
woooooooooo0000000000::whats happening espn doesn't update
jzalvarado::I hope they give it to Monta Ellis here to take the final shot and send this puppy into overtime
WarriorsGO::Misses more then he makes. Especially 3s
Rip_City27::lol
Rip_City27::Who's shootin it??
kurtfool::klay
balmainbandit::miss the 3 rush
Rip_City27::Clutch ft's LA
apeterlives::3 for the OT?
kurtfool::klays about to hit it!
apeterlives::I hope it goes OT it just started getting good
kurtfool::rush had been nailing that shot all night
