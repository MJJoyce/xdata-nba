Xander::Crazy game. Pek and K-Love miss point blank gimmes to send the game into overtime. That Crawford halfcourt heave proved to be pretty important. No shame for Minny, they played a competitive game tonight and nearly walked away with a W. Watching Love at UCLA I never would have thought he'd develop into such a productive pro, good for him!
Dan::Great game Wolves, especially on a back to back. Get the next one.
Donald::The Timberwolves don't messed around  because they almost swept both LA teams but this time the Clippers won.
Cyril::It's amazing that Deandre Jordan can have such a fundamentally sound free-throw shooting form and still miss so many of them.
gary strong::Hopefully after this game Blake will appreciate his need to hit free throws and focus on that for the next two years. There would be no stopping him at 75%+. He is lucky that Deandre just happens to be worse than he is or it would be hack-a-Blake
Homey D Clown::Apt.24... shall I continue?
Busy cutting crap::Wow, the refs hand the Clippers the game with yet another RIDICULOUS call... Chris Paul physically assaults Corey Brewer and yet, magically, Chris Paul is the one at the line shooting free throws. Well-called game, refs. What a #$%$' joke.
Commenter::They should cancel all the upcoming fakers game on holidays and award it to clips or wolves instead. they are more fun to watch than the boring LA fakers
BendGod::The Clippers will go second round & out with no inside game & just tossing up brick after brick that has built their outstanding past.
frank::don't Lakers fans have some merchandise and over priced tickets they need to buy instead of posting here? besides, who else is going to pay for Kobe's 33mil contract this year for sitting on the court side..
