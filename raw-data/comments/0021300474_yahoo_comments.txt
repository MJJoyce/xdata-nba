Cindy::just 1 game , heat couldn't get close enough to hip check curry . heat shot enough free throws to win , great spacing for warriors , make heat run and play reckless , but keep outside shooters free , don't drive to basket because that is where heat hatchet job you . if you hit those 3's the heat have to make an extra basket every other possession to keep up .
Michael::LeBron has 8 turnovers, Wade & Bosh, 15 for34, Big 3- 10 total rebounds and you expect them to beat who?
fernando::what a victory for GS...good going, and the heat will be okay, it is a long season and anyone that expects them to win 70 games is crazy....they are favorites still but it is a long season, so let us stay in the moment, right now the warriors did fantastic! (remember they did get beat by the clippers)
Fred::Awesome games from the Warriors! Heat fans, don't despair since it takes a near perfect game for the Warriors and an off night for the Heat to get this outcome... so  in my opinion Miami is still a much stronger team... granted playing in second division makes it easier to rack up wins.
douglas G::David Lee's stats tell the story, 13-17 from the field, and 14 rebounds, no threes, he's playing great low post game.  Don't know who defended him, Lebron or Battier, but someone isn't playing good D.
Logic::DLee10 is the best PF in the NBA. Best skills in the paint and a top rebounder. He absolutely schooled Miami all day long.
C::Once again poor rebounding is killing the Heat.
MIKE THE ECONOMIST::Heat have a hard time matching up with the warriors on the defensive end.  This could be their worst possible matchup in the Finals.
Guest::Dwade confesses love child, time for Lebron to do the same with the Cleveland newscaster. Then they both can feel better.
moseb::Thanks Davidson:  I agree!  Golden State can really shoot the ball from outside, however, they just can't stop anyone else from scoring.  Their biggest defensive weapon is Mark Jackson.
