Tex Rubinstein::Portland needs to shake off the loss last night. They beat themselves by missing open shots and throwing the ball away without any pressure from Sacramento. Play with the intensity they showed in the 4th quarter and MOST games will be blowouts. The way they started the game last night reminded me of last year's Blazers (the ones that lost 13 in a row to finish off the season) with nobody wanting to take a shot, running out the clock, and either taking a bad shot or turning the ball over as time expired. Hopefully Lillard can continue what he started last night in the forth quarter. Show the rest of the team that it's FUN to make baskets and get defensive stops.

Joe::Jameer Nelson, when are the magic gonna get rid of the reason they lost their chance at a championship a few year back, what a waste, not a team player and a real ball hog
Boydree74::What is the record, for a single team starting the SAME FIVE PLAYERS in consecutive games?  This is amazing, nobody has missed a game, or a start, this year.  That is why the Blazers are doing so well....CONSISTENCY.
