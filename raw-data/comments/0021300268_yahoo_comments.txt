RAY B::Was a Casey fan but if the Raptors have any intention of competing, he has to go. They have had so many of these meltdown quarters that cost them games. Not taking anything away from GS, but if your a Raps fan you know what Im talking about. They must decide ASAP if they want a playoff team or Anthony Wiggins!
RICHARD THUG SHERMAN::Going into the 4th quarter Toronto was up 25 versus the spread and failed to cover by 2. Ouch.
DOC::Looking at the Raptors faces at end I actually felt bad for them.  However for us that is the kind of win to proper us into another road trip.  The assists are telling 17-27, one crazy hot front running team to a team that worked itself to a W.
PKM::Have a nice flight to Canada.
SNW::lol turned it off late in the 3rd, but checked the score mid 4th 'just in case' and all I have to say about Toronto is:   LOLOLOLOLOL dam!!
john::Toronto's shooting at this point 59% from the field, 54% from 3-point. The Warriors need to learn to play defense on a regular basis, or they will be toast in the Western Conference. I agree with the other comments, it is the coaching staff primarily that is suspect.
Anton::PLEASE INVESTIGATE Toronto Raptors and Golden State Warriors for game fixing and/or TANKING. This kind of sports crime shall not go Unpunished! INVESTIGATE BETTORS as well!
Anton::As usual Warriors are Pretenders, not Contenders.
Steven McCormick::The GSW was favored to win this one 74% to 26% . . . How does Mark Jackson justify the first Quarter  loss like this one and subsequent 26 point deficit in the game . . . I'll be he'll stick in that Draymond Green . . . then the GSW can completely lose the game.
Green'S Rams::I hope your plane crashes, Toronto.
