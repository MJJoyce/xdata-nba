tani_budde::Good game by the Warriors, my team has to figure out how to win games.
beefmongolian::Warriors should replace stephen curry for kent bazemore,stephen curry's just an average point guard.He try too hard to look cute!he's wasting other opportunity chances playing time.He's just like another Alex Smith nice guy but will never led the team to a Super Bowl.Eachtime stephen got score they always say its just an off night for him.He's always chew his mouth pieces like a kid!
demfour4::do you even watch basketball?
aj8707::i'm sick of the bay area teams always having to fly under the radar, what do we as fans have to do to get some national media attention around here? seems like whatever we do is never good enough to enjoy the spotlight. warriors are finally good this year and we get maybe a 30 second spotlight on sportscenter and then its over? dang i hate this east coast bias.
eric-bledsoe-666::same  here -chris paul
I3UTTON::"wahhhhhhhhhh"  -you
Pr0ject_sky::Barnes really needs to step it up. He has all the talent to be great but, sometimes i just see him standing around. Man needs to create his own shot, he can almost take most SF off the dribble but he just seems to scared to let it fly.
john-GOAT-amaechi::david lee is a stud muffin &lt;3
OaklandRaiderFan2105::A win is a win.  Good game Hornets.
Just one mans opinion::Great game.  Warriors did what it takes to pull out a win.
Pr0ject_sky::Question: lets say for conversation purposes both the Warriors and 49ers complete the trinity year. Who is the face of the city? Baby  face slugger Buster Posey, Quarterback CK7,  The Golden Boy Stephen Curry or other?
dsphillips100::It would be the warriors as a team. It's the only NBA team in town so the entire Bay Area can rally behind them.
yippykyaymf::agreed warriors don't rep SF
NorCalRams::dont refer to kaepernick as CK7. it sucks not being able to say such catchy things as RGIII or CPIII but being so unoriginal and not creative by taking the number he wears and putting it after his initials. And the be fair, im a rams fan and i hate when fans refer to S. Jackson as SJ39, its just dumb.
Just one mans opinion::From an outsider Hornets fan....David Lee.  If the warriors go all the way, DLee would have to be a monster for that to happen.  Niners have been on the verge for two yrs, warriors winning a title would be a shock to most bball fans.
pickolick13::Buster Posey
Just one mans opinion::Props to warriors fans.  Every other board Ive been on recently has had a bunch of numbskulls.  You guys are a good group that talks ball and not $@%!$@%!.  Good win fellas and I hope the warriors continue to kick a s s
DoubleV1369::im going to miss you Hornets fans. i look forward to the rematch!
LightsGoDownIntheCity::good post, GG
WFan5::People doubting Bogut will be back idk why. Freak injury. What I wonder is if he will STAY healthy
Richardcurrier::I dont think there is enough sample time to say they were better with or without him. He didnt play much when he was on the court. But I would think, jsut having a skilled big body, would enhance this team. That being said, who knows if he will come back
yippykyaymf::If its not broke don't fix it. The warriors have proven they can win with a small lineup. honestly the offense looks better without him
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Lee 1 board shy tonight, damn shame
WarriorsWarrior::Great Win Boys!
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Bay Area teams are alive and well right now....except for my Sharks(fu.ckin strike)
Richardcurrier::And the Raiders suck pretty much now too
aj8707::if games are not to resume by mid-january there will be no season :/
PartyInTheBackfield::NHL needs to get their s.hit together
LightsGoDownIntheCity::They are so incredibly divided at this point with players playing in leagues overseas, I really dont see it happening
PartyInTheBackfield::i mean at this point, will there be any 2012-2013 season?? Heard games are cancelled through december?
LightsGoDownIntheCity::seriously, it will continue to destroy a growing fanbase
WarriorsWarrior::Sayin David  Lee is underrated Is a understatement!
beefmongolian::Stephen Curry is suck!
Just one mans opinion::All fans who follow the league know Lee very well.  I, for one, was not surprised tonight.  Looked like David Lee to me
supe540::Weird stat:  Anderson 28 pts no rebounds no assists no blocks no nothing except points.
Just one mans opinion::Its weird, he has been rebounding well
supe540::Sorry, 1 steal, 1 turnover.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::perimeter shots all night
terpsravensmavs::I haven't followed the warriors much this year, but if Lee is like that consistently, wow
vivalacorbo::lee is a stud! team oriented, hard working. loved him on the knicks. the warriors look legit! getting rid of monta ellis was the best thing they ever did. too bad they couldnt get a few more draft picks instead of bogut. i don't think he'll ever get healthy enough to make a difference
WarriorsWarrior::Agree.  Leader too
Just one mans opinion::Lee has been a beast for four yrs
WFan5::All Star look at the #'s
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Lee&gt;Griffin
agidius::Klay Thompson is AWESOME!!
PartyInTheBackfield::starting to get over that debacle vs the nuggs where he missed both free throws down the stretch. That was painful to watch
PartyInTheBackfield::yeah no doubt. Hes only human. Heard he left the arena with his uniform still on. So he took it just as bad as any fan. I respect that
agidius::Happens to the best of em.
WFan5::Warriors have so many weapons right now, talk about a complete drafting turnaround
terpsravensmavs::vasquez is steppin up these past few games  by the time gordon is back, he may be at his best and the hornets will start reeling in some wins
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Pelicans potentially the worst team name in sports history???
vivalacorbo::suns? there aren't even multiple suns in the universe
sheevu21::You can't be serious?!
srvblues650::LOL
CGraceIII::Guess we can write off Aminu. He seemed like he was finally developing early in the season too. Great athlete but terrible judgment and ball handling.
Just one mans opinion::Aminu has been playing like he just got a big contract.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Now if the Dubs could just pick up a W from the juggernaut that is the Orlando Magic then I would say GS is for real
supe540::That ship has sailed.  They're done with them for the season.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::thats prob a good thing
WFan5::or Denver lol
LightsGoDownIntheCity::I feel like they have our number every single year
WFan5::I was at that game. Refs nearly gave it away!
LightsGoDownIntheCity::We beat the Nuggs, only took 3 tries lol
TheJTram::Look on the bright side, the Hornets/Pelicans went perfect from the line. That's pretty good for a young team
WarriorsWarrior::HorniCans
WarriorsWarrior::No one saw this comin. DON'T LIE!
WFan5::Going to be shouting Waarrriiiooorrrssss all night tomorrow. Kings fans will fight it at first but be home by 9
PartyInTheBackfield::thats the thing, you wont see many kings fans there.
WFan5::You may be right now that everyone knows the Maloofs will be moving the team
PartyInTheBackfield::man when i was there last year for the warriors and kings. The place was half empty. Was there on sunday, the upper decks were empty
WFan5::nah they actually do show up, Sacramento doesn't have many options for entertainment
LightsGoDownIntheCity::17-8 and the Dubs keep rolling, we've been pegged as a 7-8 seed but right now the Warriors are looking like they belong with the big boys. Waiting to see a matchup with some of the Wests power houses with the confidence that the Warriors have gained from that roadie
vivalacorbo::they are very good. knicks fan here but i root for the warriors on the west coast. i'd say it's OKC, LAC, Spurs, Memphis in one tier, then you guys, denver, utah in your own little "great at home" tier.... and the lakers will eventually get into that tier but lose in the first or second round. good luck
Richardcurrier::Great at Home Teir, ummm did you happen to see the last road trip???
WFan5::they beat the clippers at home fyi
WFan5::Clippers in LA too
WFan5::Miami in Miami wasn't too shabby
Moski87::Proud of the Hornets/Pelicans. We play hard every night. Anthony Davis was a beast tonight.  Good Game Warriors.
Moski87::I rep my team win or lose. We are young and have to learn how to close games. Eventually N.O will get it going.
supe540::You sound like a great fan.
PartyInTheBackfield::Have to go down and beat the kings. Tired of them beating us in that cow town
Just one mans opinion::Proud of the hornets.  Still two years away but they fight every night
Just one mans opinion::Weve been blown out a couple times but usually these guys keep it interesting til the end.  I love watching AD grow as he learns/sees everyone in the league.
CGraceIII::Adding Shabazz next year will help.
Just one mans opinion::I may be wrong but Im still not entirely sure we will have a top pick.  We have two rookies starting and a team that hasnt played together that is showing improvement.  Perhaps a 5-7 pick and I dont know how much that will help.  Maybe Trey Burke, but we need help at every position
CGraceIII::TheJTram - We need him too ya know &lt;.&lt;  What position will he play in the NBA?
TheJTram::We need him too ya know &lt;.&lt;
WarriorsWarrior::^ good fan!
OAK619::Yeah they have some nice pieces. Big men, and some guys who can shoot from 3. Nice inside outside potential.
Oaktown1029::17-8, wow, lol.
WarriorsWarrior::Luv it bro
Oaktown1029::word. it's funny.
Timdiz85::Hornets or should I say "pelicans" are suprisngly decent considering their record. gg NO, you guys are scrappy as hell and I look foward to a rematch
taste_teh_reinbo::Hopefully once Gordon comes back and stays on the court the hornets will start to win some of these close games. Also as much as I like vasquez and he's played extremely well the hornets need to trade for a legit PG. vasquez is just too slow and turns the ball over too much.
gsraider::Goodnight San Jose
PartyInTheBackfield::goodnight palo alto
gsraider::Goodnight San Francisco
LightsGoDownIntheCity::had u by 11secs
WFan5::Bogut comes back healthy this team is scary good
CGraceIII::No one in the NBA is scared of GS. Enjoy your improved team and hope to make the playoffs. Curry is fun to watch and Green looks like a nice rotation player.
beefmongolian::Stephen Curry is gay ! got no moves always need a screen to get shot and take so many shots just to get 15 pts.Oh I forgot its just his night off again!
WFan5::David Lee and Klay Thompson aren't bad either :D
CGraceIII::Don't get carried away.
WFan5::don't pretend when when you're last to admit it
F.C. Medicinal::Scary good CGrace remember that
gsraider::Goodnight Oakland
WarriorsWarrior::good night Santa Cruz!
LightsGoDownIntheCity::goodnight san francisco
LightsGoDownIntheCity::this game was the ti.ts
PartyInTheBackfield::Man im still pissed about Brandon Rush's injury. He would be a great part to the bench. Freaking randolph
supe540::That play looked dirty to me but no one talks about it.
WarriorsWarrior::Dirty maybe but  Not intentional
PartyInTheBackfield::yeah i think it was. Randolph was crying after, you know he knew he screwed up
SB4LlFE::win even when the starting backcourt sucks horribly tonight
supe540::Real nice game Hornet fans.  Some excellent young talent developing.
Emperor00::This chat room got real annoying really quick. Good game Warriors. Geaux Hornets.
Jeffharwell::warriors fans do not talk "trash" but we do hype our team up and appreciate a change in culture... warriors fans are far and away the best fans in the nba. sellouts even when the warriors have 20 win seasons.
taste_teh_reinbo::funny how fans of teams that perennially suck seem to come out of the woodwork and start talking trash once there team starts to show promise.
RickeyHenderson2008::fortunately warrior fans had the lakers game to be concerned about or we would have trashed talked more on this win
WarriorsWarrior::Gg
LightsGoDownIntheCity::There are no rules!!!!!! theres 1 rule!!!!!
WarriorsWarrior::good game faithful NO fans
RickeyHenderson2008::can the bobcats make this a great night now?
trevorcabo::11-4 run in last 3 45 of the game. NO is talentless trash
CGraceIII::Best two players on the floor tonight. Just not enough help yet.
taste_teh_reinbo::pretty sure any team in the league would kill for anderson or davis.
Bruno5654::lost by .5 wow this always happens to me :(
nin3rs07::DAMN I HAD WARRIORS -7.5
Hale8633::If Lee sinks that other free throw the Warriors cover the 7.5!
Bruno5654::it sucks and i lost the 2nd hal bet to :( it always happens to me
Raiders Godfather333::Great game Hornets! Your time is coming.  GO WARRIORS!!!
madmikeymike::HORNETS COVER HORNETS COVER HORNETS COVER
GeorgeTownDC29::Woah didn't notice Richard Jefferson hiding on the Warriors bench. A little nostalgia.
Oaktown1029::Green's play has relegated RJ to the bench.
PartyInTheBackfield::Damn now we gotta go down to sacto. We have trouble in sacto for some reason
Oaktown1029::Good game Hornets, give it some time, you'll get better. We've been waiting forever. :)
CGraceIII::Warriors twice as many FT attempts as NO.
