Wasp::Kendrick Perkins - 1 rebound, 1 basket, I technical. Why is this guy starting??
Rodney G::Boy, its a good thing OKC traded Harden.  If OKC had kept Harden and traded Westbrook, they would probably be undefeated right now.  Harden is a beast and is playing better than both Westbrook and Durant.    The NBA got lucky with the Harden trade; otherwise, OKC and Miami would be in the finals every year.
Anton::Career low 3 FTs for Durant...
Eric C::No disrespect to New Orleans, Thunder win easy. Save some for the Pacers. THUNDER UP!!!
PKM::This could be a high scoring game.
Charles::wow they are four games back, from the top. I smell a upset
Diego Ptz::westbrook
- LJ::kobe ftw!!!
Ghetto Genius::Blowout Pelicans lose by 15
kgdkdsk jgrjfgjd;fl::The great team player Russell WestBRICK (LOL) must be really depressed. Ya, his team is going to win, but Durant had a much better game tonight.
