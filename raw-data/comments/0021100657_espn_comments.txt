gunda man::why the hell do the hornets want to trade C. Kaman? Thats the only thing they have going for them.
whatsdoing::now that howard ain't coming...  nets blogs are a ghost-town....  with the Doors "This is the End" playing in the background..... apocalypse now!
yorkallday::the real big 3? scalabrine luke walton and kwame brown http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/p/best-nba-memes.html
CandySparker::Wallace Lotta Love!
Sina S::As a Mavs fan I should have seen this game with next years starting center in Chris Kaman &amp; next years starting point guard in Deron Williams!!!
zachrlee::I'm glad to see Belinelli get this much playing time and production. He was the Euro league's MVP, known for his sharpshooting skills and all-around game.
msuspartsnumberuno::I found a betting system called Sportsbettingstar a couple of months ago. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I found this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. Its a double down system and is by far the best system I have followed for betting in years of betting on sports. Posting this for anyone that is looking for a legit system to win money on your bets
netsbucs::to much hornets fans talking sh*t, let me put them in check. First u say "y would d-will want to play for the nets" etc. At least he's there unlike chris paul ;). Next we still have a better record than u. another we going to Brooklyn. Nobody  wants to play basketball where the whole town only wants to see Saint's games. Another half of ur roster is filled with players that the whole nba doesn't give a sh*t about. If anything the Hornets are the laughing stock of the league. I mean at least we ain't last in our conference. Now the hornets fan can S.T.F.U. Now i can start my new hash tag #FireAvery
jdrman2007::roll up a blunt or somethin dude. Looks like you've been stressed and i suggest finding a way to calm down before you have an aneurysm

captainmafia::Next year, the city of Dallas will have the Deadly D's (Deron and Dirk)
DonTeflon357::Nets can go o-82 n I'll look at you like this ish gravy
SCastillo504::Belli in ya bootay...SPLASH...::poses by your bench with hand in air::
chucknorris32311::WHY DO THE NETS STILL EXIST ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????/
Purp-n-Yellow::I swear for a min I thought the celtics were play on in Chicago right now
metropolitanfanforever::Deron can't wait to get out of town but Billy King is somehow  very confident that he can sign him....lol
drftw42134::Fire Billy King!
23duck23::3 quarters to 1  yes?
23duck23::Did the new jersey jets win? is it over?
23duck23::Damm they were in my bet an all. Let me down the stupid fuks. I hate basketball.
SJYankee1::LOL THEY MIGHT AS WELL SIGN MARK SANCHEZ AS PG.
stockstud13::they got their @ss kicked
stockstud13::ehhhhhhh... what?
Purp-n-Yellow::Hornets 2012 champs
KeMvP277::how about that. Hornets can only win on the road.
KeMvP277::Na they've beaten some good teams on the road. Minnesota, Phoenix, Cleveland, Milwaukee, New York, and Denver.
cubbiesrule1672::actually agaist everyone
benga4lebron::only against the nets
SJYankee1::LOL NETS LOSING DERON WILLIAMS NEXT SEASON. ITS GOING TO BE EMPTY AT BARCLAYS NEXT SEASON.
benga4lebron::not unless they do a sign and trade with pau, better than nothing lol
drftw42134::Fire Billy King!
metropolitanfanforever::YES!!!
springfresh33::NJ??? LOL
cubbiesrule1672::chris kaman is the best player on the hornets discuss
Ireland297::Marco Belineli has really steped it up this year... I think hes underated..
Spiz_BC::LOL @ the Nets!!!
Purp-n-Yellow::Gustavo Ayon MVP
cubbiesrule1672::look at the top performer
cubbiesrule1672::kaman mvp
benga4lebron::D-Will, go to the Lakers and win, you deserve better.
metropolitanfanforever::This was suppose to be a star of a new era.. for the Nets with Wallace...lol
CrespoJavi::what has kanter done lmfao
robsing316::what a great move it was to send a first round pick to portland for wallace!!
robsing316::double that raise for the fact that he traded favors and the pick that turned out to be kanter.
metropolitanfanforever::Of course ..Billy King deserves a raise for that move..
drftw42134::Its official.  You guys will not see me in the Nets conversation board until the Lakers game
metropolitanfanforever::Wow a lot of good Gerald Wallace did.....
Sportsafficionado::No but seriously wtf....
chucknorris32311::you give up 30 points to your 12 in 4th to lose the game when you were in control........... ya this team sucks prolly worst in NBA ;)
GoldenGopherfan is done crying over gophers tough OT loss::dwill is too fat to play good in the 4th....hes tired
benga4lebron::how the hell do you lose to the lowly hornets at home?
Rezo201::LOL have a nice evening everyone, go $@%! yourself, King!
chucknorris32311::omg nets suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
benga4lebron::offseason prediction:  1. dwill goes to dallas 2. dwill goes to LAL via sign-and-trade
metropolitanfanforever::The problem is not that how can the Nets only score 12 points but  how come they can't stop the Hornets from scoring 31? Everybody goes into shooting funks!! But that is when your D is suppose to kick in but Avery is a crappy  defensive coach.....FIRE AVERY!!
drftw42134::Fire King first! He is the one that hasn't given us $@%! to get better.
Rezo201::D-Will is looking very Lebron-ish.
GoldenGopherfan is done crying over gophers tough OT loss::netshave the most overrated PG ive ever seen and no talent hahahahah 10 years of losing coming
robsing316::Just think of how good the nets will be when D-will leaves!!
Rezo201::Not trading D-Will at the deadline will go down as one the stupidest basketball decisions in the NBA in many years. King set this franchise back 4-5 years.
benga4lebron::they should've took Pau, or got involved with houston for some pieces. nets are garbage, king should be fired.
crimson-knights123::Agreed, and trading away a lottery pick was pretty f*cking dumb.
robsing316::not to mention what he gave up to get Deron!
robsing316::agreed.  and the draft pick, which ended up being Enes Kanter is looking pretty solid too.
Thurmonaaaterr41::Yeah Derick Favors is a beast in the making!!
crimson-knights123::how do you only score 12 pts in a quarter? How the f*ck do you get outscored 28-12 in the last quarter on your home court? WTF&gt;?
metropolitanfanforever::foot was on the line folks!!
benga4lebron::Nets are garbage, and to think D12 wanted to play here.
Sportsafficionado::wtf man wtf
drftw42134::Very sad.
Rezo201::LOL first 3 attempt all season and he makes it. We are cursed, that's all.
