thegrizzman89::wow this was a Lintastic game!!!! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Sean Joh::I will be back once Jeremy Lin is a truly All-Star. Stay tuned!
oj_rocks32::jeremy lin is a beast!
BBFocus::Someday this season or next one, I expected Lin would get his first triple double (10+ in points, 10+ in rebounds, and 10+ in assists, and 5 blocks and 5 steals) somewhere...
BBFocus::Someday this season or next one, I expected Lin would get his first triple double (10+ in points, 10+ in rebounds, and 10+ in assists, and 5 blocks and 5 steals) somewhere...
OK_U_S_A::Lin will probably play for Japan in the Olympics.  When he is done, I hope he stays there.
Enki of Nibiru::Gee...the Knicks are a .500 team. I guess for Knicks fans this *is* something to celebrate. I would say that the Heat will destroy the Knicks in the playoffs...but we all know the Knicks will not be in the playoffs! New ESPN headline for next Heat-Knicks game:  "Sizz-LIN Heat Torch Knicks."
jint2915::KNICKS WILL BEAT THE HEAT 95-87 ON THUR
cwruhsk5::well, if you were 8-15 a few weeks ago, then getting back to .500 is something to celebrate.. let's just say it's a step in the right direction.
OK_U_S_A::Jeremy Lin before he was a pro.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVWMsUaByqo
jint2915::FOR HELM'S DEEP
Vader562::Remember Fort Sumpter
jint2915::REMEMBER THE ALAMO
Enki of Nibiru::It was a GREAT day!
Vader562::Lebron vs. Lin in several days......  ;)
OK_U_S_A::Pearl Harbor, never forget guys!
jknyc1::guys, this tool is troll. ignore him and he'll go running back into his sister's arms
cwruhsk5::put it this way.... If Lin gets to play in the Olympics, he'd be wearing a USA jersey.
tjsean81::Japan is a place not a race so yes Lin is Asian. The sad part is Lin is an American just like you are.
MarkusGrahams::Bob Marley's father was White. So really he is both black and white. Bad example.
OK_U_S_A::Saying Jeremy Lin is not a Jap is like saying Bob Marley wasn't black!
cwruhsk5::I see you logic.. you are saying all Asians are responsible for Pearl Harbor........ man.... I don't even know where to begin........
Enki of Nibiru::That makes NO sense. Man, you must have picked up the REALLY good crystal meth at middle school today.
tjsean81::Ok_USA you my friend are the reason i am glad the north won the civil war. You and Pretty Boy should get a room so the two of you can have your racist rants together.
cwruhsk5::Lin is not of Japanese descent... get your facts straight before posting something
Vader562::Forget what? :(
jint2915::I LOVE THE SWAGGER THAT THESE KNICKS ARE PLAYING WITH THESE DAYS
Vader562::YEs!
Vader562::Linsanity!
cortzone::.
jint2915::THE LAST TIME I WAS EXCITED FOR KNICKS GAME SPREE WAS BALLING FOR THEM
OK_U_S_A::I think the Nba should keep the game American with just American players.
jint2915::WELL MY EXCUSE IS I DONT WORK TODAY AND IM BORED HAHAHA
jint2915::ALL THE BEST WHITE GUYS ARENT EVEN AMERICAN  DIRK- GERMANY NASH- CANADA MANU- ARGENTINA PAU- SPAIN BOGUT- AUSTRALIA  AND I KNOW MANU AND PAU ARE SPANISH
terrapin3dixon::Who is the bigger idiot? The guy who purposely makes ridiculous comments JUST to get folks rowled up? Or the folks that take the bait and argue with him?
jint2915::WELL IF WHITE BOYS HAD SOME SKILL WE WOULDNT HAVE THIS PROBLEM
cwruhsk5::it's not Lin's fault that he's the best PG in his team... what's the coach supposed to do???
OK_U_S_A::Racist comment!
cwruhsk5::Where have been for the last two decades?  Now that an Asian guy is playing well, you just want American players in NBA..... . . . . .  unbelievable...
OK_U_S_A::All I was saying is that the NBA needs to bring back the white basketball players,  so I don't have to watch Dr. Wong from Law and Order play pg for the Knicks.
cwruhsk5::Why don't we just let the best player play in the best league in the world??  So, you want an NBA version of "Affirmative Action".. hahahaha
jint2915::THE INTERNATIONAL LIST IS ENDLESS
jint2915::APPARENTLY CLINT EASTWOOD FROM GRAN TORINO IS ON HERE RIGHT NOW
jint2915::THE GAME HAS GONE GLOBAL, DIRK, RUBIO, MANU, PARKER, MUTOMBO, HELL EWING WAS JAMAICAN
cortzone::Hakeem was'nt too bad either.
cortzone::Hakeem was'nt  too bad either.
jint2915::OK LIN IS AMERICAN HES FROM CALIFORNIA. MORON
cwruhsk5::wow.... don't even know how to respond to that.... i guess you win......... . . .  .
OK_U_S_A::It's not like they killed all of them.  The world is way overpopulated anyways.
cwruhsk5::I see... why don't tell that you Jewish people and see what they have to say?
OK_U_S_A::They weren't that bad.
cwruhsk5::that was Japan.  Lin is of Taiwanese decent..  It's like blaming French for what Germans did.. by the way, according to your logic, what should we do with Dirk?  Should we excuse what Germans did during WW2?
Vader562::R.etardo! :)
Vader562::Can't hold Jeremy Lin responsible for Pearl Harbor.
cortzone::Get over it, they have.
jint2915::OK I SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING YOURE AN IDIOT END OF DISCUSSION
OK_U_S_A::Jeremy Lin might have been born in the USA, but that in no way excuses what his people did at Pearl Harbor!
cortzone::LMAO, tell him Jint. "even a fool appears intelligent when silent". Ouch.
jint2915::THE NOTORIOUS L.I.N. IS LEADING THE WAY
cortzone::Enough is enough, I guess I was going out on a Lin here.
cortzone::Who is Tim Teebow, sincerely Jeremy Lin.
cortzone::Who is Jeremy Lin????? Sincerely Tim Teebow.
jint2915::SO THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PLAY 4 QUARTERS.  -TIM TEBOW
cortzone::HAHAHA LMAO that was good bro.
cortzone::Hopefully someone can challenge Miami, Knicks have sucked since the 90's maybe they can mount a charge. Philly will fold, and unless D.Rose can play 48 minutes per night and ever get healthy, w/o him they are"nt even in the discussion. Celtics are done and Orlando is a headcase. Indiana looks decent and never know which ATL. team will show up.
MerseDaddy::Knicks were great in the 90's.
cortzone::"We make a lot of money but we spend a lot of money", sincerely Patrick Ewing.
jint2915::I CANT WAIT FOR A KNICKS-HEAT PLAYOFF SERIES. JUST LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS. KNICKS IN 6
cortzone::Yeah I agree, even though I loathe all NY teams, it just seemed to be more fun when they were relevant.
jint2915::KNICKS ARE GOING 27-7 THE REST OF THE WAY
jint2915::THE KNICKS WILL BEAT THE HEAT 95-87 ON THUR
cardsownthecuse::Nope
Tontos Redemption::Philly coming back down to Earth. They could very well finish at .500. They have 20 of their last 33 on the road. Knicks will get the 3 seed.
cortzone::Lots of talent, but I think reality will eventually set in and realize they are still Philly.
D-Nice891::If Wade remains healthy..I see the Heat going on a 12-15 game winning streak at some point and separating themselves from the pack
jint2915::HATERS LIN CAN BALL!!! SO LEAGUE WATCH YOUR BACK!!!
OK_U_S_A::I must admit, I was not a big fan of Jeremy Lin because of that whole Pearl Harbor incident, but after watching him play I realized he's a pretty good pg.
bedareds2002::I must admit, I was not a big fan of OK_U_S_A after reading this comment because of the fact Pearl Harbor dealt with the Japanese and Lin is of Tawainese and Chinese decent, but after thinking it through and realizing this poor guy is only a litte bit racist I realized he might be a pretty good guy.
OK_U_S_A::That's your opinion!  I'll stay with the facts.
bedareds2002::All these haters need to stop with the "it's all because of the system" talk.  Was it the system that made Lin hit clutch shots against the Lakers, or the game winner against Toronto or the clutch shots over Dirk and Marion against the Mavs?  And if the system is so good why didn't Douglas or Shumpert excel when they had the chance?  You all need to recognize Lin can BALL plain and simple!
88888Lin88888::real talk.
88888Lin88888::Jeremy should be on the USA olympic team, and he has a strong case to be the flag bearer.
jint2915::THE KNICKS WILL WIN THE ATLANTIC DIVISION THIS YEAR
oHHHcAMMM::No one said anything about Novak. He played out this world yesterday.
terrapin3dixon::Except for the headline that reads "Linn, Novak rally Knicks." Blind?
oHHHcAMMM::I hope Lin changes his name to "Shijie Heping"  (world peace in Chinese).  That will stop all the bad name games.   Lin is the best thing since Willis Reed's return in the second half!
PSUrocks55::"Sticks and Stones will break my bones but . . . "  Oh wait, I have offended someone!  LOVE how the Empire cut out/off the Comments on the Lin story but when the Sandusky allegations broke and JoePa died they let the ignorance FLOW from all the keyboards!!!  Great work Mother Ship!
jint2915::WELL SANDUSKY DESERVED EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID ABOUT HIM. CHILD MOLESTING SCUM BAG.
HuskrDood::Dear ESPN....No one that I know within 2000 miles of me gives a crap about Jeremy Lin. When can we expect a break from the droning on and on and on about him?
88888Lin88888::enough people care about lin that they fired a guy for using a common phrase such as ch.ink in the armor.
kurtgbbg::For anyone who didn't see the SNL skit on Lin here's a link (no pun lintended) http://www.rantsports.com/courtcrusades/2012/02/18/video-saturday-night-live-parodies-jeremy-lin-stereotypes/
jank6708::Hate to see how turnovers Lin will have once he tires.
bedareds2002::Then why don't focus on how many wins he has.
stone419::The knicks starting lineup includes 2 Ivy Leaguers, 2 guys that never went to college, and 1 guy that only spent a year in college. Now THATS diversity.
koolaid408::1 ivy leaguer landry fields went to Stanford PAC 12 but Stanford is the Harvard of the west
stone419::you're right i looked it up after i posted it and hoped no one would notice, hahaha. Still though, the difference in education is as big as it gets. I think it makes a good combo
TheSportsDude2011::Lin is an intelligent person. I bet he won’t squander his money like Iverson.
TheSportsDude2011::Lin is an intelligent person. I bet he won’t squander his money like Iverson.
donnie426::ESPN sucks you can't say anything but they can say racist things?
donnie426::Iverson didn't waste his money he just bought too many corn roll holders. Take that ESPN i said corn rolls not egg rolls
donnie426::Uh Wrong!! He just bought a nuclear egg roll factory
stone419::they make nuclear egg rolls now?
LebronNigJames88::Lebron James isnt getting enough coverage.
donnie426::Trade Lin NOW!!! while the value is still high!!
stone419::haha for who? unless its chris paul or Dwill no thanks
LSUManiacBR::Miami vs Cleveland in the playoffs????????????????????/ OH YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LSUManiacBR::West- San Antonio OKC Clippers Dallas Lakers Denver Rockets Minnesota
Tiznizzle12::This game was a bar fight.
kravadebela2::If Lin can get his turnover numbers down he will be a greater player for Knicks. He will just get better just watch this isn't just a moment .....@drzsmoto33 btw roomate's ex-wife brought home $21026 the previous week. she been working on the internet and bought a $537800 condo. All she did was get blessed and set to work the clues reported on this web site http://gooplu.com/1Hx
drzsmoto33::never said it was a moment....just saying if the turnovers go down and the assist keep going up the NY knicks might have themselves a Rondo
Tstrike29::With all due respect.. Rondo and Lin are not the same type of players.
The Worldwide Leader in Twitter Coverage::Still flagged
D-Nice 3.0::67largecharge Prove what...they are a playoff team and then lets see who they pick up in trades. ============================================  wait, you think they don't have enough????  Lin, Fields, Shump, JR, Novak, Stat, CHandler &amp; Melo... that's NOT including Baron Davis...  they don't need anyone else...
austuc33::u got chadler and stoundamire how many bigs u need
stone419::its a long shortened season. im not saying we need dwight howard, but if we can turn douglas into another big off the bench id be happy
stone419::another big guy would be nice too, but they look good right now
stone419::he is, but you can never have too many
D-Nice 3.0::Harrelson is serviceable... as a Rookie, and that's saying a LOT...
drzsmoto33::another good PG so Lin doesn't have to stay on the court for 40+ mins a game
Tstrike29::My concern is Davis' defense... He is kinda fat right now, and he will want to gun the ball.    Baron is a NOT a Steve Nash type of guy. But hey DAntoni brought him to the team... Must be something there.. smh
D-Nice 3.0::if B. Davis can spell him for 15-20 minutes a night, do they need anyone else? and if so, who would you trade?
The Worldwide Leader in Twitter Coverage::Baron Davis will be fine as a relief PG once he loses about 80 lbs
LSUManiacBR::Playoff Picture: East- Miami Chicago Knicks Celtics Magic Hawks Pacers 76ers
Redsockkiller4life::76ers should be 4th
LSUManiacBR::the cavs are gonna fade late. they are gonna fight for the 8 seed
stone419::imagine a Heat Cavs 1st round? it would be so awesome (until 5 mins into the first game when Miami is winning 20-0)
Sportsfanatic3379::I am assuming that Miami will be the #1 seed
The Worldwide Leader in Twitter Coverage::How the hell did the Celtics make it to 4? They're gonna be on the outside looking in. Cavs are playing better ball right now
The Worldwide Leader in Twitter Coverage::Turrible
Sportsfanatic3379::Celtics look awful
D-Nice 3.0::stone419 wade&gt; everyone? i hope you arent including lebron ============================================  i'm sorry... i know LBJ is having a statistically monster season, but Wade is the better player... if Wade never got hurt on '07, the Cavs don't make the Finals....  If LBJ doesn't screw it up last year, they WIN in the finals... Wade is infinitely better than lebron because of his mature approach to the game... LBJ isn't mature enough to win on his own...
stone419::the fact that wade was hurt wasnt exactly an isolated incident, it seems to happen alot. And wade is great and very smart, but LeBron can do things that no one else can. I think that the Heat without wade are better than the Heat without Lebron
stone419::ignore this
stone419::possibly but i would rather have Lebron than any other player in the league.
D-Nice 3.0::if you trade LBJ to the Magic for Dwight, are you still a championship contender?
mansonite11::If wade didn't get every call known to man he would be mediocre....
mansonite11::His board play is good because he always goes to the hole because he knows he will get a call.  He shoots almost as many free throws per game 9.9 over hs career as Shaq did during the Hack-a-shaq years 14.3.
drzsmoto33::Hater........his ball movement is out of this world.......and his board play is just as great
drzsmoto33::I just wish they could both player moster together
