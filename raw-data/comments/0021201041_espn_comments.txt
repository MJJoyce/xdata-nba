incognito302::33 wins in the 70's by the lakers was good, but I think they need emphasize the FACT that the ABA and NBA didn't merge yet, so the best players were not in the league yet. Example Dr.J, etc were still in the ABA. The Heat streak is better because of that alone. The best players are in the NBA now, and 27 win streak is awesome, even if they don't win another game, thats better than the win streak in the 70's
GetoverIt1273::This is what we've all been waiting for with Lebron for the past 9+ years.  It happened a little bit later than people thought it would, but he is truly an unstoppable force now!
305champsforlife::Can't wait to see the Heat hold that trophy up again.
sferg14::Heat Extend Streak To 26 Games Without Wade! WOW, most impressive win so far!!!!  Oh wait...they played the Bobcats.
Pass To Kobe And Prepare For Offensive Rebound::Bahaha, says the Portland fan!

KingDuro::haha see this guy knows
Theironrod2012::How is someone born with a thought without experience of it? I don't know anyone who was born a christian and knew all the commandments. I don't know anyone who was born with the thought that they wanted to have kidds like they parents without being taught through experience. So how is someone borned a homosexual? Are they really saying they was borned deformed? Because you can't be borned with a thought already without experience of it. Plus you have to be taught to be gay or striaght either from yourself or your parents or other people (you don't reach puberty until a certain age and people can't even reproduce until they are a certain age). A person does what they like because they was taught to like it from the experience they had with it.
Theironrod2012::Israelites are born Israelites through they gens and they dad  But christian are not borned followers of christ
All In Stitches::Dude, first of all, a person is not born christian... you are baptized to be a christian.
RyanD2014::the difference is I can be a sinner sitting in the dessert with no water and no one to witness my change of faith when i decide to invite the Lord into my life and accept him as my Lord and Savior, and God will recognize me a Christian and will save my place by his side for eternity. No need for water or a baptism.
All In Stitches::Theironrod2012 - I said I don't know anyone who was born a christian because they not. You can be borned a Israelite though. ========= I don't know anyone who was born a christian and knew all the commandments.  - this statement says otherwise...
All In Stitches::RyanD2014 - baptism does not make someone Christian.. Acceptance and repentance does. Baptism is only a public act to show one's new found clean slate. ===  what is the difference between acceptance and being baptized to be a christian? None...
All In Stitches::"I don't know anyone who was born a christian and knew all the commandments. " - this statement says otherwise...
RyanD2014::baptism does not make someone Christian.. Acceptance and repentance does. Baptism is only a public act to show one's new found clean slate.
Theironrod2012::I said I don't know anyone who was born a christian because they not. You can be borned a Israelite though.
