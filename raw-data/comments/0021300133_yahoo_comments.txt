Ronald::So Parker or Wiggins will definitely play in Utah. Kanter, Favors, Parker, Hayward and their injured guard would be solid.
Rebecca Black::The Jazz are depending on Richard Jefferson...they might as well add Antawn Jamison and Jermaine O'Neal while they're at it.
Be+::Should be an easy win for the Spurs but sometimes teams lose to opponents that they underestimate.
Steve Moore::For the sake of all things holy, fire Corbin now. Blind not to see Clark is best guard on the team, rarely plays, and lose, lose, lose. Lucas is worst player in NBA. cannot dribble, shoot, pass or make good decisions, plays ahead of. Clark. This will get humorous as losses pile up.
Kevin::Tony Parker is my hero
Bryan Jahnke::Tim Duncan got a technical??? how can that be???? Oh! Joey Crawford was officiating
Austin::I never under estimate an opponent just because their record is not very good, and I'm glad the Spurs dont think like some of the fans on here who dismiss the Jazz based on their record. Utah is never an easy place to play, no matter who the Jazz have on their roster.   Thats being said, Go Spurs Go.
Devin H::Paul Milsap is a 6th man for Atlanta...Utah would be drastically improved had they kept Paul and used him as a 6th man..
The Sports Authority::Spurs are 9-1?!?!? Wow. That's just how veteran they are. I've seen some play this year and they looked like they're just trying to get their legs under them. But there they go again.
Anton::Jazz by 30.
