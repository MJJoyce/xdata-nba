thelexmeister::I'm sure someone has said this, but I'm not going to take the time to read through 4300+ comments: sure, as a Kings fan, I'm not going to say that was a great season. BUT we started and ended the season with wins over the Lakers! Wasn't all that bad! (And don't tell me the only won last night because the starters didn't play - I don't care - a win is a win - as I said, I'm a Kings fan - we have to take what we can get!)
Forever KINGS::<b>Anytime, we beat the Lakers, 'It's a Good Thing!'... :-)</b>
smaakattaak::more hill, ebanks and goudelock and less mcroberts, murphy, and blake.  brown needs to take a page outta pop's playbook and use more than an 8 or 9-man rotation....
thegameisback1591::Why is andre miller still in the league he has no ankles
ViLLeLaker13::"bra i stay on TrollMode"-G.Buttz
ViLLeLaker13::jesus..GrapeButtz is still Trollin'
.boom.shaka.::And on a positive note, the Lakers finished the season winnin 10 of their last 14 (or 15?) road games....and that includes this blowoff game.  Definitely a good sign going into the playoffs.
inglewood247::i was glad that most of the starters didn't play; rest is always good for playoffs. With us playing Denver high octane, fire power run and gun we will need the rest.
.boom.shaka.::It was very selfish of Kobe to not play and deprive the trolls of most of their material.
ustna::Whoa! Was Kobe planning on a raping that game??!!
ustna::haha...nice
.boom.shaka.::Yes, but the Kings would have gone to their "happy place"
inglewood247::_ I sure hate to say this but:   _Lakers win series...........4-3; Denver is scary out.
grapenutz78::Wilt......MJ.......DURANT!!!!!
shaqatastic::Would have been a disgrace for a 43% FG shooter jacking it up to win a scoring title over a 50% efficient scorer like KD.
shoepimp01::How does my @55 errrrrr 5th Ring taste?  - Kobe
The_Devlin::Not everyone can win the scoring title shooting 58% from the field like Shaq.
winters999::did you have these complaints when iverson was winning scoring titles?
ustna::yep
Bueno477::kobe is the SECOND best player ever. http://bit.ly/JRTuow If you think aobut it, it's tru   bird retired after 16 seasons, kobes still unreal in his 16th season   magic johnson admitted kobe's best laker ever   KOBE SECOND BEST
polobaby37::I disagree........as a b-ball fan-----I say KOBE IS THE best ever!!!(sorry mj)
Visionz311::LOL
PhatmanXL::Best Laker ever?   Kareem?   Wilt?   Bueller?
winters999::he for damn sure is better than bird.   bird got three titles playing with two hall of famers kobe got five while playing with one other hall of famer,  (shaq then  gasol) they played same number of seasons and kobe has 7500 more points  kobe has 10 all defensive appearances to birds 1.
.boom.shaka.::LOL...players may be stronger and faster, but Free Agency and expansion has spread talent out to the point that the NBA is VERY thin -- some may call that "parity" but I call it "mediocrity".  Not to mention the "no touch" rules that would have allowed somebody like Bird to get to the line even more.  Kobe's a great player, but let's not get too crazy
Mazyck2003::and an idiot.... Bird was never a good defender. Bird could shoot the lights out know doubt, but with the players of to day it would be more difficut for him because he lacked speed.  That's not saying he wouldn't be great, because he would but to compare him to Kobe is remarkably stupid.   The NBA was great back then, and people always try to go back to the past, but players or different today, stronger and faster...just like the computers we use and the cars we drive...time and progress doesn't stand still, neither does professional players of any sport.
The_Devlin::You must be bringing character, leadership and willingness to play as a team into the equation.
.boom.shaka.::I've seen all of Kobe's career.  I saw all of Bird's career.  I'll give the edge to Bird.  And yes, I'm a Lakers fan.
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::STUPD F*CKING POST
The_Devlin::No, but he's top 10 and that's nothing to be ashamed of.
ustna::lol....sure buddy
Swimbikeron::I see the Laker scrubs shot 45.1%, still better than Kobe's 42.9% season average.
DidYouSeeThat36::Try again, Laker guards shot. Blake 1-5, 20% - Goudeluck 4-12, 33%, Morris 4-10, 40%, Sessions 6-13, 46%  Total guard play 15-40 for 37.5%
winters999::shot 45% in a loss.  amazing how haters can hate and kobe did even play.
drawitall::I'm shocked that Kobe didn't go after scoring title and did  the right thing in resting........ Great JOB by a true leader and captain ! I got this one wrong !!
The_Devlin::I figured he would probably rest.  There was no guarantee he would score 38 points and if he went for it and didn't score he'd look pretty stupid.  Good decision by Mike Brown, Kobe or whoever is calling the shots over there.
The_Devlin::Kevin Durant wins the scoring title for a third year in a row.  That guy is an offensive beast!!!
DidYouSeeThat36::When he first came in the league to the Sonics, I thought he shot way too much for a rookie...But, I've actually grown to like his game.  I still hope they lose.
JK Belvi 2008::Lakers will not get past Denver - too much scoring, too slow on defense and MWP out.
ustna::Agreed they are way too athletic and quick for the old Laker legs..
Tim Duncan Professional::Lakers are a mess. Sessions ans Ebanks starting in the playoffs? lol
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::pssshhh haha thank you Sacramento for letting the Cavaliers get the 3rd pick!
sport medic::So we now know the Spurs bench is significantly deeper and more talented than the Lakers.
sport medic::I don't know about the whole season because their bench play was not that good at he beginning of the season.  Talent acquisition and talent development this season has been impressive.  Their ball movement has been especially good.
The_Devlin::I think most people have known that for the whole season unfortunately the starters play heavy minutes in the playoffs so a deep bench is not as big of an advantage then.  Spurs also get a lot of open 3's and empty lanes to drive during the regular season.  Everything is contested in the playoffs.  The SPurs, Thunder, Lakers, Clippers and Grizzlies all have a legit chance to win the west.

antistratfordian.::explain
antistratfordian.::Why would they struggle?  They didn't struggle to close the season - if they played their starters they would've won 9 straight - and LeBron has been playing the best basketball of anyone in the league to end the season.  Again, the Knicks are 0-3 against Miami and Melo doesn't know how to win in the playoffs.  Easy series victory.
Chip_Douglas_69::If the heat win it will take them 7 games to do it. they arent gonna turn the switch just like that, they will struggle.
antistratfordian.::Melo is 6-24 in the first round.  LeBron is 24-6.  LeBron does not lose in the first round.  Melo has lost in the first round 7 out of the 8 years he's been in the playoffs.

Hollerationatory::"Kobe time" was a half hour special on public access tv. I missed it too.

PrizeBull69::join the club bro :)
xxxhawk::"allows Durant to win"????????????????????????  kobe has only scored 38+ in 6 games this year &amp; only 2 on the road.  kobe is notorious for playing badly on the road.  kobe would have to take 40-50 shots, if then.    Durant hit over 50% of his shots &amp; 5/7 3pters in last game for 32 points.  could kobe do that on 23 shots, hardly.    Durant shot 50%fg for year &amp; 38%3's.  kobe shot 42.9%fgs &amp; 29%3's.  kobe took hundreds more shots than durant or lebron but they both scored more points.  kobe did not allow anything....  kobe just pulled the, I'm better but wouldn't play card".   Pathetic
Martin Rodriguez677::Kobe could put up 38 almost every night, on worse shooting. 6 years ago he could have put up 45 a night but Jackson reigned him in.  Even if he only put up 25 every night, count up the number of times a team loses a given game on a given night by a margin less than 25.  Then, know youre an idiot.
Jason_ninenine::shut up
xxxhawk::Sorry, didn't mean to burst your delusion.
