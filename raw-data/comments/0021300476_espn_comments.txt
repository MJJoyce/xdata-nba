Justin Jenkins::In the last 2 seasons Joe Johnson is 12-14 in the clutch.   Like it or not, Joe Johnson is the most clutch player in the NBA right now.
Shanny Salcedo::Joe Johnson:"I get paid to go 1-10 and make the game-winner"
John Gray::Still a W. haters gonna hate.
Mike DiDesidero::13 pt faves without Westbrook. Yeah OK, NBA.
Jabari Akil::You can deny it if you want to, but Westbrook feeds this team. KD needs another player alongside him to succeed. Just like LeBron. Look at how many easy shots he gets with Westbrook on the floor.
Corey Ledford::Westbrook can't come back soon enough. Late game execution without him has been truly, truly awful. Pathetic.
Jake Pool::Durant can't do it alone and the defense was pathetic in the whole second half.team is garbage now
Cambry Moddelmog::A loss to the Blazers, a top team, and 2 point loss to a floundering Nets team that needs wins in a bad way, and they are garbage now? Give me a break. It's gonna take a few games for them to get over him being out, especially late in games because he was so ball dominant. They'll be fine.
Jake Pool::Zero defense in the 4th.way to let the worst team in the league win in your house and Durants disappearing act in the fourth
Shawn Bento::I turn the channel for a few minutes to watch OU beat up on Bama and I turn back to see another 4th quarter collapse?
Stephen Donahue::More like 2nd half collapse..!
Meron Foto::Yesssss-------- Lets Go Blazers.
Adam Youman::weird. i didnt know the blazers played in this game
Meron Foto::Adam Youman  You know what I mean..... don't act d*mb now. Its always good to see a division opponent losing :)
Adam Youman::Meron Foto i also dont understand why you put the star in for dumb
Bazil Koby Martinez::the  nets   suck
Jeeves Sritharan::they need to move back to NJ
Jake Pool::Looks like another classic okc home meltdown against a garbage team like toronto
Daniel Maresca::Granted, try losing your top player and see how well your team does, and if the Nets suck, what does it make your Team?
Jake Sherwood::I think KD will win the MVP this season if Midwest (Westbrook) is out long enough (not that I want him to be, he is a great player and a good person). KD won't have the percentages that he had last year, but his numbers (points/boards/assists) are going to be too big to ignore and he will look better if they can stay in the top 3 out West because the West is so strong and Lebron's East is so weak. Obviously LeBron is more efficient (outside of FT), but I think KD can sneak this one away from LeBron. It will be hard for KD to get past ESPN and other media outlets, but I think the gap between he and LeBron is getting smaller with each 30/10 game that KD has. LeBron is amazing and one of a kind, but I think KD is too. Thank you for reading.
Jake Sherwood::LeBron is a better defender also, but I think KD has put a far better effort into defense this season even if he doesn't have great Block/Steal numbers.
Fiti Bear::nah man there are two other guys  who will win MVP   and they will win all this year  Lillard or LMA
Brett Skinner::Toughest looking game winner I've seen this year.  Tip your hat to Johnson on that shot with Ibaka all up on him.  Just a suggestion but with Westbrook not complaining about any pain after his most recent injury, I suggest you get rid of your MRI and X-ray machines.
Luke McCoy::I guess you didn't see Damian Lillard's game winner vs the Pistons this year.
Brett Skinner::I did but I was factoring in Ibaka vs Stuckey and Lillard Half step closer.
Patrick Oliver::Scott Brooks does everything backwards. When the game is close need to have Lamb/Jackson/Durant in there to score. Once you get up 10+ throw Sefo and Perk in there to defend the lead...
Yon Bevans::KD need to stop going cold in game when it matters 36 points in 3 quarters and 1 in the fourth not good dont get me wrong Im all okc night and day also K Love may even take scoring title this year go thunder K D for M V P just stay hungry effort effort effort
Noah McArthur::It wouldn't have been that bad if he didn't miss that easy jump shot that Ibaka tipped to him.
Adam Youman::Another lack-luster game from reggie jackson. proving over and over again why he should stay in OKC and come off the bench for RW
Ayn Bland::I like your thinking.
Marcleen Bavogui::true.. they miss RW williams went for 29.. dont he would`ve done that if westbrook was guarding him
Justin Daniel Gower::Ayn Bland funny how you hover around the spurs board when your team can't even beat BKN
Patrick Oliver::Think Scott Brooks forgot he has Collison...a whole 6 minutes tonight
Bobby Magers::That sums this team up without Westbrook!  Maybe next year Thunder...
Andrew Boutie Bouton::You act like his season is over
Shawn Bento::Uh, he's not out for the season...
Laurel Spitzer::He will be back by March hopefully for good!
Treyvon Carter::durant better get bashed as much as Lebron did on the heat-warriors board
James Belandres::looool okc sucks  how many parlays did this game break?
Marcleen Bavogui::2 straight games of stinking the joint in the 4th...
Bazil Koby Martinez::they   suck k g   and  paul  pierce  go   home
Laurel Spitzer::WESTBROOK>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>durcant
Patrick Oliver::He is 8-14 with 24 points...not sure how that is struggling...
Jeeves Sritharan::no
Samuel Fisher::Amazing, Brooklyn hasn't lost since going small.
Patrick Oliver::Deja Vu Thunder fans? Until they get someone that can manage rotations better then a 4 year old kid they aren't winning anything
Al-Jaleel Sawab::JOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Patrick Oliver::Here we go again. Start of the 4th and have the whole bench on the floor. Need to put this game away, THEN put the bench in to clean up at the end...
