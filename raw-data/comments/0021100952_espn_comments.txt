robertbark01::zebras are hard to beat down the stretch
jj232830::First JJ now Harden, any time a bench player helps their team beat LA he gets attacked by a Laker.
BYUrepublican::Kobe Bryant 8 assists = W
Meet-The-Forkers::suspended infefinately.....
Meet-The-Forkers::metta is an desendantf african nations gang bangainis a $@%!$@ kick mett in the balls
Michael38061::Why do crazy people go after the ears?
Michael38061::This was the worst thing I ever saw in the NBA since watching it in 1967, besides the intentional elbow that Karl Malone put to Isiah Thomas, 40 stitches over the eye/concussion. These players are not safe to be around. Artest should be dropped from the league. He could have killed him
Michael38061::Rodman and Laimbeer are other examples
chiefsfan716::He was just celebrating, his eyes were closed anyways.
SoonersTheDestroyers::Your nuts!!!
Michael38061::Wilt Chamberlain knew his own strength. That's why he developed the finger roll, to keep from hurting other players. Even when he dunked the ball he was precautious of that. This guy World Peace wants to hurt somebody because he's crazy like Tyson
chiefsfan716::Naw, hes alright, just a bruise
chiefsfan716::Kobe
SoonersTheDestroyers::Metta World Peace(puss)  is a total piece of $@%!!  S-h-i-t!!!
Michael38061::He's nuts
chiefsfan716::Kobe= G.O.A.T
bryck77::It's funny how some of these team convo's have hardly any comments but the Lakers boards are always filled with haters.  I guess Barley was right nobody boo's the bum
AceVenturaMavsCoach::you know what the best part bout the 2nd and 3rd rounds of the playoffs is gonna be?? The fact the Lakers won't be there
LAKERSareTRASH::Simply put, NBA is full of high-testosterone plays and circumstances and when a guy dunks it you want to slow down his celebration right?  Or he'll back you down like a bit.ch, right??  What Harden did by getting next to Artest was a basketball play.  Go to Youtube and review dunks and what happens afterward.  What Artest did was a reaction beside his celebration,  Artest meant to hit whoever was there, maybe not in the head.....i'll leave that to chance and debate.  Given his track record, and I know that people will say this is extreme, I think he should be done for the remainder of the year.  It wont matter though, besides their last regular season game.........LAL will only play 4-7 games after that.  This is a story of a guy who tried to distance himself from who he TRULY is.  THUG.
Tommy1387::Kobe out played durant overall 26 points 8 rebounds 8 assist
mrblu24::You must be on drugs or something
AceVenturaMavsCoach::Durant made more shots and scored more points. Kobe just got by on the refs
Supaman116::AceVenturaMavsCoach - Durant made more shots and scored more points. Kobe just got by on the refs  So who was more clutch in the game... Kobe or Durant? That's right... K-O-B-E!!!
1871jupdog::THE SPURS OWNED BOTH TEAMS THIS SEASON !!!!!!!
mrblu24::I own your mom for life #beatthat
Pinkycuh::I like how LA thinks they are the better team....especially since they won 1-3 games between these teams. I want to see you win this 7 game series.
mrblu24::it's funny bc i think we own both teams in the playoffs.  Deny that.
chiefsfan716::its dead in here
squidward tennis_balls::It was just an accident we are sure that world peace won't mistake harden for a terrorist again
The Three Point Wizard::comment on this if kobe is good
Inconvenient Truth::Harden got in the way of my 2nd favorite of rons  celebrations. maybe 3rd. the bicep kiss is first, blowing a kiss to the crowd is 2nd and beating his chest like a gorilla is probably 3rd. he did it a few weeks ago and it was awesome/hilarious. i thought we were in store for a great celebratory performance again and BAM, KO. Harden bumped into metta on purpose and got was he had coming. maybe that will teach him to instigate stuff as usual. its not right cause its against the rules, but maybe it taught him to stop his stuff
SoonersTheDestroyers::Hold still $@%!$..  I'm going to take my elbow and make an attempt to detach your head from your body.
squidward tennis_balls::I just watched the replay and i am really worried........is ron artest's elbow okay?
Inconvenient Truth::im saying ron was wrong, but dont act like a litte itch, provoke a guy to get him mad, then act like omg why did he hit me?  CAUSE YOU MADE HIM MAD
Inconvenient Truth::alicia limehouseTHAT DOESNT GIVE YOU HTE RIGHT TO HURT A PERSON- SUCK IT UP AND SHOW HIM OUT BY PLAYING YOUR BEST IS WHAT U ARE SUPPOSED TO DO ========================== Inconvenient Truthi never said id excuses it. I just said he always does it to get under peoples skin and this time it worked. only it cost him a KO and maybe some missed time, oh and a loss. hope it was worth it
Blakemg1::alicia, with that mindset maybe you're one of those women who shouldn't watch sports.
alicia limehouse::YEAH ILL STICK WIT MY CELTICS
alicia limehouse::IF U DONT CATCH MY DRIFT.. LET ME TELL U I DONT CARE U CANT HURT PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT
Inconvenient Truth::the bear had just dunked on the leading shot blocker in the nba silly
alicia limehouse::WELL IF THE BEAR DIDNT SUCK-SLEEP SO MUCH- IT WOULDNT GET POKED
Inconvenient Truth::jesus christ, apparently u dont get MY drift...i know that he should have hurt him, but have u ever heard dont poke the ffing bear??
charlie_sheep::Not a single interesting game today
WatEvasCleva24::hahaha EXACTLY
kobe_clutch_bryant::Kobe locks down westbrook on defense ...he shoots 3-22  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXU8_kxeGHo&amp;feature=g-all-u&amp;context=G267bb3eFAAAAAAAAUAA
Tommy1387::IT wasnt team defense KOBE SHUT WESTBROOK DOWN
Blakemg1::haven't watched the whole thing but I loved it. They played great TEAM defense on Westbrook and Durant both. but it started with Kobe being in his face on every shot and forcing him to either take contested jumpers all day or drive toward the help.  All in all, great execution of the game plan. And a combined 14-56 for KD and Westbrook is the result.
Inconvenient Truth::ron was wrong for that if he did it on purpose, but i mean, harden knows what hes doing, he ALWAYS does that, he'll go and get in your way or bump you to try and get under your skin. well this time it worked. boom....KO. was it worth it harden? like people say, "you ffing with the wrong one"
alicia limehouse::THAT DOESNT GIVE YOU HTE RIGHT TO HURT A PERSON- SUCK IT UP AND SHOW HIM OUT BY PLAYING YOUR BEST IS WHAT U ARE SUPPOSED TO DO
Inconvenient Truth::i never said id excuses it. I just said he always does it to get under peoples skin and this time it worked. only it cost him a KO and maybe some missed time, oh and a loss. hope it was worth it
alicia limehouse::CELTICS= NBA CHAMPS
charlie_sheep::I agree with you the celtics will be the eastern conference champs
Blakemg1::in 2008
alicia limehouse::OH THAT WAS CUTE-NOT!- DONT BEA HATER
AceVenturaMavsCoach::I root for a team who has gotten by on getting beneficial calls I root for a guy who wears a number 24 which represents how many shots he takes per game I root hard when we injure other teams players I may or may not be a bandwagoner I usually bring up constant stats and make fun of lebron after we lose  What kind of fan am I??  Care to take a guess
mrblu24::I wonder who you root for? And why are you even in this blog? Oh yea bc the Lakers are the most hated team in the NBA.
Tommy1387::a championship fan
AceVenturaMavsCoach::nope. I'll take bandwagoner, laker fan, idiot,
kobe_clutch_bryant::idiot.
AceVenturaMavsCoach::Well actually the answer was laker fan but idiot is close enough
alicia limehouse::I DONT CARE...ARTEST AND BYNUM NEED SOME SERIOUS HELP..THE LAKERS SUCK AND WILL NEVER BEAT MY CELITCS ESP. NOT IN THE PLAYOFFS
mrblu24::S*** the f*() up alicia. Last time time I checked, the Lakers beat the Celtics in in their last playoff meeting. So get your c*&amp;^ filled
alicia limehouse::I think somebody needs to calm the hell down
alicia limehouse::Sorry i was jus Tweetin and i Tweet in all caps to make my followers mad
_walnuts_::Nobody cares about you. Get over yourself.
charlie_sheep::alicia turn off the caps,calm down  and everything will be fine
ilovekobe2death::LAKERS WON THAT GAME WITH 3 BENCH PLAYERS IN THE GAME. ANDREW AND SESSIONS ALONG WITH BARNS NEVER CAME BACK INTO THE GAME.
Tommy1387::The REfs didnt give nothing Kobe took it it shows Kobe can win with anyone Bynum isnt special if he plays lazy he will be replaced good move by brown to yank bynum
ThaBlackMambaaaaaaa::aceventuramavscoah= tool
AceVenturaMavsCoach::the refs gave you 15 fts in the 4th
WatEvasCleva24::Harden had it coming, he was trash talkin all Last game at OKC
Blakemg1::I'm not saying he deserved to get clocked in the skull.... but I for sure don't feel sorry for him. I would have gone for the ribcage maybe. But he's been asking to get clocked with an elbow somewhere. He's obnoxious.
alicia limehouse::SO ITS OKAY FOR SOMEONE TO GET HURT B/C A GROWN-MAN CANT HANDLE A LITTLE TRASH-TALKING? I DONT THINK SO
AceVenturaMavsCoach::laker fans are heartless
alicia limehouse::IM A DIE-HARD CELTICS FAN I HHAATTEEE THE LAKERS ARTEST JUST MADE ME HATE THEM MORE... NOW IM REALLY GOING TO STOP WATCHING LAKERS GAMES(UNLESS THEY ARE AGIANST MY CELTICS)
Tommy1387::y do u watch them in the first place i dont watch the celtics games
ilovekobe2death::Down goes the bearded man  with one hit KABOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tommy1387::BYnum is the blame for the first three losses if he played with as much heart as jordan hill did without crying for more touches an losing the ball out of bounds the lakers woul be unstoppable
ilovekobe2death::WE DIDN'T EVEN PUT BYNUM,BARNS OR SESSIONS BACK IN THE GAME WE WON THAT GAME WITH JORDAN HILL, BLAKE AND EBANKS
Pinkycuh::So who did you blame for the 1st two losses? Since LA is so superior.
alicia limehouse::U ARE HEART LESS ARTEST WAS JUST MAD B/C HARDEN WAS MAKING HIS TEAM LOOK DUMB. HE KNEW IT WOULD BE THE ONLY WAY THEY WOULD WIN-
WatEvasCleva24::ur forgetting they where up 18 without him
dave19741997::Harden is way better than that washed up artest anyway.
ilovekobe2death::What meta did was cool and hero like its the best thing I ever saw need to happen more
SoonersTheDestroyers::You a piece of crap!!
alicia limehouse::ARTEST HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DIRTY PLAYER HES THE REASON WHY I DONT LIKE THE LAKERS- WELL HIM AND BYNUM WHO IS ALSO A DIRTY PLAYER
ilovekobe2death::Kill the head and the body will die
alicia limehouse::ARE YOU CCRRRAAAZZZZYYY WHAT HE DID WAS DIRTY
dave19741997::Hope somebody does it to him intentionally
ilovekobe2death::What u guys forgetting is that kobe lives for the post season he will dominate I like how kobe got off the post and was doing pick and role expect a lot of that in the playoffs
mrblu24::Noooo you must be a dumb celtic fan. Watch the Lakers go beastmode in the playoff. Your celtics might make it past first round, just MIGHT.
alicia limehouse::NO HE WONT HE SUCKS! GET IT THROUGH YOU HEAD ONE MAN DOESNT MAKE A B-BALL TEAM ESP. NOT IN THE NBA WHEN THEY WILL FACE SUPERB TEAMS
alicia limehouse::I DON'T LIKE METTA' HES A DIRTY PLAYER AND HE IS SOME-TIMEY WHEN IT COMES TO CONTRIBUTING TO HIS TEAM
dave19741997::ron artest is a punk
alicia limehouse::I HATE the MAV'S they put pure shame to the word DEFENDING-CHAMPS its clear they dont know what a REPEAT is?
AceVenturaMavsCoach::Lakers are so bad that Hollinger doesn't even have them ranked in the top 15
Tommy1387::Hollinger is so bad he has LEbron wanked number one player even tho lebron never wins rings
charlie_sheep::if you like and believe in hollinger so much why don't you marry him? fa ggot
ilovekobe2death::Reason why lakers will win it all if these things happen   #1 kobe finds balance with scoring and getting teammates involved.  #2 bynum dominates the match up vs the spurs and okc.  #3 kobe shoots a high % Round 48-49 %   #4 kobe takes quality  shots .  #5 team defense.
Tommy1387::BYnum isnt a factor in the wins hes too lazy but we got a replacement in Jordan hill
alicia limehouse::#5 they all go to therapy b/c Metta aint the only crazy guy on the team
mrblu24::Your mom is their therapy session
AceVenturaMavsCoach::matt barnes thinks he needs more tattoos
ilovekobe2death::wwhwhat iI mmemean with getting teammates involved he has to trust  the bench.
AceVenturaMavsCoach::yea because bynum was so sick yesterday. Wrong. your a chode
hapatino::they are doomed then.  I only see #2 of potentially happening.
Clippers.Are.Better.Than.Supercuts::BENCH?
alicia limehouse::I KIND OF FEEL SORRY FOR THE BLACK MAMBA- I MEAN IM NO LAKEERS FAN BUT, IF HE WANTS TO EVER WIN A CHAMPOINSHIP AGAIN- HES GONNA HAVE TO EITHER SWITCH TEAMS. OR CONVINCE THE OWNER TO GET RID OF ALL THE CRAZY PEOPLE  IN THEIR LOCKER ROOM
mrblu24::Or convince you to shut the fu** up. he got 5 rings so far n i think he did it without your advice you dumb celtic fan.  I want you to jump off a bridge when Kobe gets ring #6, okay?
chiefsfan716::Since Jordan. Top 3 1. Kobe 2. Rose 3. KG
hapatino::Laughable
alicia limehouse::YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND! i lik Rose but u taling about best players since Jordan(the best) there definately are a few guys way before u would even conisder ROSE-hes way too young
AceVenturaMavsCoach::real playoff preview  WEST Spurs vs Jazz, thunder vs Mavs, Lakers vs Nuggets, Clippers vs Griz. Winners = Spurs, Mavs, Nuggets, Griz.  East  Bulls vs 76ers, heat vs knicks, pacers vs magic, hawks vs celtics. Winners = Bulls, heat, pacers, celtics  2nd round = spurs over griz, mavs over nuggets, Bulls over celtics, heat over pacers,   Conference finals - Spurs over mavs(for now till i see more) and Heat over Bulls  Finals heat vs spurs = toss up

AceVenturaMavsCoach::we been close every time and we blew them out once this year when our team was healthy. if Harden is still injured who saids we can't win?
charlie_sheep::you are saying the mavs will beat OKC?? you are stupid and you are also on drugs
AceVenturaMavsCoach::you saying the heat or spurs have no chance at being in the finals?? Your stupid
AceVenturaMavsCoach::is that why I have the spurs in the finals?
Clippers.Are.Better.Than.Supercuts::Nobody cares what you say After you said the mavs will make it to the finals.
Clippers.Are.Better.Than.Supercuts::Lol mavs fan living in the past thinking Vince carter is in his prime.
bullschitown33::Kobe best player since Jordan...and I watch Jordan play since 89..
chiefsfan716::Rose is behind Kobe
charlie_sheep::mavs(the worst nba defending champs) = first round exit
ThaBlackMambaaaaaaa::Lakers- 3 &gt; Mavs- 0
hapatino::OKC is 0-6 against playoff teams since their April 1 home win over Chicago.  Now that they are toast to get to the Finals, who will play the Heat? San Antonio?
Clippers.Are.Better.Than.Supercuts::Who said Miami is going to the finals?
hapatino::The East is pretty set. The West, I dont know.
Clippers.Are.Better.Than.Supercuts::Bench should be   Blake Barnes Ebanks Hill Gasol
ilovekobe2death::My name says it all. Who wants to war with me
mrblu24::Your mom is old but her toooschii still gets the job done. By the way, the old guy shut down Russell and was clutch against OKC.  #tellthattoyourowner
