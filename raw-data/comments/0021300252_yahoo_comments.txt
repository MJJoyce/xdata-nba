Boo_Boo::Guess who would be the happiest guy(s) if the Heat lost today? ... ? ... ? ... The betting companies, and those behind the scene!
fcbonilla::Amazing come from behind win for the Heat. Charlotte,  wou brought your A game.
DC::What's kind of funny about this is that statistically, Chris Bosh is actually the most clutch player on the team. Don't believe me? Look it up.
I State Facts And You Get Mad::Bosh finally showed up... He was MIA for the past 2 weeks
I State Facts And You Get Mad::Why does LBJ never play defense... You ever notice how they always get these big leads when LBJ is on the bench but once he checks in, the lead disappears...  They are shooting 55%, they should be up by more than 3 points
Tom::Beasley must play more.He has a potential to be great.
Guest::Lebron is back in the game. Let the fouls begin!!!
THE REAL DWIGHT::heat is so overrated
Homer Fudd Jr.::1 point win over Charlotte? Must have been a Miami brain fart kind of day.
ric::but heat might choke to bottom feeder teams so but i say cklose one
