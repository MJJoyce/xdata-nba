Notta Lespn1::Good job Buck(the Bulls sista team) And the trailblazers will get no break from the bulls tomorrow night! just like that.
Notta Lespn1::where are all the west conf dominance headz at?
d_bokk::The record superiority of the West is superficial. Every time Eastern teams play out there, they're literally playing basketball games at what would be midnight back home. Western teams traveling East are playing games at about 3pm-5pm back home.   Seems a little obvious that the West is going to walk out of that with more wins.
Milwaukee Bucks...::if gustavo was just a little bit more mobile he would be a solid 15 minute player
Toddthegod789::Portland Trail Blazer fans......It's about time to put on the cone of apathy
BillWaltonsHair::already wearing it!
bringbackjimmy09::Stotts is a Moron.  why are the the Starters playing 43+ each?  why are we not playing our young guys to get get more playing experience?  Its always been about next season so why are you trying to play us out of a possible decent bench player in the draft?  Stotts should be fired before the season ends so he can make history and become the 1st coach ever to be fired 3 times( for him straight) during his 1st full yr with a team.  #DONTHIREREJECTS
BaySports 1.1::It's a huge mess.  He has no clue how to utilize rotations.
58rhodes.3::Blazers suc
sworthin117::Blazers have a bunch of sissies guarding the paint.  No one will put a body in front of anyone.  In fact, they move out of the way.  Especially you Hickson, Mr. Giveup.  You can at least go for a block every once in awhile.  And you Aldridge, Mr. Halfass-jog-out-to-your-man-with-your-arm-halfmast.  Why do I see every Blazer stand around with a bewildered look on their face while the opposing team grabs the rebound and putback?  I dont know how Stotts doesnt lose his $#!%.
Kobelies247::Allways next season Portland! :)
49ersGoat::LOL, Clippers are struggling with the worst team in the West, I knew you'd be here. :)
Kobelies247::I know :( i cant win either way.
sworthin117::Correct
Bala88::Yes! Go bucks!
gmfwilly::https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sports-Talk-247/117187401796701  Come talk sports with us here!
sjohnson2013_08::ROY is fading away
Miller Park After Dark::PROST!
michaelriggle::Why doesn't Portland play their bench. They need to play there bench
Bad_pi::If the bench were to play more we would lose by 90 pts
Dingo Dave 33::Whats up with JJ. His stats have been off this past week.
rusticulis::They've adjusted his minutes. When he came over he was the 6th man. It looks like he's now behind Dunleavy in the rotation. His minutes have been down a little bit.
DuWayneSmith97::BULLS ARE DA BOMB DIGGITY
jakeprimetime::MONTA HAVE IT ALL
KswizzyD777::boylan is revealing sanders moves !
CrewDeBrew22::Was Illyasova injured or something?
CrewDeBrew22::Nevermind, I figured it out
CrewDeBrew22::LLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG???????????????
CrewDeBrew22::Changing the subject here, but can't wait for Brewers opening day in approximately 11 days
DuWayneSmith97::GO BARCELONA!!!
15and20::Go tigers!!
CrewDeBrew22::wow another heat bandwagoner
b.fochs::we started out slow, it looked like we were going to sneak into the playoffs last year, either way we'll be in the hunt
b.fochs::I feel good about this season
CrewDeBrew22::I know.  but thats what I felt last year too.  don't know  what to feel now...
wec123ker::Lillard has to be the worst defender in the league.
Bad_pi::I thought Caleb ran the defense. I like that they kept him but he doesn't know defense. For us to do better next year we need a much better person in control of our defense
Dingo Dave 33::And Stotts is not a Defensive guru!
Dingo Dave 33::Lillard is a poor defender, and when other guards penetrate as easily as they do, it breaks down the entire Blazer D
lester4586::not true ellis is a better defender
nomorten::Lillard has time to learn to be a better defender. Blazers did not pick him up for his defense. He's not the worst though.
marklenz24::Jennings
Solarvirus20::There are for sure worst defenders aka Monte Ellis.
R1P_C1TY::8 pts in the 2nd quarter and 38 in the 4th.... -__-
BayArya::1.5 points away from my 6 team parlay. don't gamble kids
WiscoMase23::jj never looked at her once during that interview lol
CrewDeBrew22::who?
WiscoMase23::redick, during the interview with sofia
junoNCAL::he has a girl, he doesn't care
WiscoMase23::true, that is important
CrewDeBrew22::WiscoMase23-  He probably has other things on his mind,  i.e. how his girl is going to bang him after the game
WiscoMase23::yeah but it made it really awkward. i mean there was no eye contact or anything
KN_WisconsinFan::a hott girl
sportinyeah::yoyooyoyo
milw-jay::A win is a win is a win, but, to go from 27 lead at half to only a 7 point lead with a minute and a half to go , is , disturbing and unsettling. But, the Bucks are a jump shooting team, 3 pt shooting team really, so,  big leads tend to come and go with this team.  Sigh.
Kobelies247::LA = FF  Fadeaway FAIL!
nomorten::Young team like the Blazers with four rookies and a new coach, it is not surprising they are failing. What's your excuse?
KswizzyD777::jennings is sooo full of himself sometimes... -.-
rusticulis::He needs to stop worrying about stats. I heard him say "I try to get 10 assists in the first half so I can be aggressive in the second." If you let the game play to you you'll be more successful. Shaq said "As soon as I stopped caring about stats, I started winning Championships."
b.fochs::All the time, dude is a pompous d.ouche
Brianhau529::Cool Blazers score 8 in the 2nd and 38 in the 4th; I think you need to be more inconsistent.....
junoNCAL::come on monta, why didn't you get the triple dub???
corknose::what a sickener.. had blazers +5.5, down and out at h/t.. then missing out by 2 freakin pts.. pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
corknose::shoulda pumped for denver.. (11pts..)
corknose::yes but your mum is charging extra these days so i am flat broke. 9 bucks a go.
KN_WisconsinFan::didn't you just win like 9k on the orlando game
Kobelies247::Pretty pathetic that even Portland cant beat these cupcake teams....
nomorten::The Blazers have by far the least producing bench in the league. Hard to win when your bench averages something like 16 points  a game.
nomorten::@R1P_City, About a week and a half ago one of the Mikes said the Blazers bench was averaging 16 points a game.
nomorten::It is a bad sign when 4 of the blazers five starters in in the top 40 of minutes played. Shoot, if their bench was averaging what the second worst Bench in the league is this team would be looking good. the gap between the Blazers and the next worst bench is big.
R1P_C1TY::is it even that much? wow. you'd think it would be closer to 10 pts a game or something
49ersGoat::Yup, and your starters are exhausted from having to play 40+ minutes all year
b.fochs::That's what every teams fans say when they lose to us #FearTheDeer if we're so bad, that makes you turrrrrrible (c) Sir Charles
BaySports 1.1::He isn't a fan of the Blazers.
CrewDeBrew22::Hows the Bobcats doin for you?
CrewDeBrew22::Thats how I felt about the Bucks for awhile
b.fochs::I respect Bobcats fans, its take a strong will to root for a crappy team
CrewDeBrew22::Ah.  sorry.  If they don't have enough balls to put their alliance, I assume they are fans of a crap team, i.e. the bobcats
49ersGoat::CrewDeBrew22 - Hows the Bobcats doin for you?  He's a Clipper fair weather... er Clipper fan
BaySports 1.1::2nd quarter Stotts had the entire bench in.  Look what happened.
WiscoMase23::the bucks are a cupcake? have you watched the nba this year?
CrewDeBrew22::'scuse me?
49ersGoat::Sic em Buck fans
BaySports 1.1::38 points in the 4th.  Thanks for finally showing up.
Kobelies247::This is what Portland does!
CrewDeBrew22::Hey,  I haven't seen Hairy and Heavy in a while.  Maybe he finally got a life
b.fochs::I thought I seen him make a cameo in the UW/OSU big ten tourney game last weekend
CrewDeBrew22::possibly
KN_WisconsinFan::probably jail
CrewDeBrew22::I hope forever...
KN_WisconsinFan::he beats his wife
KN_WisconsinFan::forever
b.fochs::lmao, misdemeanor charge of trolling
KN_WisconsinFan::hopefully jail
ddangelo87::you bucks fans are right...you might give the heat a run first round............
ddangelo87::maybe if they play portland every night...  lets face it, they dont hold a candle to the top 4 seeds
49ersGoat::I dont see that matchup happening.  I think the Bucks will get a 6th or 7th seed
sweet_lew09::monta ellis is a beast
49ersGoat::Nice work on the single-single, Ellis
Tripledan81::Double single idiot.
c.e.seliskar::21 points 9 rebounds is a single-single?
WiscoMase23::i am sure he is so disappointed by it
WiscoMase23::a win is a win, i guess
Kobelies247::NORTHWEST FAIL!
MTorres727@gmail.com::BLAZERS SUCH.Sweep baby!!!My bucks did it!!!
Edward4515::Imagine if the bucks didnt have a 20pt lead coming into the 4th.
corknose::you mean in some parallel reality.
frimpongdingdong::imagine if portland didn't shoot a 2k13 esque three point percentage
rrr2847::Frank Madden, go home, you're an idiot.
KN_WisconsinFan::You're a damn NBA players. A little half push isn't gonna send you half way down the court.  What a punk
ShadowH2::Dude, he was trying to draw a foul with hope still left trying to make a comeback, that doesn't make you a punk.
KN_WisconsinFan::Nah he was upset because he thought Jennings tripping was unnecessary
J-Tjuan::It kind of does.  It just makes you a smart punk.  LOL
ShadowH2::And you $@%!$@% won the game anyway, jesus, get some anger management.
ShadowH2::Damian with 86 minutes in a back-to-back, don't think he had his legs with him tonight,
MTorres727@gmail.com::sweep sweep sweep sweep
R1P_C1TY::Typical Blazers.... It's the same thing every night. Give up a sh.itload of points in the first half and get way behind, spend all of the second half making some ridiculous comeback, and then getting within 5 points and falling short. Every night, this happens, over and over and over.
greenandgold 804::ISH SMITH!!!!
49ersGoat::I gave up on the Blazers winning this, let's gooooo +6!
ddangelo87::ouch
Big Booty Smasher SWAG EDITION::According to my calculator the Blazers just need a couple touchdowns to seal the game. -Sent from my iPhone 6
CrewDeBrew22::Wow.  that is old school man. -Sent from my iPhone 24
onedmac::The 2nd quarter killed us.
