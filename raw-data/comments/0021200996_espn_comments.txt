Scottpilgrim32::Mavericks will be over .500 by the end of there 6 game home stand. Book it
CarlyJoni::Next time Mavs play Lakers, Cuban should zip his mouth and not incite MWP or Kobe into proving a point.
flankton::Mavs should sign D-rose
Strike 1 yer OUT::lol dallas mavs
This-is-easy::As crazy as it might sound,  I still think the Mavs have a great chance at making the playoffs.  After watching the Jazz play the Knicks tonight, I'm convinced that the Jazz is the worst team in the West and with no Kobe for the Lakers, it's very likely that we can take over the 8 spot.  If Dirk stays like the old Dirk, and with a healthy Shawn Marion, we can do it for sure.
CarlyJoni::You think?  The remaining schedule for the Mavs is not easy.  They have to beat teams like Memphis and Boston to get things going.  Also some help from the Lakers too.

TheMambaStikesAgain::i still love kobe   -dirk
joyhussain::Kobe has never beaten me in the Playoffs  - Dirk
TheMambaStikesAgain::Kobe is the greatest player of my generation, he has been the best since i came into the league    -Dirk
TheMambaStikesAgain::not hating just saying what dirk said
MTorres727@gmail.com::Why hate on Dirk when he complimented your boyfriend?
Zombie Jerry Buss::What happened why did ATL lose???????
HelloMyNameIsKendall::The Mavs scored more points.

MavUlous42::not even close
john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar::water is wet
fightingillini1243::love the name
NowitzkiHasAlwaysOwnedGarnett::what's the point in winning right now? even if we get the 7th or 8th seed, this team isn't talented enough to beat the spurs or thunder....doesn't matter how hot we are, might as well get the best lottery pick they can possibly get to use as a reloading piece, someone who might fit with CP3......
TheMambaStikesAgain::inuibnuinuinu
Sarge blocks your shot::john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar thinks having the best regular season record equals a championship.
-xCJx-::The Finals will probably be OKC and Heat again
LetsGoMavs-::I hate those 2 teams so I'm hoping for some unlikely finals like Memphis vs Pacers lol
ishnock::just get a center and unselfish-pg in the off season...and focus on re-signing mayo( very key). He is an unselfish player who sets up a lot of players, and he does not gun......  keep vince, dirk, marion, mayo, wright, collison( backup), crowder, and go from there.   this team has a lot of chemistry now, and they get along...stick to the plan cubes...stick the plan.
flankton::dallas needs to bring in a pure defensive specialist... i dont care if he cant shoot to save his life... just a shut down defender to help all these old scorers.  we dont need young scorers.  we have a ton of offense.  we need defense.
ishnock::I don't think marion is going anywhere . He is too valuable, and provides us with versatility at multiple positions
Sarge blocks your shot::Collison isn't selfish.
ishnock::collison is very selfish. I like him, but he goes for his shot too much...
john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar::mayo is garbage and no FA will want to come to dallas to play with a washed up dirk and a bunch of trash
LetsGoMavs-::says the spurs fan LMAO. You guys have to draft since no one ever wants to play in San Antonio hahah
LetsGoMavs-::I think Marion will be traded since his 10 million dollar contract hurts us in free agency.
flankton::dallas been playing well lately... almost beat OKC and SA... maybe next year they are a number 4 or 5
john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar::lol @ clueless mav homers having playoff hopes you guys are true morons
john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar::maybe not be at least we went further than the pathetic mavs
Sarge blocks your shot::You talk a lot of $@%! but y'all won't win it all.
Alex4ATL::gg fella's. please beat the nets for us. until next time
Sarge blocks your shot::GG
HelloMyNameIsKendall::Time to watch the Celts hopefully end this Heat streak.
Abner7716::NICE WIN MAVS HOPEFULLY THE SUCCEEDING GAMES WILL WIN IT ALL!!!
dallasmavs258::"TheMamba<b>Stikes</b>Again"  Another brilliant show of intelligence and smarts from another typical Lakers fan
flankton::Hope LAL lose
Sarge blocks your shot::That John Mayer guy only likes the regular season and the first two playoff series, then his team loses.
LetsGoMavs-::Now mavs need the Fakers and Jazz to lose
wreckem tech101::Nice just keep winning Mavs!!!
HelloMyNameIsKendall::Great road win.
jphilip13::The hawks have a winning record?
TheMambaStikesAgain::Sarge blocks your shot You must be a fan of one of the teams we $@%! on in 2011.     stop living in the past
TheMambaStikesAgain::you guys? lol thats weak
_Pyro27::Pretty ironic coming from a Lakers fan. All you guys do is bring up the past.
dallasmavs258::You need to go away and re-think your life
Sarge blocks your shot::No.
TheMambaStikesAgain::mavericks   -packing up to go fishing
john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar::tru
_Pyro27::Bernard James comes in and gets a block. Gotta love it
Sarge blocks your shot::^^^^^
wreckem tech101::Chris Wright sightings
wreckem tech101::123 got dang
john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar::when in doubt bring up 2011 even though your team sucks right now bring up 2011 if it makes you losers feel any better
-xCJx-::Yep I should surely listen to you because you know everything
john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar::spurs = 4x champs
LetsGoMavs-::Spurs = BORING
john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar::and more than likely your last
-xCJx-::It was our first championship so how could we not forget :)
Sarge blocks your shot::You must be a fan of one of the teams we $@%! on in 2011.
