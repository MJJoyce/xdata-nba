Hans Christian Zambales::a must win game against a good western team. Hope dragic keeps up the tear his doing lately and the other guys needs to step up!
Kevin J. Gulbransen::I can't decide if I want the Nuggets to tank or not. I think we need to move Miller of course, but I also think we should move Foye; he's not a long term part of this organization and his departure would open up time for Fournier and Q. Miller. Plus, once Gallo comes back we'll have no need for him and we'll have a bench of Robinson, Chandler(assuming Fournier starts if Foye is traded), Miller, Arthur and Mozgov. We should also move either McGee or Mozgov. I'm not completely un-sold on McGee yet, but I think he may be better suited to come off the bench and only play extra minutes when he's playing well.
Stewart Orvik::I really like this teams never say die spirit. Coach has them fighting to the end, every game. Can't ask for more than that. Also like the way he's working Len into a better player. Guy can coach...
Lance Denning::We're going to revamp the offense and sacrifice some wins to go further than the first round of the playoffs. Ahh, if we get to the playoffs.
Jim Patrick::At least you got to the playoffs. George Karl looks good at this time and the present so called coach looks pretty pathetic.
