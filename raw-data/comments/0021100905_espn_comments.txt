Rdhutchi::Best dunk montage I've seen in a while Check this out if you love dunks!!!!!!!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDc-di5kIek
legacyreaper32::Sad to see what has happened to the Wolves after Rubio went down.  Kobe has shown he can demoralize a franchise in ways other than scoring tons of points on them.
kraig31::lol timberwolves lol
nkruchten::You are a big loser Kraig.
Hmrstrm::Pacers are gonna wreck someones playoffs. Larry has built a nice team, he should be Exec of the year.
kobescored30butshot12for40::I found a betting system a few months back called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I found  this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it.Thought I would post this for anyone that is looking for a system that actually works
TubbyTime334::I just Want Williams to Reach his Potential!!! Hoping Randolph Finishes Season Strong Too.
jyetter247::Why LeBron will always suck plus alot more at http://yetterisland.blogspot.com/
log jamming::the wolves are legit....just hurt.
L.A.beanbryant::what an @ss kicking...the Pacers are Legit
TubbyTime334::Pacers are Legit but right now the Wolves have a WNBA Team out on the Floor.
yorklinks2::it annoys me so much when ppl say lebrons not clutch and kobe is cuz well... thats wrong  kobe shoots .300fg% in the clutch, lebron has a .400fg%  if their stats in the clutch were throughout the whole game LEBRON is way better:  LeBron: 33.2ppg, 15.1rpg, 9.3apg, .386fg%  Kobe: 36.3ppg, 7.8rpg, 6.8apg, .327fg%  check out an article about that here, proof lebron is more clutch http://bustasports.com/?p=784
Copious_Fred::lebron's rings really prove your point.
Hoosierhawk18::Gasol was always leading Memphis to the Western Conference Finals! Oh wait, no he wasn't.
Anthony Davis Brow ----v----::pau gasol was nothing with out kobe. bynum? please he wasn't even a factor most nights in those last 2 championships. yeah lebron was young, and he got swept and basically hasn't been closer since. not to mention the lakers would have never made it to ANY of those 3 shaq kobe finals with out kobe playing HUGE in the conference championships. and kobe is a shooting guard who has played his entire career with derek fisher as his best point guard.
Jthizz69::Kobe's rings he can thank Shaq, Pau, and Bynum for.  Kobe's never even been to a conference finals without an all-star/superstar 7-footer, and now he has 2.  Lebron led that garbage Cavs team to the finals while he was still pretty damn young.
SaintsNO9::God the timberwolves have really packed it in. Insert random bounty comment  here  ____________
reganomics86::there's always next year
iownamicrowave::unless you're a kings fan
45224_CollegeHill_Cincinnati::Let the doubters doubt.. Playoffs are around the corner, and people will see what Indiana is about.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::amen
coldsoresgalore::Pacers might get out of the 1st round but when they run into the Heat or Bulls they won't have a chance. NBA isn't about to allow a small market, no star player team go deep in the play offs. Heat and Bulls will have the refs on their side. Expect Rose, Wade, James to go to the free throw line whenever someone breathes on them.
IUPUIJags10::Also, you have to remember that in order for Rose to be fouled, that means that he actually has to play. It still amazes me that the Bulls win regularly without him. Shows what a deep bench they have. It was awesome last night seeing all 13 men on the roster get playing time. All contributed with at least a rebound too. Don't see that everyday.
newcaymanS::Miami really doesn't scare anyone because they have ZERO BENCH and ZERO HEART.  My money is on a Bulls v. Pacers Eastern Conference Final, with the Bulls winning in 6 or 7.  The Pacers are better than advertised and they have a deep bench.  They may be a year or two away or 1 mega star player, but they are solid from top to bottom which I can not say for Miami.  The Pacers have beaten OKC, Chicago, Miami and LA this year so they can play with ANYONE.
marcus-s2981::Those Pacer teams had players that were marketable then though.  I actually am not a pacers fan but they have some very nice players on that team...whoever they play in the playoffs theyre going to make them work bigtime.
tonyand1::That was exactly what everyone thought back in the 90's when the Pacers began a decade run to multiple ECFs and a Finals appearance in 2000.  This team will be around for years to come, of course good health and chemistry willing.  Don't discount how well this team matches up with all the East powers outside of Orlando because Howard and shooters give us fits.  West has been the glue and everybody sleeps on how Barbosa has transformed this team and added scoring punch ala JT in Dallas, which has taken pressure off Granger and freed up his own ever more versatile game.  The Pacers could fall in the 1st round, but they could also make the ECFs.  Its gonna be some fun time Indy however it turns out.
The Lakers are good at basketball::Sad but true
iownamicrowave::it is unfortunate that this thought is commonly accepted
The Lakers are good at basketball::Hahahahahahahahahaha Minny fans thought they were going to make the playoffs this year hahahahahahahahaha.   Seriously though I like the TWolves I hope they do well in the future.
nkruchten::Geek
nkruchten::You are a loser Laker fan!
mnohsix::maybe people will shut up about Rubio now and realize how important he was to the team.
The Lakers are good at basketball::I just wish he didn't have to be so SPANISH
Fili7052::indianna need all the help they can get they boutta get their butts woop n the playoffs
Fili7052::lmao
John-Kenneth96::LOLLLLLLLLLLLLL

The Lakers are good at basketball::Do you have a speech impediment? It sounds like you have a speech impediment.
Milwaukee Bucks.::Lol the Wolves are really bad.
ethanjconrad@gmail.com::Our two best players are out dude.
Semen Pond::Really hope you of cancer someday.
Malcyon1::You have to be one heartless little $@%!$ if you just told someone to get cancer...
CandySparker::Kevin Lotta Love!
BigHandsomeHoosier::If the Nets can hold off the Heat in the final 3 minutes, the Pacers will only be 3.5 games out of SECOND in the East.  I know that they won't catch the Heat, but WOW, what an improvement since JOB was canned.  Coach Vogel has done a great job managing games and not trying to do too much, and Larry has done an even better job assembling talent for him.  I can't wait until the playoffs!
BigHandsomeHoosier::Me too!  Especially since I have season tickets for the Hoosiers next year.  We're finally getting back to where the Hoosier state is playing really good basketball.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::i would love to go to iu next year. just to watch basketball haha i would be so happy
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::now that would make me happy. a deep pacers run into the postseason and then next year a deep run by the hoosiers, maybe ncaa championship. that would be a great year.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::now wouldnt it be amazing if the heat had a colossal collapse and the pacers keep up their streak? who woulda saw that coming
BigHandsomeHoosier::Nobody!  I just want to see the Pacers take out the Heat in the playoffs by playing TEAM basketball, something Hoosiers everywhere can appreciate.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::good game minny fans. good luck the rest of the year and next year! hope you guys can stay healthy. see the rest of you pacer fans next game
Semen Pond::Thanx for the kind words.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::anytime
eototal::Twins owning Yanks
PacerFan19a::This Wolves team when healthy will be very dangerous. K Love is a star in this league and Rubio is only going to improve with playing time. Add all their young talent and who knows what they can do.
IUPUIJags10::Not after the comments he made about that Pacers after their February 1 game...in Minnesota...with Rubio and Love...and the Pacers still won by 10 points. Collison took your boy Rubio out back to the wood shed and gave him a good old fashion whippin.
Btownguy0405::They were a much more interesting team early in the year, i just cant find myself liking K love though...
BigHandsomeHoosier::The Wolves would be right in the thick of things if Rubio, Love, and Ridenour were healthy.  I think they would be ahead of Utah and Phoenix and breathing right down the Nuggets neck for the 8 spot.  That's a good sign of things to come, and your fans have been real classy today.  Good luck next year, the Wolves will be on a short list of teams I want to see do well besides the Pacers.
Cory17532::How about that Win. Pacers an lakers in finals this year the rematch or the 2000 finals!
Cory17532::Of**
PacerFan19a::I would love a Wolves Pacers NBA finals next year though
pacerpride35::I'm glad we caught the Wolves when we did. They will be a playoff team next year, without question.
BigHandsomeHoosier::The Thunder are runaway favorites for the West next year.  I can't see any other team competing as their core goes into the prime of their career and the rest of the West ages.
BigHandsomeHoosier::The Wolves will be in the playoffs next year, but I think they need 2-3 more years to catch the Thunder.  This is the 2nd year the Pacers have shown signs of getting better, and they are still 2-4 against the top two teams in the East.  It takes A LOT of time to catch those top teams.  Sometimes even 3-4 years.
VikingsRavensMN::The T-Wolves are the youngest team out there.... And we can beat the Thunder, We took them to 2 OT without Rubio..
VikingsRavensMN::Next year don't think we're going to be this easy..
VikingsRavensMN::Nice to witness class on ESPN.
PacerFan19a::You would be a lot tougher this year if you were healthy. You guys have great talent.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i stopped watching, it wasn't fun to watch. no offense wolves fans. but pacers are hot right now and i like it. next year this wolves team will be a threat when healthy. good luck guys
md7152::thanks
assclap2::paul george and darren collinson after the game talking about the win http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF4QyjJNuXo&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL
Jthizz69::Derrick Williams has been pretty bad this year.  dude needs to stop chucking up threes and realize why he made it into the league.
md7152::Wolves clearly missed Ridnour in the lineup.  Ball just doesn't move the same without him out there.
K-LoveEatsBratWurst::Yay another nice job WOlves
PacerFan19a::Our main goal is to resign Hibbert and Hill this off season. We need to keep this core together.
K-LoveEatsBratWurst::Hibbert will go to Miami
BigHandsomeHoosier::I might jump off a cliff if that happens....just kiddin, but yeah I would be upset.
PacerFan19a::No chance in hell
philiptarrant::Definitely, which is why it's great that we have tons of cap, as they're getting paid next to nothing currently. Still should have some room left for a good FA, too, i think.
BigHandsomeHoosier::George Hill's putback was nasty for a little guy.
Cory17532::Best play of the game
SteaminBeamans::Add EJ to the Pacers...Legit contender! and yes EJ wants to come home
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::oh ok thanks hahah i thought eric gordon but i thought u would abbreviate it EG. but knowing he is a junior, EJ makes sense too
butinsho::edgerin james? but he is a running back.
SteaminBeamans::If you know Eric you know him as EJ
ND_COLTS_1::eric gordon
ColtsDGabb::who is EJ?
BigHandsomeHoosier::I don't like the move.  Keep Danny and PG as our 2/3 combo.  Not many teams can compete with that length.  EJ is too underzised in my opinion.
SteaminBeamans::Eric Gordon
Cory17532::Eric Gorden
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::who?
BigHandsomeHoosier::Eric Gordon, Jr.
assclap2::paul george and darren collinson after the win tonight http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF4QyjJNuXo&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL
phunky58::take a look at all the +/- of the minnesota starters.   adelman has the wrong people on the flooor it doesnt take a genius to figure it out.   startin lineup  barea ellington williams beasley pekovic
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::They're all we have left. At least he stopped starting Wes and Martell like he did ALL SEASON LONG.
BigHandsomeHoosier::It also had a lot to do with the Pacers resting their starters up by 30 in the second half.
PacerFan19a::I dont know why everyone seems to think we need to make a trade, we are a really good team now that is full of unselfish and dedicated players. Also, we are one of the youngest teams in the league and will do nothing but continue to improve. Why mess with what is not broken?
pacerpride35::Pacers are good enough to get by Miami or Chicago.
philiptarrant::Key need is a PF for when West is gone. Everyone else is young and should be re-signed, but going forward, we're going to need a big man alongside Roy, and while Psycho-T is a good boost off the bench, I cannot in any good faith call him our PF of the future.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::royce white is a beast. id thumbs up that pickup
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::they would of been sick if he did
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::He should have played for the Gophers...
BigHandsomeHoosier::I know haha...thanks for reminding me of his name
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::yea just wanted to name him for ya haha
BigHandsomeHoosier::That's who I was thinking of.
BigHandsomeHoosier::I agree.  I think the Pacers need to look for a SF / PF hybrid in this years draft.  The guy from Iowa State comes to mind.
Packers3821::They're good, but not good enough to get past Miami or Chicago
PacerFan19a::Not this year but just wait... we will be legit contenders in 2-3 years.
philiptarrant::Man, while I love us coming out and taking care of business, I kinda feel bad for the T-wolves. Hope they get healthy for next year.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::i 2nd this statement
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Wolves fans feel worse I think.
BigHandsomeHoosier::Great game by the Pacers.  The second half lull was pretty bad though.  PASS THE BALL BARBOSA
eototal::Pacers win the East please I dont want to see the Heat, Knicks or Celtics in the Finals.
matthollabak1::I would love to see Indy and OKC in the finals...good way  to $@%!  the east and west coast people off.
Packers3821::Chicago has a better chance than any of those teams to be honest, but If Milwaukee misses the playoffs I hope Indiana wins it too
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::I wouldn't mind Celtics too much. Heat I would hate.
PrinceOfDaSouf::Minnesota came in there tonight already planning to offer up them cheeks.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::New Orleans is probably the worst place on the planet. Hope it stays flooded next time.
PrinceOfDaSouf::Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo - So where you from then? hope it burns down.  You are displaying the characteristics of an internet sexual predator. Maybe you should try harder to hide it.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::So where you from then? hope it burns down.
PrinceOfDaSouf::I hope it does too
Semen Pond::I hate people from New Orleans.
PrinceOfDaSouf::so...
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::pacers fans, who would you like to see us pick in the nba draft, realisticly?
matthollabak1::Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if our pick is moved in a deal along with Tyler and maybe DC  for our PF of the future.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::gotcha. will be interesting to see if we make any big splashes. us indy fans could use an exciting offseason every now and then
matthollabak1::I don't know to be honest but with or without Bird next year we will be big players in FA and possibly shock everyone like we did getting George Hill that nobody even knew was available.   Hansbrough isnt our future at PF, and West looks like he may be more a 2 year rental than  a permanent fix, so we have to do something.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::who is our pf of the future? or who do we have a chance of getting? just curious
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Wolves should have figured out a trade for Monta Ellis this year. We need a SG soooo bad.
Packers3821::Ellis is overated, I'm a Bucks fan and at first i was excited to get him, but watching him shoot 2-12 every other game is incredibly frustrating.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::I think 2-12 is about as good as anyone we play at SG does.
eototal::i wanted the wolves to get Kevin Martin.
eazyt_971::Man Rick Adelman was top 10 all time in winning % among NBA coaches coming into the season. By the time his stint in Minnesota is done he will be nowhere near there anymore. Very sad. A hall of fame coach with Portland and Sacramento. He should have stayed on the west coast.
eototal::the Twolves are good when they have everybody healthy.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::we were decent anyway.
Packers3821::Rubio is a stud
Packers3821::I'm a Bucks fan, but if they don't make the playoffs, I'm hoping Indiana goes far. Its unlikely that they'll get past Miami or Chicago, but I'm hoping they do. I like this team.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::thanks we do too :)
matthollabak1::The Pacers have the trainer of the year and trainer assistant of the year from last year, and I doubt that will change after this season....you have to spend  on your medical  staff to compete, ask David West why he came to Indy over boston...training staff
PacerFan19a::One step closer to clinching the 3 seed.
Semen Pond::GL to the Pacers the rest of the way. Obviously, the Wolves have no future as they should be contracted.
GoMNSports924::wow... injuries can really kill a team
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::minny looked like a playoff team before all the injuries.
eototal::yeah
eototal::no wayz!
Copious_Fred::When will the Pacers get respect? We're in the top 5 or 6 for best teams for sure. But i bet most casual fans cant name our starting 5
mnsportswopbanthisespn::Real Heat fans don't show up to their games
cheesehead1287::Casual fans can't name any starting 5. Except for the Heat, of course.
matthollabak1::Casual fans cant name more than 3 heat players
mnsportswopbanthisespn::beat someone relevant in the playoffs don't just come close
