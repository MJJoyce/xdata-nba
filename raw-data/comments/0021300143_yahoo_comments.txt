brian::I heard a fat lady sung the national anthem.
poyman::Philly's top rebounder plays less than 14 minutes??? And he pulls down over 20% of the teams total rebounds for the game??? And 30 % of the teams total Offensive Rebounds??? Seems to me like he ought to be getting more minutes...  Hawes Plays over 10 minutes more and gets half the rebounds... That's wrong... Simply wrong.
Christopher::As a Sixers fan we need to lose, but one team we should add losses to are the Pelicans, whose Number 1 we have next year.  Where is the planning...
Greg::Anthony Davis is the new Tim Duncan.
emb001981::Ryan Anderson 1 of the most underrated players in the game. Very unique skill set. Dont see too many 6'10 guys that can shoot the three like him. Houston would kill to have that guy on the floor with Howard and Harden.
kodo::Finally, broberts got pelican playng time.  Quite a good new prospect they shouldn't shelve.
Kyle::Man, Anthony Davis is having a crazy start to the season
Chris Meittinis::cp3
Chris Meittinis::Marc Gasol over Spencer Hawes?
CLASH::look at what Austin Rivers did on 7-1/2 minutes...filled up the stat sheet!
