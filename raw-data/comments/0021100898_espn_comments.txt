l.--_--.l::Good game, Magic!
yorklinks2::it annoys me so much when ppl say lebrons not clutch and kobe is cuz well... thats wrong  kobe shoots .300fg% in the clutch, lebron has a .400fg%  if their stats in the clutch were throughout the whole game LEBRON is way better:  LeBron: 33.2ppg, 15.1rpg, 9.3apg, .386fg%  Kobe: 36.3ppg, 7.8rpg, 6.8apg, .327fg%  check out an article about that here, proof lebron is more clutch http://bustasports.com/?p=784
Mario Carroll::Can anybody tell me why Donald Sloan is playing twice the amount of minutes that Lester Hudson is?? This dude averages 5pts per game over his CAREER! I never even heard of Donald Sloan b4 I saw him as a starting guard for the CAVS!! That's why they are 19 games under 500!! Gotta know your personnel!!
Reality_And_Truth::The often injured and brittle Kyrie Irving out again.......the Cavs should trade him now, he is going to be a bust....can't guard a folding chair on defense.....
the702shogun::finally, an earl clark sighting.

MagicBoltzRays::Orlando is TRULY Tragic.
jyetter247::http://www.yetterisland.blogspot.com  Interesting stuff, pretty funny. 5 ways to improve baseball, why leBron is a loser, and more
L.A.beanbryant::random, but Earl Clark had a nice 13,3, &amp; 2 for a guy who doesnt get much love for playing time really...hes a nice player foreal
yorklinks1::buy the lephone, only vibrates no ring haha LECHOKE see pic of the phone here http://bustasports.com/?page_id=169
bradyandjrich::Orlando will be aight...Nelson, J-Rich, and Redick played great tonight and helped clinched a playoff spot. Hopefully Turk, Davis, and Howard are back before the playoffs start, but you gotta believe in these guys.
ChiefWahoo1995::Thankfully the season iis almost over.  Next year will be much better in Cleveland.  Check this out http://www.lakecounty-sentinel.com/index.php?p=51_48_LakeCounty-Sentinel.com-Cavaliers-dominated-by-Magic-100-84-04-15-2012
thenbatmm::jason terry misses game tying layup! unbelievable!!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUOE6XQmUsU
knicks_11::God-dang it cavs u guys aren't helping.
KingGeorge53::Believe in the ping pong ball.
Michael_Orlando_Magic4Life::One good thing about Davis getting injured is Daniel Orton finally getting some playing time.  He should get at least 10 minutes a game but never plays!  Let this guy develop.  He has a lot of potential.
bradyandjrich::That's true, he has talent and potential. But Davis was playing well before getting hurt. And losing Davis just weakens the depth further.
Michael_Orlando_Magic4Life::Like I said before Ryan Anderson is not near as good without Dwight Howard.  The double teams Howard attracts in the paint left Ryan Anderson open for those 3 pointers and jump shots.  He not good in the post and can't get open without Dwight Howard.  He is just a spot up shooter.  I knew this would happen too.
TheCronoMasterMind::He also is recovering from an injury. Hard to get your shots down if you're still hurting a bit.
Chris31708::There's a good chance he will transform into a ghost in the playoffs again, and it'll be worse this year since he's a starter and is supposed to be the 2nd/3rd option of the team.
UltimateStaredown::i mean this season is the worse with all the injuries stern really didn't have to fit 66 games into his $chedule its killing his product i mean damn ...they playoffs are going to be lopsided this year
Chris31708::Stern sucks, the Magic probably wouldn't have had all of these problems in a full season.
Michael_Orlando_Magic4Life::Derrick Rose, Kobe Bryant, Dwayne Wade, Amare Stoudemire, Zach Randolph to name a few who have been injured in this lock out season!
DTangMF::Good game Cav fans~ I hope we got everybody healthy by the playoff, and I hope we avoid the Celtic in the first round.
Chris31708::Another awesome game for Casper Anderson, 9 pts off of 3-11 shooting. Is this the same guy averaging 16 PPG this season?!?
TheCronoMasterMind::He hasn't been playing well since his injury. You try spraining your foot, and then go out and play as hard as he has a week later. Even sprains take a few weeks before they don't hurt. What he should do though, is stop hoisting the 3s until he's better. Off balance shots rarely work.
TheCronoMasterMind::I'm just saying, i sprained my foot a few years back, took a month to feel normal again. I can only imagine spraining it, and then playing basketball.
Chris31708::He got injured more than 2 weeks ago, I'll give him another week, if he's still pulling disappearing acts by next week then that'll confirm it.
TheTristanShow::I wish the Cavs could win a game by 16 without their star player and still have someone to blame.
Chris31708::Anderson is supposed to be the 2nd option of the team, he better start playing like one soon before he become more exposed than he is now.
Hands Off Hobo Joe::well, Lester the Molester seems to have dialed it back
Mario Carroll::It looks like they have cut Lester's minutes in favor of the great Donald Sloan (smdh)!! How the hell r u gonna beat anybody with Sloan playin' 35 minutes a game(lol)!!
KingGeorge53::I know.   :(
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::$@%! poor, the Cav's are playing with a D-League team, a 35 year old that's too old, and a unproved 4th overall rookie.
NUPE_NUPE_NUPE_NUPE::Holy shaky!!! Did Glen Davis get hurt?????????!!!!!
flexdafunk::We don't miss the Haters
spong3bobrox::So the Magic beat the CAVS and all of a sudden they're gonna win the FINALS! LMFAO
Chris31708::It was a joke, at least I hope it was.
spong3bobrox::check 4 comments below mine. ThomasLinder's
spong3bobrox::Welll. That was embarassing. No Howad or Hedo and we still get blown out.
TheCronoMasterMind::I am glad to see a win tonight, been a rough couple weeks for the Magic, but I'm hoping that's behind us, and I'm hoping Orton keeps playing like he did tonight(if SVG is smart enough to keep playing him). Also glad to see the Hawks lose by double digits at home, but that brings us one step closer to a Celtics team in the first round that's playing fantastic basketball. I think I'd prefer a pacers match-up!
thexdiamond::us pacer fans want a magic match-up as well.  best of luck!
TheCronoMasterMind::I wouldn't be surprised... lol
Chris31708::Watch SVG do the exact opposite of what you said, really it's gonna happen.
AllFloridaGuy::YES! GO MAGIC!
hee_haw_hee_hawn::ok
ThomasLinder::Magic Nba Champions!!!
DTangMF::U sure got a lot of faith...
killerkev369::Kings win. Cavs are now tied with their record, if I recall.
flexdafunk::Go Daniel Orton..!
theprodctz::Playoffs!????
DyersEve06::I don't know how but Sacramento manages to be worse than Cleveland.
mikeyp2307::kings could be a good team if their management didnt suck so bad. They have a ton of talent. Such a waste.
DyersEve06::Guess I spoke too soon.  They managed to pull out a win.  Thornton game-winner
mikeyp2307::if we had harangody the score would be reversed
Cashmon3y88::Lol
killerkev369::It's times like this that I miss JJ Hickson. Samardo Samuels reminds me a lot of him though.
torontoraps054::omfg that's sad. Now the raps are like 7-8 pick ... so sad
buhbuhballin::why are the cavs playing guys like anthony parker when they should be developing younger players in a blowout?
mikeyp2307::theres a good chance its parkers last season so might as well play em
torontoraps054::Raps got 3 d-leagures yet we still win . wtf is wrong with the hawks
TheCronoMasterMind::Wow, Hawks are being destroyed, I love it. Back to being tied with the Magic lol. Guess nobody wants to go against the Celtics in the first round.
Chris31708::The Magic actually used to play well against the Celtics from 2008-2010. Then the ECF happened and they turned into the Celtic's doormat, just like the Cavaliers did in the previous round. There really should've been a Cavaliers-Magic rematch that year, but the Cavs gave up in Game 5. If the Magic are weaker against the Celtics now blame it on Ryan Anderson, who turns into Casper when the pressure is on.
TheCronoMasterMind::Celtics have had the Magic's number for years, Hawks actually face up with them well. Close games all season against them.
Chris31708::I think the Magic are braver to face the Celtics than the Hawks are.
TheCronoMasterMind::They have been playing great down the stretch.
mikeyp2307::i think the celtics could make some noise come playoff time
killerkev369::^
mikeyp2307::the cavs have a full rotation of d-leaguers
DyersEve06::Since Dwight Howard.
mikeyp2307::the team that has the worst record hasnt won the lottery in a long time.
torontoraps054::lol. *drooling* over charlottes record at the moment
Drew0288::What happened to Glen Davis?
TheCronoMasterMind::Sprained leg in the first 7 minutes.
TheCronoMasterMind::You're telling me, I was worried when he went down. Then I find out that Orton is actually pretty good, and has just been sitting on the bench. Made me feel better lol
Drew0288::Dammit. He was doing so well for my fantasy team.
mikeyp2307::hurt
mikeyp2307::couldnt tell ya
Drew0288::How badly?
torontoraps054::C'mon cavs!
torontoraps054::cavs need to win this.
mikeyp2307::the raptors tank aint got shit on the cavs tank
TheCronoMasterMind::It's good to see the 3 ball falling for the magic again.
fearthevest10::Only comment I'll make on this game is that I know the Cavaliers aren't very good, but how can they be losing this bad to the Magic at home without Dwight Howard? I'm looking at that Magic team and I don't see a whole lot. Having said that, I don't really care because I think they've already won too many meaningless games the last two weeks. They need to lose out and let Sacramento pass them. Magic fans, sorry about what Howard is doing to you. Cavaliers fans know first hand. He will leave if you don't trade him first. He won't win you anything anyways. He's a loser like LeBron.
killerkev369::I feel for JJ Hickson and Mo Williams. They really wanted to stay with this team, but we traded them for the future of this team.
TheCronoMasterMind::Cleveland was the team to be reckoned with, its disgusting what Lebron did to that team. I respect the Cleveland team for coming out and playing with heart every night. Hell, I watched every game last year for the Cavs because even in that losing streak they had, they still came on to play every night.
Chris31708::Blame the Boston Celtics, the way they beat both of those teams in the playoffs 2 years ago was beginning of their struggles right now. Don't worry Cleveland/Orlando fans, Boston will go through the same thing very soon.
killerkev369::I hate to see it happen to another team. Back when we had Lebron, I was proud to say at least one Cleveland team was playoff bound.
TheCronoMasterMind::Howard may not play in the playoffs either, so it looks like the Magic will have to make due. I really hope he doesn't pull the same thing Lebron did, the Cavs are still trying to recover 2 years later...
thenbatmm::Jason terry misses game tying layup???? say what???  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUOE6XQmUsU
mikeyp2307::who cares
mikeyp2307::i cant wait till jamisons gone
killerkev369::I'm thinking the Cavs will use a second round pick on a PF. Who knows, we might find a gem.
mikeyp2307::agreed. TT is extremely raw offensively. I cant wait too see him next season with a legit nba offseason under his belt
DyersEve06::Need to have some veterans in the locker room though.  Cavs won't have many after this season.
killerkev369::Once he leaves, Tristan will have to fill his place. Tristan honestly doesn't seem ready to be a starter yet. He has his good games, and his REALLY, REALLY bad games.
crandall678::The Magic are much better without Howard.
Chris31708::No they aren't better, take Howard off the team and they wouldn't have been a playoff team with a winning record the last 4 years.
TheCronoMasterMind::Yeah, the horrible play style and losing streak shows. They're winning because they're going against a struggling Cavs team. All of their big wins this season were WITH Howard...
TheCronoMasterMind::I'm liking Orton's play style right now. If Davis is injured, it doesn't seem as worrisome to see Orton start the next game. Looking at the news, Howard may not even be with the Magic for the playoffs(SVG is preparing for it without him, nobody knows he'll be healthy).
killerkev369::Detroit, Charlotte, Toronto, and New Orleans are all keeping up in their games. I'm actually praying that we finish worse than at least the Hornets, Raptors, and Pistons.
Xtone2::good lose another Cavs. and Y? well Sac figured it out. Play the person that fills stats in I. thomas over Jimmer. Cavs are playing Sloan way too much and fuc%$ing Manny Harris has more minutes then Lester Hudson. Hudson has put up better stats accross the board when given the minutes. Cavs are stupid. Can't even lose goood enough to have the worst record for a really great pick.
mikeyp2307::slow ur roll big boy
DyersEve06::No way the Cavs could play worse than Was, Sac or Charlotte.  Top 4 is our "ceiling"
GOGETTA10MIL::ORTONNNNNNNNNNNN
