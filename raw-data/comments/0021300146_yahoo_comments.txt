Darth Apollyon::I have to say that Redick was a great acquisition by the Clippers and that was all on Rivers.  He is a very good and consistent offensive weapon that is not considered a star.
Homey's Gay brother Paul::Has anyone seen Victoria Wong.  She's got that crush on Jeremy Lin.  I wonder if the two of them hooked up.
Rodney::OK - lets start with that avatar.  The real homey has the top of the clown head chopped off.
I State Facts And You Get Mad::Typical NBA teams, the other team rests there starters and the other team just doesnt get up for the game... This should be a blow out in the second half
Larry The Fairy::Gilligan lets do it.
Rodney::My ClipJoint will lose for sure tonight.
Hollywood::Matt Barnes is a ghetto loser like the fans.
Cyril::You have to love watching the Nets play one of their best games with 4 of their 5 highest paid players sitting on the bench. They're going to have to find a way to mix up the rotations so they aren't all on the court at the same time.  Maybe Garnett and Pierce should come off the bench.
Fugly::Please don't make me shoot farther than 5ft away from the basket please nooooo.
Homey D Clown::Clipper fans are going to be disappointed again like last year when they took it in the rear in the playoffs.
