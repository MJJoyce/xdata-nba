dbaerry::kemba just knows how to find ways to win. i have non idea why he didn't start earlier
BearJWS::Kemba Walker willing his team to a win again.  Almost like UConn. Too bad he didn't have more talent around him.  Charlotte's 2 best players are PGs.
tama drummer 7728::I wonder how comfy that broadcast booth is looking to Mark Jackson right about now?  Ellis is a worse gunner than Derrick Rose ...
CandySparker::Charlotte Walker!
NCR8derSkinfan::finally!!!!!!! Diaw is on the bench and Kemba is starting
ny2nc1980::Well, a wins a win. Charlotte needs anything at this point.
supe540::Glad I missed this game.  The Warriors stink.
Teutonic Fury::Wait.... BJ Mullens is playing basketball?  What the F?
sinatrascue::samaki walker?
BearJWS::Clueless Alert....
sinatrascue::antoine walker?
BrettStormNYRanger1972::Come on Rockets !     Jean, another 2 winners from Sports Betting Solution ! I parleyed 76ers -8, Rockets +2 and Lakers +3. If Lakers +3 hit, I could win $700 today.     NBA Basketball Basketball - Sat 1/14    Philadelphia 76ers -8 +103 @ Washington Wizards - Double Dime Pick (Hawes needs to play)    Houston Rockets +2 -105 vs Portland Trail Blazers - Single Dime Pick
sportspotpourri::Walker should not give back this spot for the rest of the year.
Ravens go Hard::GS really needs a big man.....hell if Howard doesnt go to the NJ the Nets might have to trade D-will.  If they trade D-will GS needs to trade curry for lopez.....
Talentsojhin::Good game GS. Good luck the rest of the way.
NCR8derSkinfan::They lost
AY410::lets go kemba
Jeff7429::weeeee.....a moral victory for the sucko losers
s.molla1993::Warriors is is ridiculous, the Bobcats are S***.
Jeff7429::don't HAVE to shoot 3s idiot....
Allen4875::38 point quarter looms big now.   teams that throw the knockout punch early generally win.
Allen4875::exactly.
Jeff7429::lesson is...come ready to play.
bosie32::damnn right
Ravens go Hard::the other lesson is shoot better.....Ellis cant go 6-26 and expect to win
Jeff7429::Kemba&gt;Ellis,  again.
bosie32::$@%! no, ellis just had a bad game
Jeff7429::now Monte is miss FT when they need it...lmao,
John996202::Monta is killing my fantasy team with his crappy fg% tonight. He needs to come in and hit a couple of quick threes to redeem himself..
bosie32::hahaha ellis just had a bad game, but they all do
Allen4875::GS not coming back.
Ravens go Hard::and here we goooo........lets go warriors
robtyel::come on Gs!!!
Talentsojhin::Finally we get to the line jesus.
Talentsojhin::3 points in the fourth quarter.....how inspiring.
MasterWangkee::Stick with the small lineup Silas:  Walker - Augustin - Henderson - Thomas - Mullens.  Let has-beens like Diaw and Maggette (when he returns) ride pine.
Bankai_2069::KEMBAAAAAAAA
dreamhax::bobcats cant get any luckier.
sarahsmemarie::check out  shortsportshorts.com ... its a new sports blog..looks pretty cool
sarahsmemarie::check out  shortsportshorts.com ... its a new sports blog..looks pretty cool
dreamhax::We need a new coach. This is bs. Losing this bad to the bobcats? Wow.
bosie32::curry is good , but the problem with the GS is that they have no defense. they only have a good offense
Jeff7429::GS has ONE player another team would want...maybe 2.  Lee and Ellis.   Not just a coaching problem.
123212go::what about curry?
Norris Cole ROY::Wasn't Charlotte the worst offensive team in the league last year? Damn
Norris Cole ROY::Golden State really needs Curry to come back....
medoeapoa::Timberwolves has 4 white people in the starting team. plus the coach  wow. they will become my favourite team.
sarahsmemarie::check out  shortsportshorts.com ... its a new sports blog..looks pretty cool
Ravens go Hard::Monta is a beast but damn......he killed GS tonight
bosie32::he did blow the game tonight, i expected atleast a 40 point game, he just had a bad night
Jeff7429::wow....GS makes up ZERO points after 6 minutes, impressive.
Jeff7429::I like Henderson and Augustine. ..provides 2 terrific shooters
Jeff7429::not sure if Charlotte could score this well facing no defenders.....seriously.
Jeff7429::and Lee will foul out pretty soon....then commence the ugliness.
Jeff7429::GS can't defend so they'll never get back into this game.
Jeff7429::basically just trading baskets now like I thought
medoeapoa::Rubio also knew as "the worst shooter" in Spain, is doing pretty well.
Talentsojhin::European players usually are good shooters.
Allen4875::I wonder if the players feel embarresed or if they just say check is in the bank and mail this $@%! in.
Jeff7429::for Ellis....the 2nd. one
Jeff7429::Ellis is crap...
Jeff7429::and is charlotte's best player
supreme91::49ners advancee
Jeff7429::I wonder if SF just uses Oakland as a land fill for their garbage.
robtyel::GS should cover -6      2nd half
Jeff7429::what's 2nd half line ?
