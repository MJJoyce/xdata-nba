loyalsockbasketball::idc John wall cooked that game
Knight_Rider_2000::The Grizz belong in Memphis  The City of Grit &amp; Grind
Jack Kelso.::Good win refs. 37 free throws?  Those whistles were on fire.
emthomasjr::Ugly win but I'll take it!
yorkalldayy::the real big 3? scalibrine luke walton and kwame brown http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/p/best-nba-memes.html
Mountainrockis67::I've been following a betting system called sportsbettingstar for a few months now. I have made over 3K a month for two consecutive months since I started playing this system. If you google "sports betting system" you will find the system on the first page of Google. It is the best system I have tried in many years of betting
nu life::Will Gilbert Arenas help the grizz down  the stretch? Or will he be a distraction in the locker-room.
emthomasjr::All we need is for Gilbert to be less horrid than Pargo and Selby, our current back up PG's.  Pargo seemed to play decent tonight, but the offense still tends to get extremely constipated with Conley out.  Arenas can't hurt the Grizzlies at all.
Quickdeath2::both
royboy1978::Aight fellow Grizz fans, be safe.
rc021363::Nite
nu life::Lewis Hamilton P3 in Australia, and the grizz grind another one out.  Not a bad day for me dog.
rc021363::Congrats!
rc021363::Hollins, in post game told Z-Bo that he is starting next game!
utclindsay::That is a good sign! Hope the chemistry of this team comes together by the playoffs.
nu life::Thank goodness for that win.  We got just a little breathing room on the mavs.  And these next series of games will be brutal.  That's why that win was what they needed to break the ice with z-bo back.  Let the chemistry begin.
royboy1978::It's good to actually focus on the NBA now that college hoops is over with for me.  I don't feel like I'm having a heart attack watching the Grizzlies like I do when I watch the Tigers play.
emthomasjr::The one and done of the NCAA tourney is a roller coaster.
MaxPowerOptic::Wanna have the same feeling? put a bet or three on ..u will get that feeling again
MaxPowerOptic::LOL...you are ok in my book Roy
royboy1978::Nope because I don't bet.
rc021363::You got that right!  My night was not fun after seeing both the Tigers and Grizzlies lose back to back.
rc021363::Rudy seems like he is fully recovered from the concussion.
grapenutz78::5= John Walls Bball IQ  How do u just throw the ball off the backboard like that??
rc021363::Good game, Wiz, good luck with rest of the season.
royboy1978::The ONLY thing that matters is that the Grizzlies got the W on their ledger.  F Betting!!!!! F Spreads!!!!! F Lines!!!!!!  Just GRIT N MOTHERFU(KING GRIND!!!!!!!!
dirtycash66::good one
MaxPowerOptic::You are right, from now on i will bet the Gritz to win out right only.
rc021363::Great game Wizards, close at the end.
sr271982::What kind of meaningless fukinnn dunk was that?
rc021363::I believe we can call it a Grizzlies win! Yes, after the last several days of disappointments in these games, I feel good about the Griz right now.
Mountainrockis67::I've been following a betting system called sportsbettingstar for a few months now. I have made over 3K a month for two consecutive months since I started playing this system. If you google "sports betting system" you will find the system on the first page of Google. It is the best system I have tried in many years of betting
MaxPowerOptic::Of course you did make 3k a month if the people go there and signed up to the system.
royboy1978::WHO GIVES A SH.I.T???????
Spitta19::what was todays line?
Spitta19::nvm.. i can look myself. I am a Memphian myself bros. just didnt bet any today so I didnt look at the lines
Spitta19::lol i konw that but how many pts were we giving?
royboy1978::Who cares????
royboy1978::Grizzlies winning is today's line!!!!!!!
scrapnice::Exactly....that's all we care about on this board.
rc021363::See, in the Raptors' game, the Grizz could not even buy a free throw shot.  At least they are making it tonight.
beavcoon24::can i ram my ongo bongo into ur red velvite under grounds
beavcoon24::$@%!
beavcoon24::$@%!$
beavcoon24::J LIN LINSAINTY LINTENDO 64 TO LIN FINITY AND BEOND ALL I DO IS LIN LIN LIN NO MATTER WHAT
rc021363::OK, who do you all think will make Grizz's last shot if they make one?
emthomasjr::F*****g Rudy Gay, man!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg
Benjamayne::RUDY
rc021363::I am guessing OJ
dirtycash66::precum&gt;grizzlies &amp; royboy
scrapnice::It seems that he doesn't have the key to the closet.
royboy1978::You really have a fetish for me do you kid?  You keep bringing up eating c.o.ck and sper.m and all other se.xu.al innuendos.  Sorry dude, but I don't swing that way.
royboy1978::Now we gotta make FT's down the stretch.
cycycychris::No need to worry. Wizards never make cluth shots.
Benjamayne::ATTA BOY RUDY
Mavsolute_Beast_41::cool
cycycychris::UGH!!!!! That sucks:(
royboy1978::DAGGER!!!!!!!!
scrapnice::Gametime.....for an ugly game.
rc021363::Rudy was hot in the last game, too bad he fouled out early in OT, or I think the Grizz would have won.
kebojr::if they hadn't missed 20 ft they would've won
royboy1978::Man, you gambling trolls are a trip.  You waste your entire paycheck betting on sports.  I sure do hope that you are taking care of your responsibilities before you blow away your monthly earnings.
scrapnice::Roy, u still p!$$ing off the trolls.....lol
royboy1978::Trolls are like roaches.
dirtycash66::eat a dic.k royboy
royboy1978::Not hungry like you are kid.
gerpurman::that's not your business biitch
rc021363::He deserves some respect, and right to his opinion.   So, slow down on your name calling.
royboy1978::When you post your business on the internet (i.e. betting on sports), you make it everyone's business kid.
dirtycash66::i'm out of here....fuc.k this game
royboy1978::FUC.K YOU TOO TROLL!!!!!!
Lebron is in the illuminati::<b>Rudy Gay is the most underrated player in the entire league. <b></b></b>
rc021363::Rudy did the clutch job in the Raptor game, didn't he?:)
rc021363::They aren't playing with that spark lately, not sure why.
rc021363::Maybe..... One possiblity is inserting Z-Bo in the starting role is tough right now, everyone is re-adjusting.
royboy1978::Z-Bo didn't get the start tonight.
royboy1978::Chemistry issues?
cycycychris::Why can't the Wizards ever finish the game in the 4th. All they can do is turn the ball over.
rc021363::Grizzlies aren't doing as well as they usually have lately.
ZamiSalami::its like theyre trying to blow the spread
ZamiSalami::n im sure ur mom does how else could i pay for her services
ZamiSalami::i do
MaxPowerOptic::LOL...take Wiz with the spread u wouldn't be saying that
royboy1978::Who cares about a spread?
rc021363::dirtycash, was that really called for?
dirtycash66::your mom
ZamiSalami::they just had so many oppurtunities to pull away n theyre missing easy shots wtf
rc021363::See, Z-Bo with only 19 mins is one problem to me.
royboy1978::He has to build back up his full strength.
rc021363::Ah, gotya.  Sounds like the game that went into OT, they should have won that one against Raptors.
Logan8772::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhRtC0QJ9WU soo sick!!
royboy1978::The refs aint helping either.
rc021363::Sorry, forgot about the game.  How have the Grizz played today?
yosellindreams::He means to say normal just like always
royboy1978::Up and down like a roller coaster.
rc021363::Yes!  Keep the momentum going!
royboy1978::Hey fellas.  Hoping that y'all show up at some point.
yosellindreams::I would be here
lugeneparker::Were here.  Most of us just read comments.  Dont respond to trolls or the gamblers!  Makes for some interesting entertainment!
MaxPowerOptic::Seriously...it's pretty sad when there are more gamblers here than actual fans of the teams playing
MaxPowerOptic::If we weren't here you will be talking/commenting to yourself.
rc021363::Go Grizzlies!
bballboi33::Sometimes the Grizzlies look so unfocused. especially against bad teams
Ruby6381::suddenly this game went over for no reason.... WIZARD is VEGAS prey team....
dirtycash66::WOW  THERES STILL HOPE FOR -12.5
Ruby6381::you can tell by the way the play... thru out the games... they always pull close or at the end they trying to get a dunk to cover the spread....  look at the Laker game vs Wolf so rigged
sr271982::they cost me against the hawks...those assholessssss
Ruby6381::WIZARD is the team from VEGAS to hit heavy bettors on FAVOR teams... look at some games where line at -11 to -15... WASHINGTON always pull close to make sure they cover the spread.
MaxPowerOptic::Why, 9 to go up by 5 plenty of time to cover
Ruby6381::guess not fk
dirtycash66::NOT
sr271982::let me tell you a real f'd up game that kngs and timbers going on...you would of lost every single under bet..
Ruby6381::i lost under on ATL today... 6 pts in the final 39s wtf is that... Jerry stackhouse seriously score 4 then a dunk from Cleveland... nonsense
sr271982::Lol espically with their public perception hype with the dunks and all.........always an inflated line
MaxPowerOptic::Clips is the best to place under bet atm
Lebronwadebosh6334::I think Memphis is finally gon pull away now! Idk about them covering their 12.5 spread but Memphis will win this game!
sr271982::your original bet is wrapped up in missed fts
sr271982::wtf are you talking???.....wiz up by three grizz minus 9...that means your getting a 6 and a half point discount...to me a push is still a win...lol
sr271982::but wiz will probaly beat grizz....gee wiz like to butttfukk grizz
sr271982::Listein you gambling fools...always wait for the half....you could of bet grizz and only had to win by 6
pugilistfan::what if they were up at half they would have to win by like 16
dirtycash66::TRUE
