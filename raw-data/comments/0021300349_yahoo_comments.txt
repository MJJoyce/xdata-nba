louie molina::Go spurs go... I want some nasty... We got this one spurs win!!!
couldbealaw::I'm hoping Tim Duncan can get another ring before he retires!!
Richard::Timmy being Timmy.
Anton::Why even play games like this? This is a joke. Spurs are the best team and the Jazz are a joke, for the last 10 years.
amos::play your starters
rank::pop is drunk. big played! :)
Alex::lets go MANUUUU!
Devin H::the spurs wanted to sign Andrei Kirilenko and Kyle Korver...  am disappointed AK didnt sign, as he would have been fun to watch, as Popovich would make him create very difficult matchups, and play some help defense and point forward..  Korver....well...if Bellini can average almost 10, korver would get 15 per game.
Voon::jazz win
Chad G::start green or manu? will they rest manu?
