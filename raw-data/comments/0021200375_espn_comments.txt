mosesbyu::Free Jimmer.
Foshiz Honkizel::WTF - 258 points w/o OT. No D.
dog_has_fleas::Megan Beeson
cb5x::If we played the Warriors every game we'd be a playoff team.
sweetlew09::the dubs lost 2 games to the magic and 2 games to the kings.... they just cannot beat crappy teams
dsphillips100::in both games it was the 3pt shooting that killed them. Neither team (Magic/Kings) are great 3pt shooting team but the made a bunch against the Warriors.
fjpowlan::Refs lost this game for the dubs. Curry's last 2 "fouls" were bs. If you swipe the ball up and it hits the player in the face that's not a foul.
TheRydog3::The Warriors lost the game. Not the refs
TheRydog3::That wasn't the only factor. You can't ever pin the blame on the refs. The Warriors should not have left the outcome in the refs hands.
dsphillips100::it was pretty clear. Its not so much that fouls called on the Warriors weren't fouls. It was that they weren't fouls on the other end.
TheRydog3::Also if you're talking to me its spelled, "Mormon"
TheRydog3::Who you talking to bro? Because smarter has 2 R's in it, and "we're" is different than "were"
jblickman::So original...  glad u enlightened us with your superior knowledge were so much smarter now for that...  MORON!
TheRydog3::Excuses are like @ss.holes. They stink and everyone has one.
jblickman::Uhh check out the foul desparity Kings had double the foul called and the Dubs play better D than the Kings... The Refs controlled the tempo of the game every time the Dubs made a run.  Cousins does not get the calls any other night... He all of sudden was D. Howard for the night.  LOL that was a joke of a game that the refs cashed in there 5k each for the fix.
Jagundes88::i'm sure the refs our out to get the warriors and would rather see then kings win? get over it the kings out played the warriors the refs have nothing to do with it
Jagundes88::yeah and when curry  got those three freethrows that wasn't a foul either... it goes both ways
j2the4thpow3r::I know the Dubs got to lose a game every once in a while...But why lose to the Kings? Can't we lose to someone thats actually good?
78Bevan::Jimmer won this game with his FT shooting.  Smart was coaching to win tonight.  Maloofs made a lot of money on this game tonight.  (not from ticket sales, but in Vegas)
ireadespn::Warriors played fine, Kings just shot lights out. 57% from 3? Madness.
S184::Warriors stink go bulls
ricky2213::Is Thomas Robinson that bad? I like to check the rookies out and i notice he doesnt get many minutes.
gocaliforniabears::warriors are a fluke, won't make playoffs
Cameron46500::Good win Kings. Way to send those Bay Area patsies back home with a loss. Warriors flat out couldn't hang tonight.
jblickman::Too bad your team suck big D with a $@%!$@ %!$ NOTSO Smart coach  headin no where fast and Maloofs bein cheap cuz they want out of Sacto.  I'll take the over rated loss aided by refs and our chance to be in the playoffs.  Wheres the Queens gonna be now and in the future. BOTTOM DWELLERS!  ENjoy your crappy team cuz they really suck!
KingsWillWinSomeday::I wish the Kings could play like this every game.  Good win guys
Cameron46500::I wish the Kings could play the warriors every game.
dsphillips100::Refs stole this game early. And the King 3 point shooting ended it. Best game ever for the kings. Doubt they make 11-18 3's in a game ever again.
calvintheidiot::really? fredette not even in for free throws? ok keieth dumb.
jblickman::in Dubland we called him "NOTSO" Smart  because he's not a real BB coach.

gatorfan15151::well david lee you tried buddy congrats on the 10 strait 20 or more point games!
BYUsGotHeart::Quick question: How many FTs did Jimmer make to end the game, and how many points did the Kings win by?   Thanks in advance..   ;)
EarlDean60::About time that waste did something, it's only been two years... now if he can keep it up maybe we'll keep him and that used car lot in Provo will have to hire someone else.
Jagundes88::nope just tax the middle class to save the rich more money instead
TheRydog3::No Earl doesn't have a job, he didn't vote for Romney because Romney promised to create jobs and not tax the middle class to feed the poor.
ADK046::Worried about your job being taken?
twhittle74::That is the first time in awhile  he has been that far in the negative.  He leads the team in PER.
toshsghost::Not sure how many free throws he knocked down to end the game, but his +/- was -14.
toshsghost::Oops.
joshsy77::that's a reflection of everybody on the floor at the time - he put up 15 points in 15 minutes, pretty impressive.  Last game it was 22 points in 22 minutes.
