Mikey::This team needs to run and gun... Brian Shaw trying to slow the pace and play more defense.  This isn't Indiana... Use the Altitude to your advantage smh...
Sir Slam::Running Mozgov/McGee in an extremely deep league is turning out to be the worst handcuff of all time.  What the hell Shaw?  Going small with Faried as your Center I can almost accept, but running Lawson, Robinson, Miller and Foye simultaneously is insane.  I have no idea how they're pulling it off.
jtansanco::I wonder what George Karl is thinking after first few games of the Nuggets..
Louis Carlo O::this year the MANIMAL is playing HUMAN... damn i need his stats...
Ryan::the manimal should be playing 30 plus mins not this 20 22 #$%$ he is way better then jj hickson
Cyril::What happened to the guys saying Jeff Teague was purposefully going to play poorly this year to get back at the Hawks for matching his offer from the Bucks?  Five games in he has been the 2nd best point guard in the East.
Commenter::Better be chucking 3s and getting steals all day with 4 pgs in
Anton::Denver are definitely tanking for Wiggins...they are playing like chicken nuggets LOL
PX::still don't understand what in the world Hawks are doing with 3 PFs on this team with the same skillset. They need a C badly but sign Brand and Millsap to play the same role as Horford? smh.
Commenter::Brian shaw is as good coach as he was a player
