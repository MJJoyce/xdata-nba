MavsHater4ever::cheer up mavs fans. Things could be worse, you could be Laker fans!!!
tw8432::typical Lala fans...everytime they're on the losing end, they point to the past. I don't think Kareem and Magic can help you idiots  in the 2012-13 season
SteeleKen::you'd love to be a Laker fan...a team that is in disarray and yet, only 1/2 game behind you're lottery bound Mav's....too funny....  16 Banners....31 Finals....and Dallas????
ac132f::Knicks are doing their best of trying to clone the mavs 2011 championship team this year
47riley47::No one that plays like dirk (Melo is just not there), jj or matrix.
wilmaso::? kidd, chandler plus an top 10 player offensively, surrounded by 3 point shooters...yeah kind of like the mavs.
ac132f::Dirk will be back by Christmas
dirkaqs41::i would love to see the mavs pull a trade for larry sanders...give em kaman and we can take a couple of their terrible contracts they need cap room bigtime if they want to keep jennings after this yr
---LeTs gO mAvS---::Mavs could pick up Jennings this free agency since they have so much cap but I think they should for now go after a pg such as Tyreke Evans
dirkaqs41::also they have 3 centers and no big men that can score the ball
jonnyOKCThunder::Anyone know when Dirk will stay playing again?
jonnyOKCThunder::Man, that's tough.  Dirk is a good dude and makes the games more entertaining.  I hope he recovers quickly.  Dallas would certainly benefit from his return.
Justinkm83::He didn't look comfortable during the rehab session that they showed during the game
Orange-Blooded::1-2 months maybe
jonnyOKCThunder::It remains a mystery, I guess.
jonnyOKCThunder::Start playing
bluedevils1148::Difference between last year's and this year's Sixers: effort.
Justinkm83::Difference between last year's Sixers and this year's Sixer's : Iguodala
CoreyGallagherArt::Holiday, Turner, and Thad are all playing great due to Iguodala's departure, if you would have said a combination of injuries, Iguodala to an extent, Lou Will off the bench, or Brand whom was a competent big than sure.
Flash Barrett::Brandon18502 Why would anyone want Kidd? 4 points a game? 5 assists? _______________________________________  U only look at stats to determine whether u want a player?
Orange-Blooded::The best way to decide if you want a player is to look at their rating in NBA 2K
Justinkm83::Good thing we won that one, but there's a good chance we lose 6 in a row.
Justinkm83::He doesn't turn it over because he doesn't play. I don't need to check his stats. I know what I see. His best and most consistent shot is the runner in the lane.
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::He doesnt play dude ,why trade him ? he cant hurt the team on the bench can he ?
Justinkm83::I didn't say trade him. I said no one wants him now. We will end up cutting him.
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::Ankle Brace ..I over exaggerated ...sue me ....point is he cant run or cut like we're used to seeing from him......big difference....And which Roddy are we talking about ? Turnover prone???? R U sure ?check his stats sir..He doesnt turn it over and he only shoots 3's because he doesnt drivr the lane (ankle brace).....No big deal....stalemate
Justinkm83::Exactly. That's what I've been saying. He's useless. We should have traded him when he was in demand. Nobody wants him now.
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::He played 2 mins tonight ........Roddy is far better than Collison but Coach wont allow him to make any mistakes but the worse thing is he wont correct them either ......It's like he wants to make this kid a bust .
Justinkm83::What does Roddy do when he's on the court? The only shots he makes anymore are the runnners in the lane. He can't shoot from the outside. He's TO prone, and doesn't have the leaping ability anymore.
Justinkm83::No one plays in a cast. C'mon man you can't be serious.
kyler55ek::he played tonight. what cast
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::You and your lady do see the cast on his left foot right?
Justinkm83::It's an ankle brace. Not a cast.
kyler55ek::hes not good because he doesnt play. same as tebow, he doesn't play because he is not good!
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::You havent seen Roddy play enough to determine he 's not good .
Justinkm83::I've seen Roddy play for 3 years (when his ankle isn't in pieces). He's an undersized SG that can't shoot. He lacks confidence, and doesn't have that burst anymore. He's on the bench for a reason. He does nothing when he comes in.  My Gf calls him ol' brittle bones.
Orange-Blooded::Your not a fan if your talking like that.
Justinkm83::I'm a die hard fan. I never miss a game. I also know the game of basketball. The next opponents are all better than us. You know it. Some fans don't like to hear it. Hopefully we pull a few out.
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::Not if Roddy and Dirk return to the lineup
Justinkm83::Roddy? ha ha. He's not hurt (right now). He's just not good.
FanofTexas28::Mavs, just don't get embarassed by Miami. At least put up a fight. That Christmas game last year was really hard to watch.
Flash Barrett::I think Mavs should try and keep Wright for the future to go with Mayo.. good defensively ok rebounder and can score a lil bit... send him to Hakeems camp and he'll be straight.... hr needs to get more minutes more consistently.. it seems like he'll play 30 minutes one game then 15 the next...that will not help him
FanofTexas28::I like Wright. Another guy that for whatever reason, gets inconsistent playing time.
Justinkm83::Me too. I would much rather Brand be on the bench.
---LeTs gO mAvS---::Mavs vs Heat next  Glad the game is in Dallas
FanofTexas28::The last time they were in town in December didn't go so well...
no look high five::Bynum was clutch tonight.
FanofTexas28::I don't get why Do Jo plays all the time, but Roddy never gets to play.
Whutitdew3::i agree with justin. no confidence and just doesn't have that energy like he used to
Justinkm83::I think every time I see someone comment about Roddy that they're being sarcastic. There's no way you people think he can contribute. He's an undersized SG that can't shoot. He lacks confidence, and doesn't have that burst anymore. He's on the bench for a reason. He does nothing when he comes in. My Gf calls him ol' brittle bones.
Whutitdew3::brandon jennings for sure. did you guys see what deron williams said earlier? glad cuban didn't go to the meeting for that guy. even though i wanted him earlier it opened up my eyes about him. he is pretty overrated for almost 20mil a season
FanofTexas28::I would be all right with that.
FanofTexas28::Roddy is better than both, IMO. But, none of them are a long-term solution. We needed D-Will.
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::I agree 1,000% ....roddy is better than both but Carlisle hates him
Orange-Blooded::Maybe Brandon Jennings in the offseason?
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::Dojo played better than Collison
Orange-Blooded::That is embarrassing for Collison.
Abner7716::I told you so...less TO high chance of winning. Good job MAVS!
---LeTs gO mAvS---::Mayo is a Beast. Mavs have found their future young Shooting Guard. All we need now is a point guard. Go Mavs!!!
Orange-Blooded::I love the Juice!
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::Roddy B &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Collison + Dojo
kyler55ek::roddy sucks bro
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::Your sick ,Roddy B&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dojo .......dont get fooled by a couple games
---LeTs gO mAvS---::Dojo &gt; Roddy B &gt;  No matter what Mavs are going after a new pg after this season
bluedevils1148::Why doesn't he play?
---LeTs gO mAvS---::he sucks
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::Coach hates him
FanofTexas28::Beat the Heat!!!
Whutitdew3::BEAT THE HEAT! BEAT THE HEAT!
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::second that
Whutitdew3::Good game sixer fans!
bluedevils1148::You too
bballdon32::Need Jrue back, badly..
raytowson::please make both mayo -6.5!!!!!!!
Gamble817::Mayo saved us
Orange-Blooded::Lol, O.J. Mayo is a better PG than Collison.
Brandon18502::Why would anyone want Kidd? 4 points a game? 5 assists?
spacebump::because we have to start Fisher.
Whutitdew3::crowder, james, cunningham
Gamble817::Zeller but traded him to cavs
bluedevils1148::Oh wait Crowder never mind.
FanofTexas28::We wish would've just kept Kidd.
bluedevils1148::Who did you guys draft?
---LeTs gO mAvS---::agreed
PATSORGENOS2012::On to Houston
potato623::Can't wait...Harden is going to rape us
ganggreengaingreen_oww::sixers are really missing that big bum bynum out there... and with holiday out forget about it. im not gonna write the sixers out yet.. but its a very sluggish couple weeks here
---LeTs gO mAvS---::Mavs need to make a trade for a pg. Darren Collison is not good
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::Give Roddy a shot to play with Wright and Mayo and Kaman and watch him shine
Bill34851::don't care that the sixers are losing, wright is shooting lights out
bluedevils1148::Why is that more important than a win?
AdamFinesse::Tyreke
bluedevils1148::No idea why Sixers got rid of Lou for Nick Young...
ganggreengaingreen_oww::youre giving lou will too much credit... he shouldnt even be on the court when the games on the line, neither should young for that matter
ganggreengaingreen_oww::yeah hes definitely a better 1 than young, but holiday will be back tomorrow
bluedevils1148::In this situation without Holiday, he would certainly help.
AdamFinesse::Lou is a much better leader on the court. I'd take him him over Young any day.
PATSORGENOS2012::Not debating Lou is the better player, but not worth a starter's salary
PATSORGENOS2012::Because Lou isnt worth 7 mil a season
bluedevils1148::Right about now he seems like he is, based on how expensive NBA players are nowadays.
ganggreengaingreen_oww::Theyre the same person
bluedevils1148::No, Lou's a better passer and is slightly smarter with shot selection.
PATSORGENOS2012::Wright is on nba jam type fire
bluedevils1148::Too late though...less he wants to be Reggie Miller at the end here.
Whutitdew3::only 11 turnovers tonight gotta play like this dallas!
raytowson::unbelievable
FanofTexas28::Collison has been a dissapointment. I thought he'd be better.
Whutitdew3::good cleanup collison!
raytowson::come on you have got to bekidding me no way dallas blows this cover
Whutitdew3::collison come on..
boomdads75::Wish that Ray allen Mayo trade went down right about now - damn the C's could use him!
MafiosoSpaghetti::so many turnovers...sick mavs. they need to work on that
FanofTexas28::Just think how good our offense will be when Dirk gets back. Basketballgasm.
bluedevils1148::Poor effort defensively Sixers....
wyoxcdukie::Hey 76ers fans! I just published a book on the 2001 76ers called "The 76ers with Iverson: Reliving the Ride" available now on Amazon! With 48 pictures inside the book! Check it out here: http://www.amazon.com/76ers-Iverson-Reliving-Ride/dp/1479397954/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355889104&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=76ers
wyoxcdukie::The book with color pictures is expensive, I will admit. But a black and white version will be coming out shortly and that will be $13.99
bluedevils1148::When the price goes down to the paperback version.
PATSORGENOS2012::Shooting 30 3's isnt going to win us many games either....just hate how easy some of these buckets have come.  I know we are limited but damn, show some pride
Whutitdew3::if kaman could just rebound the ball and play some defense he would be awesome. idk if that will ever happen but here is to hoping
Whutitdew3::he did play some decent defense tonight though
FanofTexas28::OJ "I'll play for $2 million and do a damn good job of it" Mayo!
AdamFinesse::I knew Carlisle would bring the star out of him
potato623::2-7 in December
potato623::Lottery here we come so we can land another mediocre center
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::That's Game...............Go Mavs!!!
AdamFinesse::Timmy Duncan bank shot
Whutitdew3::OJ CLUTCH MAYO!
flyguys44::i hope doug collins rips this pathetic team a new one in practice tomorrow.... their play these past few games hase been horrible
PATSORGENOS2012::Collins "ok guys, lets give up 4 points in 35 seconds"  Solid coaching haha
potato623::Don't blame him, look at the s### talent he has to deal with
PATSORGENOS2012::Im not, tried to be sarcastic on that.  Def not his fault....
potato623::God I hate Hawes, a real center blocks both those layups
FanofTexas28::OJ "I Don't Give A F*ck" Mayo!!!
Whutitdew3::MAYO!
