Mavsolute_Beast_41::Thank you Blazers :)
MCprodi_G::It seems like the only Conversation boards that get more than 2000 comments are the Lakers boards. Usually because of haters though
TheHedonismBot::Heat, Knicks and Bulls threads usually get 2000 before the game even starts.

naahb::casey mack fully predicted linsanity. he basically explained everything that happened in linsanity, and predicted it in 2010!!! http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/2012/03/casey-mack-man-who-completely-predicted.html he's litterally a genious
marat75::JLin doesn't have dependable jumpers. At least not anymore. He's been going like 3 for 18 or something.
prezh601::this is a bad loss for the grizz... Rudy Gay needs to be more consistant.. he needs to work more on his hussle point seeing as he is guarding all the top players in the west..he was killed tonight
ripcitywonder::So Thabeet and Flynn were just aquired to relieve cap space for this next offseasoN? Are they never going to see significant minutes? I assume felton is as good as gone i wonder why flynn isn't seeing more time? I guess i could understand thabeet.
prezh601::Flynna vcan ball Thabeet needs to decide whether he wants to be sent out the league or go back to school for a degree..it makes no sense to not put the effort into your craft and make the right money not the garbage money
iamthebum::Felton turned it on recently, but Flynn has spent all of 3 days with the team...
TheHedonismBot::Season ends in April, genius.

royboy1978::Don't try to compare my job to what you do ona daily basis son.  I have a REAL job.
royboy1978::I wish the Grizz would get out of hibernation mode and get it together.

13alexrodriguez3::Gilbert Arenas will release some stress in the locker room... And some bullet shells.
