Sandman4141::I believe in the mavs. MFFL!
Barrk_40::The Mavs are inching ever closer to .500
adrudi775::Observation: The Mavs have an awful fan base
Dirk2XMVP::says the Jazz fan lol. Talk to me when your Jazz win a ring. Don't give me the MJ crap cause Mavs beat the Heat with only 1 Superstar in Dirk while the Heat had Lebron, Bosh, and Wade.
gt1master_ike::Damn we could have had Jack and Greivis. That would have been a great set of PGs.
Air McFly 2015::Down 4 with under 50 seconds to go. Win game by 4.
RUserious-2::I don't care what else happened in this game, I'm just glad to see Dirk score over 20 points again.
D12toHouston::Mavs and Lakers no playoffs this year.  How sweet it is.
dirkaqs41::SARGE!!!
Phat_Freida_Bosh::With every passing day, Vince Carter's legend grows But why are there so many haters, who the hell really knows? These $@%!$@% like to bash him, but who the hell are you? Sitting in your mamma's basement, nothing better to do I hope I've made it clear now, why Vince Carter is so great And why you stupid mother $#$#%#s really need to stop they hate Said I hope I've made it clear now, why Vince Carter is so great And why you stupid mother $#$#%#s really need to stop they hate
roll_n_riot::Great win, now shave your beards and keep the Lakers out of the playoffs
SF_Bay_Henri::Yeah Mavs Won
ITSATRAPFTW::Why does Sarge not play more, 7 blocks in 13 minutes sounds like something we need...
dogs::so MY Mavs won?
carlmatrix::I'll give credit for mayo's assists. he has a better assists than collison.
Justinkm83::Go Portland and SA! I think our best chance is GS's spot.
NotYourFathersESPN::Bernard James w 7 blocks in 13 minutes!? Is that right?
ITSATRAPFTW::The Mavs just need to focus on the winning part, if they win the majority of the games left, they will make the playoffs.
flankton::naw, the minutes in the box score are wrong... those are first half minutes
dirkaqs41::Thank you i was wondering whether they were playing college ball!
NotYourFathersESPN::And dirk w 25 pts in 22 min. If he keeps scoring like that this could get interesting
I3UTTON::good thing Golden State will lose to SA tonight
Justinkm83::It will be GS's spot, not Hou.
LetsGoMavs 2.0::but Houston keeps winning. THat is what sucks
LetsGoMavs 2.0::yes Sir. Should be an NBA record
LetsGoMavs 2.0::Vinsanity passed Larry Bird in NBA All Time Scoring like 2 weeks ago and today Vinsanity just passed Gary Payton!!  Go Vince and Go Mavs!!
carlmatrix::I really appreciate the mike james' 3. I thought we will lose. good job mike james.
carlmatrix::where is kaman? why he is not playing yet?
carlmatrix::We need kaman on sunday against the lakers. he can give flexibility on offense
I3UTTON::ya I agree. he's better than Brandan Wright at least.
All around rondo::because Brand is better than his lame $@%.
sandman2685::He still hasn't cleared from the injury...and we don't need him, we play better without him
I3UTTON::eh idk, I wouldn't mind having his offense off the bench.
I3UTTON::might be back Sunday
Justinkm83::Mayo couldn't buy a bucket at the end, but that was a huge TO he forced. I don't know about everyone else, but I had a feeling Anderson was going to knock down a 3 to win it.
basket_guru::VC was a beast tonight. glad to see him in that condition.
sandman2685::Typical of Lakers and their stupid fans overreacting to those comments, Mark just said that for Lakers to be under the cap, avoid the luxury tax and sign Dwight, they would have to amnesty Kobe...it was a suggestion...typical of Lakers dramatizing this
FanofTexas28::Just read what Cuban said. Lakers getting bootyhurt.
RUserious-2::He was right.  A lot of teams are going to be in trouble next year with the new CBA.  I have not liked what Cuban has done in the last 2 years, but that new CBA is going to put a lot of teams in big trouble.  You will be able to buy one super star and get one free.
MidWayMonster0023::Can I have a link of the story? I just read a headline that the Lakers were mad, haha so I don't even know what he said
Sarge blocks your shot::Cuban said they should amnesty Kobe.
I3UTTON::http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/8976442/los-angeles-lakers-call-mark-cuban-remarks-kobe-bryant-inappropriate
I3UTTON::they can't handle the truth
_Pyro27::They're getting $@%!$@%! because he's right.
All around rondo::Dirk Nowitzki&gt;Lakers
Omg its Darius::Lol we lost to the mavs
Omg its Darius::Idgaf
Justinkm83::Well you guys aren't good, so you played a team playing well to the end. There's your solace.
Justinkm83::5th best record in the NBA in Feb.
I3UTTON::Check this article, Fakers are b.utthurt over Cuban's comments lol:  http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/8976442/los-angeles-lakers-call-mark-cuban-remarks-kobe-bryant-inappropriate
outspoken mavs fan::Tyson Chandler is overrated
LetsGoMavs 2.0::Not going to say that. I like Tyson Chandler and we would have beaten the Thunder last year in the playoffs if we had him.
Justinkm83::Did my eyes just deceive me, or did we just win a close game?
fsuseminole88::and Srgt James with 7 blocks in 13 minutes along with Carter hitting 5 threes in 13 minutes*
Justinkm83::And 26 year old VC
Justinkm83::Sarcasm
outspoken mavs fan::36
LetsGoMavs 2.0::Vinsanity saved the Mavs with a CLUTCH 3
FanofTexas28::With Mike James running Point.
FanofTexas28::Either way we'll be in the 10th spot after tonight. If Portland wins, they jump us. If the Fakers win, we stay where we are.
LetsGoMavs 2.0::well at least the Fakers will have 30 loses while Mavs have 29 going into Sunday
LetsGoMavs 2.0::SteveCronin come out come out wherever you are. He's a Fakers fan LMAO
FanofTexas28::He is? I thought he was an OKC fan.
LetsGoMavs 2.0::I don't know. I'm just guessing
Sarge blocks your shot::He's mad about 2011.
All around rondo::yo yo this is real rappin, i throw you away like yesterdays underwear that i crapped in. Im better than Nowitz and i also have bigger wonder $@%!
All around rondo::dirk nowtizki&gt; everyone
LetsGoMavs 2.0::Can't wait to beat the Fakers on Sunday!!
FanofTexas28::Where you at steve cronin!?
I3UTTON::Mike James &gt; Steve Blake
menos el oso 41::Omg its Darius Are going to the playoffs this year um NO ........... this guy is the reincarnated oracle at delphi... the new seer has spoken!
Omg its Darius::O Well series tied 1-1 plus saints beat cowboys so I'm good
YoungCrizzy::Where are the haters at now talking about we where going to lose! Carter 3
FanofTexas28::OK I GUESS WE'RE ROOTING FOR PORTLAND GO BLAZERS
I3UTTON::Mavs&gt;Fakers
LetsGoMavs 2.0::On to watching the FAKERS lose to the Blazers!!!
wreckem tech101::GG Hornets Pelican whatever y'all are called nowadays, oh lord and still got 2 more against them, not easy at all. What do I keep saying....The Mavericks aint dead yet.....they still play hard and with heart and thats all i can ask for. Catch y'all at the next one....would go to the Rapid reaction but gotta work tomorrow so catch y'all at the next one. <b><u><i>MFFL</i></u></b>
_Pyro27::You gotta work on a Saturday? That blows
wreckem tech101::yep....on most Saturdays too am out
Sarge blocks your shot::Charlotte Hornets &gt; New Orleans Hornets  Mugsy Bogues &gt; Austin Rivers
FullMetalx317::I have to say though that New Orleans has a bright future. Vasquez is a legit PG who can easily be one of the best in a few years. Really do enjoy watching him play.
jvdesigns2002::The pelicans deserved to lose--in what f'n world does a coach bench a rookie big man in the 4th quarter who has a double/double through 3 quarters? Monty Williams is absolute garbage, and the karma gods bit him for being such a d-bag.
FanofTexas28::Who should we root for? Portland or LA?
47riley47::Well that does it  GO PORTLAND
LetsGoMavs 2.0::PORTLAND ALL DAY. I HATE THE FAKERS LAKERS
_Pyro27::Portland for sure.
YoungCrizzy::portland we need la to lose
FullMetalx317::Portland.
FanofTexas28::I hate them too, but either way it helps the Mavs.
TheJTram::Well...Portland needs to win to keep the Lakers further away from the playoffs
I3UTTON::def Portland
47riley47::Portland
menos el oso 41::portland... screw the lakers
I3UTTON::Can't wait to see this Mavs team fully healthy again. Hopefully Kaman and Morrow will be available Sunday.
huhmyniegurl6::Is it over yet what a long 3 sec
menos el oso 41::woo-hoo.... we beat the hornets.... by 4....
Omg its Darius::O Well series tied 1-1 plus saints beat cowboys so I'm good
Omg its Darius::Blazers??????????
Omg its Darius::O Well series tied 1-1 plus saints beat cowboys so I'm good
LetsGoMavs 2.0::Don't even compare the garbage Hornets franchise to the Mavs. No comparison at all   Talk to me when your Hornets make the playoffs 12 years in a row since 2000 with 11 50+ win seasons and 2 NBA FINALS App in 2006 and 2011
LetsGoMavs 2.0::O 1 bad year. This is like the Mavs first year missing the playoffs since 1999. Big deal. How many losing seasons have the Hornets had?
Omg its Darius::Are mavs going to the playoffs this year um NO
menos el oso 41::you also beat us in bounty gate scandals
FanofTexas28::My Chiefs beat the Saints. Lololol.
Him Down Stairs::ALL NBA TEAMS &gt; PELICANS
