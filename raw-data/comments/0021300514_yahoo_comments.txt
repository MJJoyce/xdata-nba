Guest::FOR THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED- I WON'T COME BACK TO READ HATE REPLIES NOR COMMENTS POSTED ABOUT ME SO ENJOY WASTING TIME REPLYING TO YOURSELVES & ENJOY YOUR STUPIDITY LOL  Spurs gave up a 100+ points as USUAL. Like I said Spurs beat weak to average teams but the losses they have now are from elite teams. They can't beat the Thunder (10-2 in last 10 games vs Spurs), Heat, Pacers, nor Blazer in a best of 7 games. Spurs give up 100+ points a game, lack defense, lack 7 footers, lack rebounders, & rely on 3 pointers. Where were the Spurs fans when they CHOKED in the Finals? Prentis P, Tay, BB, Terry, Shaw, Phillip, Straitballin, Chapscat, Moses, Donald, proudveteranwoman, Guest, etc? I watched NBA for 27 years & I never seen a team so pathetic & choke like the Spurs. Double digit lead in the 4th, up by 5 with 28 seconds left, Leonard missed 1 freethrow to close out the Finals & Pop took out his rebounders & starters at the end like an idiot! They CHOKED as USUAL LOL. THIS IS THE 5TH SEASON I WILL SAY IT, SPURS WON'T WIN THE TITLE!
Anton::Spurs choking as usual. Please tell me how these bunch of old bums will win a game in the playoffs.
Paulie::James Johnson should be starting over Prince.
donald::Z-Bo can't Z-Bo on a regular basis anymore.  It's gonna be a rough year for Grizz fans.  So many expectations, and only Conley has improved.
Tom A::Way to close out a game Spurs. Up 12 with 1:59 left and we go to OT! We don't need Duncan and Parker playing those extra minutes, geesh.
Prentis P::Everytime parker plays a top guard his #$%$ is hush man whats up with that tony... Dammm go spurs...
Guest::Pulling a win out of your as(s) is better then having a loss shoved up your as(s). GSG!!
Chinesse food fan::We are going to have more close games like this with Splitter out... Adding extra minutes now to other key players with only Ayres to kinda replace him. Get Healed quick Splitter...
Robert::GO GINOBILI GO!!!!! GO SPURS GO!!!!!
Vlad::ginobilli is so clutch!
