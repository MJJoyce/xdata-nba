zinkerled::Nash once again proven to be the best shooter in the league: http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/38310/a-new-look-at-the-nbas-best-shooters
Meet-The-Forkers::Great game PHX! Sorry I missed it.
John Gat::Hey Pacer fans, your team sucks, that is all.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::yay...
nahhb::nba draft, all nba players are eligible where would u guys put nash? this site had him 29th, seemed generous http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::no big deal, just need to be in the top 6 for playoffs
so_chi_city::Steve continues to be 1 of my top 5 favorite players in the league.
Ray Allen Fan91::http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/detail.nhn?titleId=350217&amp;no=31&amp;weekday=tue
shartmaster69::wow nash is sick!  imagine if derrick rose had a tenth of the court vision!
PhxSunsOwn13::Im out. GG Pacers and Go Suns!
roy hibbert gooder kisser::im headed out. kisses for everyone. luv ya ta bits, i wana kiss u on the lips
PhxSunsOwn13::lol later. GG
arizonasportsman::Well that sucks Suns won another game. Going to be a miserable draft night.
Aaron14488::cant stand fans that root for losses... in my opinion you're not a fan.  As a fan you should want the same thing as your players and I guarantee there isnt a player on this team that is hoping or trying for losses.  These guys are competitors and want to win... period!!
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::First time I have agreed with anyone who likes byu! ;) Yeah that's the dumbest thing ever to cheer your team on to lose.... dumb. Go JAZZ go UTES
PhxSunsOwn13::Dude I actually like being later in the lottery or in the 15-16 spot. This draft is so deep this year man, picks 8-20 are basically the same talent level.
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::Remember: Sports junkies rule and news hounds suck.
PhxSunsOwn13::what does this mean?
iownamicrowave::refs can srew any NBA team over they want, and there is nothing the teams can do about it beause the gestapo (NBA) will come down on them.
Aaron14488::If you honestly believed that then why even watch the games???
iownamicrowave::What do you mean if I honestly believe it... it's true.  Players, coaches, gms are not allowed to criticize officiating or they are hit with a hefty fine.  So if a game is unfairly called-- its kept inhouse.  I guess i just have to hope they are truly trying to call it even.....
iownamicrowave::its a screwed up system, the nba can essentially allow any team to win and no one can question it.
PhxSunsOwn13::exactly. the sickest part of it is they pretty much do the same in the playoffs... whoever the league wants to win, wins.
PhxSunsOwn13::this is true, we usually ALWAYS are on the other end up this though... kinda weird for a change being the team that benefits
the myth.::like the suns i hope they take over the clippers spot
PhxSunsOwn13::Love watching "Thob City" fall! Id be okay taking Denvers spot or either of Houston or LAC's spot.
the myth.::i like the rockets too nuggets and clippers idc for
PhxSunsOwn13::ESPN, Y U NO LET ME KEEP MY COMMENTS? YOU MODS ARE SUCH TOOLS
roy hibbert gooder kisser::lol i saw ur comment deleted
PhxSunsOwn13::yeah this is ridiculous... haha I asked for it though
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::Fouling was the right thing to do. Better to to make the opponent have to do 4 things right. (make  rebthe first,miss the second,get the  rebound and score.) instead of allowing them to tie the game by doing one thing right by just making one shot.
PhxSunsOwn13::agreed
roy hibbert gooder kisser::thats not how we play on the STREETS
PhxSunsOwn13::Hey ESPN, you suck. You suck, ESPN. Delete this comment, I dare you.
Rick-Da-Villain::Pacers fans didn't say nothing about the refs when their team beat da bulls...but complaining now when the shoe is on the other foot..Smdh
nblucas97::Just to refresh your memory, the fouls were even when the Pacers beat the Bulls. Not a 10 foul difference and blatant misses. Nice try bozo.
iownamicrowave::the refs don't call against the bulls get out of here.  you are a fan of a big market team, you can't even be in this discussion. they hand u guys games.
buller23::moron. a corn fed moron
NGplayinskillz::Grant Hill CLEARLY TRAVELED ON THAT ONE JUMPSHOT WHERE HE JUMPED AND THEN LANDED in a different spot Without shooting the Ball. Yet the Refs did NOT call it.
roy hibbert gooder kisser::WTF!!!!!!!!! WHATS SO BAD ABOUT EVEN MENTIONING THAT I KISSED THE WALL?!?! I $@%!$@ SPELLED OUT $@%!$ AND YET U CHOSE NOT TO DELETE THAT??? I WAS ACTUALLY PROUD OF THAT LINE
PhxSunsOwn13::lol ESPN hates you...
roy hibbert gooder kisser::i know... they already killed off roy hibbert good kisser and roy hibberts kissin booth
iownamicrowave::Grant hill pulled Paul george to the ground on the last shot, phx was given this game.  horridly called game
roy hibbert gooder kisser::WHO KEEPS DELETING MY KISSING THE WALL LINE; THATS SOME GOOD $@%!!!! WHICH ONE OF U PHOENIX FANS ARE $@%!$@ FLAGGIN IT
PhxSunsOwn13::I actually thought that one was funny. And flagging is for pus.sies
PhxSunsOwn13::Channing Frye should be ashamed for missing both those FT's and letting them even have a chance in the first place.
Rick-Da-Villain::What's the Magic number for the Central Title??
roy hibbert gooder kisser::SO PISSED!!!!!!! JUST KISSED MY WALL SO HARD THAT THERES A HOLE IN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PhxSunsOwn13::Blaming the refs... nothing new. Whichever team loses always uses that excuse, lol I was in the same boat when the Heat got the game handed to them vs. us.
adavisrc09::Karma  Earl Hickey
ooqqoo::Did you watch the game?  Or are you so biased you didn't bother to notice?  Phoenix guys were constantly fouling and pushing without calls.  Pacers got called for touch foul after touch foul.  Just look at the PF/FT differential.  It's ridiculous, especially considering the styles of play.  That or the BS offensive foul on one end and then the OBVIOUS no-call on a Grant Hill travel?  This game was ridiculously biased for the AWAY team.
NGplayinskillz::The REFS REALLY DID SCREW UP THIS GAME. IT IS NOT EVEN AN EXCUSE WHEN THE REFS ARE THIS BAD.
roy hibbert gooder kisser::dude, didnt u miss most of the game? u cant talk
PhxSunsOwn13::I watched the entire first half and the 4th quarter... big deal I missed one quarter.
Valley of the Gods 335::Extra: Steve Nash owns Fraud-iana again
NGplayinskillz::Good Game Phoenix but THE REFS SUCKED THIS GAME.  I HATE NBA REFS SO MUCH.
oinkpiggies::I didn't see the game, but all I can say is hopefully it all evens out in the end. Look, the reason Basketball pisses me off sometimes is because unlike many other sports, officiating is a HUGE part of the game. Two calls or no calls can basically decide a game. Screw that, one call can do it... so you can imagine a whole game.  Every team has games where they get screwed in the $@% by the officials. That's how the NBA works. Suns get f**cked, you guys get F**ked.. etc. So to look at one game, and be pissed, well there's really no point. I am pretty sure you guys had games go in your favour too. Frustrating yes, but until we get robot officials, it's gonna happen. Humans make mistakes. And it's really easy in basketball where everything happens so fast, and a finger close to a guy's arm can be called.
tiago_1801::pacers 1-9 when allow 100 or more points  and I can't believe they allowed 113 pts against this $@%! old $@%!$@% team
RG3inD.C.::refs sucked extra hard tonight
nblucas97::What a disgusting way for a game to end.
ikedrk::Total Horse $@%!.
RG3inD.C.::damnit
Sobralll::Leandro Barbosa.... brazilian... shame
tiago_1801::o que você quer dizer palhaço?
roy hibbert gooder kisser::$@%! u phoenix. sure fouling is smart but its such a way to p.ussy out!!! and that was a foul on hill on that last shot
spenny18::im a huge suns fan! he is right that is such p.ussy bu.ll sh&amp;t
PhxSunsOwn13::U mad. lol
roy hibbert gooder kisser::JUST KISSED MY WALL SO HARD!!!! NOW THERES A HOLE IN IT
PhxSunsOwn13::GG Pacers. Needed this win badly. Go Suns!! Gotta beat the Cavs tomorrow!
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::It's Sunday not tomorrow. Noon as time. Looking forward to winning it.
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::YES!!!!!! Suns win!. This is a big win. We should beat Cleveland on Sunday to go 2-2 on the road trip. Still have an outside shot at the playoffs,but we need the Rockets to lose a few. With this win I'll sleep loads better tonight than I have all week. GO SUNS!!!!!! :)
PhxSunsOwn13::Damn....... so close.
Valley of the Gods 335::Nash = superhero
Sobralll::Leandro Barbosa.... brazilian... shame
tiago_1801::vtnc fdp
the myth.::good foul
PhxSunsOwn13::Eastern Conference is so top heavy... outside of the Heat and Bulls all the other teams would be lucky to be a top 6 seed in the West. Suns easily would be the 6th or 7th seed in the East with the easier schedule... playing the Wizards, Nets,Bobcats, Raptors, Cavs, Bucks, and even Knicks aren't that good, dont have that in the West.
KENNY-----------POWERS::magic
rob111111113::1 more shot left
KENNY-----------POWERS::wowser...
rob111111113::It's not over yet
roy hibbert gooder kisser::ok ok... the refs did screw us over, but we really cant defend the pick and roll, and steve nash is the master of it, so i give phoenix credit. that being said, Phoenix, u are not making the playoffs. sorry but its just not happening. please set steve nash free; dont let him rot in the hot desert sun. im not saying this as a pacers fan, but purely as a basketball fan
IAmJonasJones::if the suns were in the east they'd make it... the East has been terrible for over a decade now
roy hibbert gooder kisser::not gonna lie, that is true
KENNY-----------POWERS::says roy hibbert gooder kisser....
PhxSunsOwn13::Houston isnt that good, we are better and will make it over them. Mark my words.
screwhead2305::Houston is good. only team you have a chance of passing would be the Nuggets or Grizzlies
PhxSunsOwn13::Choke.....
PhxSunsOwn13::WTF CHANNING.... YOU SUCK.
PhxSunsOwn13::Remember when the Suns SWEPT the Spurs off the court in the playoffs in 2010?!
tiago_1801::we are in 2012
PhxSunsOwn13::Nash is the best PG in the league. FACT.
