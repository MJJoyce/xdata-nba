Tony Anthony::Wow. It's like every Wizards player excluding Wall is trying to deliberately lose the game.
Jimmy Neutron::Wow, the Atlantic division is terrible!
chuck d::Bradley Beal a superstar in the making
Eric::Wizards suck balls !  Go RAPS !  Atlantic is ours !
RAY B::Raps have a thing for lousy 3rd quarters..why? coaching?. 6-7 isnt anything special but after last years 4-19 start I will take it.
Tony Anthony::Oh and Wittman sucks! He always subs out the players that have ANY kind of rhythm. Why not build on that? Because of his #$%$ coaching the Wizards have lost many 4th quarter leads. He needs to be fired.
RAY B::Rudy is 2-10..Watching  him shoot is painful. So many bad shots. Keeps reminding me of the Seinfeld episode where they call George the "chucker" cause he shoots from anywhere (or something like that).Rudy is a "chucker".
signalh::about time Wall shows some life... http://voices.yahoo.com/washington-wizards-2013-14-winning-ingredients-12395990.html?cat=14
Jao-Juen::I guess Danny Ainge was trying to win another championship this year. With the spring chicken coach and kris Humphris playing like my two years old boy, Celtics has everything to win now!
Commenter::Just saying who the hell is James Anderson and why the hell is he starting. If you claim to know who he is before researching him, i guarantee you youre lying
