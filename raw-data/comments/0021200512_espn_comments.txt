Juan37131::dis thing sucks that we lost against a playoff team that we beat last year
Rossi46Doctor::Dang, you guys lost again? Can't beat the top teams in the East?
TwiztidKennyD::Hey Heat fans!!!! I hope the Birdman comes to South Beach.  The Rodman for the Bulls, is the BIRDMAN for the HEAT!!!
wickd_waze::i think he should start if not with heat another team that needs a spark
nba is the worst::Anyone hear?  The Sonics were good and Stern helped his buddy Clay Bennett steal them for a cowtown with nothing else happening in the state, and ridiculously included Seattle's championship in the deal.  Now the Kings are coming from Sacramento as a consolation prize, and they're terrible.  Poor seattle fans got hosed twice.
Djuki 3::that's business

Drew6855::Indiana fans can't wait either, we get D. Granger back in Feb.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::February baby...cant wait (Bart Scott voice)
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Anyone hear? New Expansion teams, The "Miami Heat", "Orlando Magic" and "Minnesota Timberwolves" are  being created.

What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Dem_Canes_Man - What Did I do 15 is back just like The U - Dem_Canes_Man - What Did I do 15 is back just like The U - Heat should fit in nice with our Monster Canes with stars like Steve Walsh and future legend HC Jimmy Johnson and our Fins with Marino, right?  ---Steve Walsh?? Nice!!!!!!  Future NFL star bruh.  ---I know...I know. I forgot that he played for the U.  Nah, actually he bombed in the NFL. Had one good year on the Saints I think.

hoops 112hoping::people who think paul george can only shoot are stupid. He got by the NBA God (Lebron!!) multiple times and hit tough fadeways and layups over him. Haters
lebron-is-a-champion::cool
lebron-is-a-champion::hola
Dem_Canes_Man::Ho-------------La
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Anyone hear? Vancouver Grizzlies to move to Memphis.
Dem_Canes_Man::Bad move.
Herbin Guerilla::lolz
FunkVolumeOF::So the pacers have beat the Bulls twice and the Heat once, and everyone is still talking about the heat and bulls last two in east. Mainstream team fans... So stuck up.
Drew6855::Rose is great, no doubt, but the Bulls as a whole are &lt; Indiana
Drew6855::Hahahahaha. I know you fear Indiana and just trying to sound brave, it's okay
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::BULLS NO FEAR #SEEREDNATION BABY!! Our MVP &gt; Granger. Even you cant deny it
Drew6855::And Bulls will be 5th or 6th place.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::LOL, im sure you're just shaking in your boots for #TheReturn. Understandable
Drew6855::And Indiana will get D. Granger back too, what's your point?
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Point is simple: Indy will be the 2nd Placers. ;)
FunkVolumeOF::Bulls are under .500 "ain't gonna cut it."
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::and D rose will be back after ASB "definitely will cut it"
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::beat the bulls twice? LOL you played us once buddy remember?
Herbin Guerilla::The Pacers are a .500 team on the road.  That is not going to cut it
Drew6855::The Heat are a .500 team on the road too.
Dem_Canes_Man::Postseason is a different animal.
Herbin Guerilla::Anyone hear? Kings to Seattle.  ?
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Anyone care? that should be the question
KingLebriansKarateKid::"you dudez is boring, im ballin like im lebrian" -chief keef
Dem_Canes_Man::The NBA will start to crank up after the All Star break, but I can't wait until the postseason.  The NBA should cut the season to 60 games.
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::I don't even pay much attention until after the NFL season.
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Chargers, Kings and Padres? Life as a San Diego/Sacremento sports fan must suck.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::just like the Kings "fans" if any exist. Lol
Herbin Guerilla::MLB should cut it to 60
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::so heat could win every year right? Lol
Dem_Canes_Man::No....but the season is too long.
cbbaseball19::It will happen in a full season too
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Anyone hear? Kings to Seattle.
Herbin Guerilla::lolz
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::no one cares. Kings died 10 years ago
Herbin Guerilla::no way!   *extreme sarcasm*
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Apparently this is old news. $@%! you ESPN News updates.
Herbin Guerilla::The problem with the Pacers is they can't win on the road.
Drew6855::Beat the Bulls on the road. Indiana WILL be #1 in Central
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::the Pacers will be the Second Placers after all star break
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::I meant second in the CENTRAL Division buddy. BULLS
Herbin Guerilla::So who is going to be first and second in the east at the ASB???
KingLebriansKarateKid::and lance stephenson starts for them. LOL
Drew6855::Lance is a beast
Shumpcomeback13::To put it in perspective. Paul George is a very good young player. Along with wall and cousins the most talented player of the 2010 draft ahead of turner, monroe and favors. In no way is he a superstar, but he has the potential to be a borderline allstar, who could average 25, 9 and 4 in his prime. Right now he is on a fringe allstar level with occasional superstar type game outbursts. Give him 2 years and he´ll be a top 15 player in the league. But to reach that level the pacers need to trade granger for a scoring sg. Stephenson is solid but not a starter on a good team. George is definately a sf and not a sg -&gt; granger for lets say someone like eric gordon.
Drew6855::George is a penetrater, shooter, and defensive beast.
Shumpcomeback13::how about tyreke for granger, pacers desperately need penetration cause hill, west and george are mainly shooters
Shumpcomeback13::but noone read it...
Shumpcomeback13::but noone commented
cbbaseball19::We saw it the first time...........
cbbaseball19::I stopped after Paul.  Im pretty sure this was posted down below....
Dem_Canes_Man::Why would NO give up EG for Granger?
Djuki 3::i think you posted this already
Herbin Guerilla::So if the playoffs started today the Heat would play the Celtics in series one.  Then the Heat would play the winners of the Pacers v Bulls series  Then probably the Knicks in the ECF....If they could make it through.  That is a tough road....
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::The Knicks better pray they dont play the Bulls. The TRUE team of the east besides the Cheat
Drew6855::Lame Bulls fans don't know when their time is over. LMAO
cbbaseball19::one*
nba is the worst::Why would the heat beat the Celtics?
Djuki 3::Knicks might be cursed ever since the "cold" lottery ball that landed them Ewing =P
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::LOL FACT
Herbin Guerilla::that was so Lucky on our part!   *extreme sarcasm*
koke001::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0LKE4Onoks
heitz13::they had a hell of a run until they got jobbed in the WCF against the Lakers.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::theyve been dead for 10 years lol
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::different time now. KJ did all he could to keep them in Sac. And im sure the fans are accepting of the circumstances now.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Meh its whatever. Cali has 4 teams anyways, im sure 3 is fine too. lol
koke001::Yea, but I still feel bad for them
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Dem_Canes_Man - But the real question is......when will D. Rose return the MVP to its rightful owner? -------------------------------------------------------------------------- He was gonna return it to LBJ but after that embarrassing loss to the Roseless Bulls he decided he didn't deserve it.
cbbaseball19::Lebron doesnt worry about regular season..........
cbbaseball19::He got a ring, I dont think hes worried.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::He must not worry about finals either... 1-3
Herbin Guerilla::Varejao's out 8 weeks........  SHOCKER
koke001::I feel sorry for Sacramento fans
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::plus...what fans? Lol
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::they didnt go to the games.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::they dont want a team bad enough man. Trust me.
koke001::It's not their fault they have a terrible owner and a crappy team
Dem_Canes_Man::But the real question is......when will D. Rose return the MVP to its rightful owner?  I like the kid...but do what is right Derrick.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::LOL...heat fan logic
cbbaseball19::Bron doesnt appreciate Derrick keeping it from him
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::RRC24Kemba15 - Knicks Fan Since the other Week - Bulls match up great with the Heat. They surely have the recipe to beat them and hopefully can do it during playoffs.  how do you figure, bc they can rebound? the Pacers matchup, Bulls dont imo ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you look at the past 2 seasons the Heat seem to have problems with the Bulls.  Yes the Heat beat them during playoffs but those games came down to the last few minutes.  Thibs seem to have the recipe to beat the Heat..... Pacers seem to also have it now..
method305::But neither of them could do it when it counted.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::FACT
Herbin Guerilla::Djuki starting trouble again.  Getting everybody riled up.
Djuki 3::haha no, i'm a peacemaker, i don't like trouble :)
cbbaseball19::hes a smart man.  You should hear his poems.....
Dem_Canes_Man::What real Heat fan were worried being down 2-1 last year with Bron and Wade?  Come on Pacer fans......let's be real here.
Drew6855::Except for every team in the league.
heitz13::easy to say that now
Dem_Canes_Man::Nobody is afraid of the Pacers dude.  I am sorry.
Djuki 3::if the 2008 draft wasn't rigged, Miami would have had Derrick Rose ;), you're welcome Bulls
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Hahaha not crying are we? I always have to deal with 4-1 from you guys
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::like how rigged the ECFs were 2 years ago too? ;) loll
Djuki 3::lol not crying, just pointing something out :)
Herbin Guerilla::here we go.  please don't get them started.
cbbaseball19::FACT!
whatsanoa::Hard to win when the ENTIRE team, except three players, score 11 points TOTAL
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Heat will not make it to the Finals.......   Last years Heat was beating teams over 20 points easily each night left and right.  The only team maybe capable of beating the Heat was the Bulls and with that Pacers and Celtics gave the Heat a lot of work.  This years Heat have struggled to beat at best average teams and is not like the are blowing them out as they did last year (since early in the season).  Knicks, Pacers, Bulls, Celtics, one of these teams will send the Heat home.
Shumpcomeback13::lets not overreact this is not warriors vs mavs part 2
cbbaseball19::I will throw your shoe into the crowd if you keep talking all this garbage!
RRC24Kemba15::bucks do always seem to give the heat fits
RunTheBall22._::don't forget the bucks. heat fear the dear
Shumpcomeback13::hahaha jennings and ellis wont do $@%! in the playoffs but I do agree that sanders and mbah a moute would be very effective vs penetration and containing lebron, wade.... 4:2 heat
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Bottom feeders of the central division
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::B U L L S in the ECF BOOK IT!!
Drew6855::Nah, Indiana in ECF, Bulls go home in first round
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Because the past is totally relevant to the present right? LOL alrite stick to ur opinion. The facts are there
RRC24Kemba15::ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing - how about DEFENSE AND REBOUNDING?! we would MURK THEM  u just lost 4-1 to them when you had a better team. you not murking anyone
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::how about DEFENSE AND REBOUNDING?! we would MURK THEM
RRC24Kemba15::ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing - WITH ROSE!! Hes back after the Allstar Break!  ok, they'd matchup much better with rose. i still question their scoring ability, bench, and 3 pt shooting to beat the heat 4 out of 7. id prob say heat in 6.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::WITH ROSE!! Hes back after the Allstar Break!
RRC24Kemba15::ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing - Dont matchup? Explain  tell me how they matchup? with rose or withour rose are we speaking?
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Dont matchup? Explain
RRC24Kemba15::Knicks Fan Since the other Week - Bulls match up great with the Heat. They surely have the recipe to beat them and hopefully can do it during playoffs.  how do you figure, bc they can rebound? the Pacers matchup, Bulls dont imo
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::RRC24Kemba15 - i dont think the bulls can score enough to beat the heat in a series, without D Rose anyway.  And He WILL BE BACK after All star...so anything goes! BOOK IT
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Bulls match up great with the Heat.  They surely have the recipe to beat them and hopefully can do it during playoffs.
RRC24Kemba15::i dont think the bulls can score enough to beat the heat in a series, without D Rose anyway.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Bettter not! Quest for Seven coming up!
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::^ Don't have a issue with that.
Shumpcomeback13::To put it in perspective. Paul George is a very good young player. Along with wall and cousins the most talented player of the 2010 draft ahead of turner, monroe and favors.

George is definately a sf and not a sg -&gt; granger for lets say someone like eric gordon.
RunTheBall22._::funny how the heat fans think just because a team didn't win one year they have no shot the next. players get better, more comfortable in the system, chemistry is big and experience. this is exactly how they heat got better but even after watching what time can do for a team they refuse to acknowledge it can do the same for other teams. odd don't you think ?
Drew6855::And Indiana, different team, different season. Pacers take Central
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::like for the BULLS!! Different team Different season! BULLS BABY
RunTheBall22._::bulls is a great example, basically the same team last year but was so much better! and all you heard was if they couldn't do it the year before they can't do it now. lol
Herbin Guerilla::So are the Kings really moving to Seattle?
koke001::Unfortunately, Kings belong in Sacramento
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::they're garbage wherever they play
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::yup
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::blame the ownership. But now we wont have to hear seattle fans b.itch and moan. LOL
Herbin Guerilla::wtf?  It makes the OKC move look re.tarded
Herbin Guerilla::Dale Davis vs. Anthony Mason  Classic matchup
Dem_Canes_Man::Mason by spit-decision
Herbin Guerilla::If the Pacers had Dale Davis still they would win it all.  That MoFo was an ENFORCER!
Taco with a Q::Dale was a BEAST in his prime.  One of my favorite Pacer ever
Djuki 3::and Rick Smits
Dem_Canes_Man::Haywood Workman?
Road dog Red::He's a Ref now
Dem_Canes_Man::I mean, who are we kidding here:  The Pacers getting to the Finals....child please.
Drew6855::Which center was it that only grabbed 5 rebounds, oh yeah, that was Bosh. LMAO
Thehorseshoe20::oh the guy the grabbed 14 rebounds last night against your Miami Floppers
Thehorseshoe20::David Stern will make sure Indiana isnt in the finals
Dem_Canes_Man::Wrong!  Roy Hibbert will make sure of that.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Pacers have been getting better each year.  You have to respect and see how they have come together as a team.  They gave Chicago a run for in 2010 playoffs, last year they gave the heat a good run too.  I wouldn't be to confident about your heat walking past the Pacers that easily.
Taco with a Q::you know Im right too,  dont try to BS me little boy
Dem_Canes_Man::Taco with a Q - Ill agree there, Any Heat fan saying they werent worried after game 3 last year are LIARS!!  ---ha!
Taco with a Q::Ill agree there, Any Heat fan saying they werent worried after game 3 last year are LIARS!!
Dem_Canes_Man::Never said "easily", but somebody needs to simmer down.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Ever since the Flopping Penalty, the Heat cannot handle playing physical Teams.  Last year the "flops" bailed them out.  This year they are in huge trouble.
Road dog Red::Doesn't seem to bother the Nets
cbbaseball19::Be careful, Wade might throw your shoe off the court........
Thehorseshoe20::i was cracking up last night at the game, watching wade and lebron cry to the refs evrytime they missed a shot.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Last night and today feel like Christmas all over again.
cbbaseball19::Look whos here.........
Herbin Guerilla::It has changed things a bit huh?
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I would say more than a bit.
koke001::Waaaaahhhhh
koke001::That's the sound you make every day when you come to the Heat boards
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Not only do the players cry in the locker room but now the fans?
