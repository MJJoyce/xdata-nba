thanbai206::i cant believe Vegas rig this game like this 98-94 with 33s and no foul... are u serious???
gasol1883::What I love is that I was dogging on Conley earlier today, and two guys were calling me dumb and backing him up. I said that if Conley plays tonight the game would be real tight, and that if he sat the Griz would win big. No surprise Conley plays and the Griz have to make a huge comeback in the fourth, while his $@% is on the bench no doubt, just to win. Great win for the team, and another sad defensive performance by Conley. The Warriors third string point guard, Nate "punk $@%" Robinson out played Mike Conley, no surprise to me, but some of you guys need to open your eyes.
lightbulbthinh::The Warriors only play 3 quarters. Perfect fit for Lebron
rhowe982::Who the hell is Charles Jenkins no offense i am sure he deserves to be in the NBA, but i have never heard of him?
WarriorsGO::Rookie
rhowe982::Who the hell is Jeremy Tyler no offense i am sure he deserves to be in the NBA, but i have never heard of him?
WarriorsGO::Rookie
Charbear1180::The Warriors are going town hill now. Stupid them trading freakin' Monta Ellis and Ekpe Udoh. What idiots!
Pebster49::ya im glad they are tanking. Hopefully enough to get a good pick
neuroman::Uh, they are trying to be better for next season. They weren't going to do anything this season anyway. Better to be horrible now and good later than mediocre forever.
maxboltz619::For the last time, fucc the grizzlies!
Kee0130::For the last time Fucc you too! Did you like it?
royboy1978::And FU(K you too!!!!!!!
royboy1978::Time for this Grizz fan to move on.  Good series Warrior fans.  Maybe next year.
Oaktown1029::Conley came out with Oden at Ohio State, things have worked out better for him than Oden. He's still very young. I think he's going to get much better.
jzalvarado::Wow and to think this game may be a Bay Area classic for years to come.. San Francisco Warriors vs. San Jose Grizzlies
SlamDharma::He can afford it.
MWaugTigerFan::Grizz can't leave Memphis till 2020 cause of the contract with the city. You would have to pay the city the  same amount that you payed the owner for the team. Which in the case of the Guy who wanted to buy the grizzly and bring them San Jose that would be 350 mill. He would have to pay that to us as well. So the total would be 700 mill... good luck with that
WarriorsGO::Lol that guy has Billions of dollars. He could afford that easy
royboy1978::HELL NO!!!!!  GRIZZ AINT LEAVING MEMPHIS!!!!!!
soxfan123123::RoyBoy1978 is a perverted man (rapis.t)
royboy1978::Oh and liking your own post is pathetic.
royboy1978::Wrong kid.  I don't have to view po.rn sites or brag about banging my girlfriend on a sports site like some of you losers do (especially you soxfan).
Thesith36::WELL WELL....  Wheres all those Over pickers ??? Bwa hahahahahahahahaahaha  aaaaaaa   hahahahahahaahahahaha  UNDERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
WarriorsWarrior::You guys think it's still realistic we can keep our pick?
ataddy::Yes. We lost today and Detroit and Toronto won. Sacramento won yesterday. WE'RE CLOSING IN
Kee0130::Do you people really think Golden State loss on purpose? You can't be serious, the Grizzlies are a pressure team. They thrive off pressure and being down 12 early in the 4th made them grind even harder! Let's go Grizz, we can beat anybody! Grizz Nation!
jonty_1981::They were up against a pathetic team like nets the other day by 16 points into the 4th quarter. Warriors doubled there turnovers in last quarter. I think they had 7 in last quarter so I think they players are involved. It's called a losing bonus
jzalvarado::Wait?!  There's a Grizz 'nation'?!?!  jk dude good luck with your team rest of season.  I enjoy watching the Grizz bang it inside
Kee0130::Im not a dude! I am a woman, but thanks!
CreamySteeler366::Grit and grind. Grit and grind
soxfan123123::No the bulls, heat, spurs, thunder in a 7 game series
WarriorsWarrior::Players No! Owners Yes!
Oaktown1029::Coach Jackson: "all right guys, you know what to do - we have to get a top 7 pick - because you know all #7's turn into be franchise players and you younger guys who might be demoralized by us "tanking" and lose your confidence - oh well, sorry!."  Tanking is a loser's attitutude - these are professionals we're talking about!
jzalvarado::My view is that you play your best.  If you are the 10th worst team come season's end, then so be it.  You build off of that.
Oaktown1029::word
jzalvarado::I wish I could 'Like' your comment more than once
Monte Irvin::ah to be young again
Brewer4Prez::Grizz needed that one with three tough ones coming up.
royboy1978::Soxfan is some horn.y toad that truly wants to get laid.  He better wrap it up because I would hate to see how his child will turn out.
soxfan123123::Here's today's deals: $5- sucky  $10- fuc.ky
Trapped in Golden State::tanking is for teams playing for 2013...curry, lee, bogut plus thompson and a lottery pick is what we're playing for...for more tanking talk http://trappedingoldenstate.blogspot.com/2012/03/warriors-incompetence-finally-paying.html and an open letter to Joe Lacob coming tomorrow morning! Till then GO DUBS! Keep the tanking alive! Get that pick and get a head start on 2013!!!
Brewer4Prez::Enough with the gambling addicts running their mouths this is a conversation board for actual fans who pull for teams not spreads.
Brewer4Prez::Meaningless for you but for us we are battling for a playoff spot and seeding.
jzalvarado::Well im not too much against the Gambling Degenerates.  They keep the convo moving during a meaningless baasketballl game.  As A Warriors fan, there's usually only about three or four of us chatting about the game, and I haven't even been on this last week
SB4LlFE::that's because the majority of W's fans don't post on this board. Thee are 2 other main boards out there you can go to.
Brewer4Prez::no

Doc Emmett L Brown::Golden State: Tanking is for cowards. That is all.
WarriorsWarrior::Tanking....hahaha! Yeah we could have beaten Memphis in their house if we really wanted to! lol.

PJ31::how can you be down 4 with 30 secs to go and not foul???????????????????
maxboltz619::yup I totally agree, that was way too obvious, down 4 and waited until 19 seconds at least...
1216austin::tanking
jonty_1981::What about the fact they down by 4 with 11 seconds to go but only jack up a shot with 3 seconds to go.
PJ31::Ok.....Makes sense now, thanks!!!!
buggzy702::Simple. The Warriors need to keep losing in order to keep their draft pick.
PJ31::More to it than bad coaching????????  Something does not seem right!!!!!!!!!!
royboy1978::Bad coaching???
royboy1978::You gambling trolls can kiss my Beale Street Blue a.ss!!!!!  Stop betting on sports and getting mad when you lose!!!!!!!!!!
notabanana103::i win =]
maxboltz619::The grizzlies cost me some money, fucc!
SB4LlFE::The Warriors know how to send fans home happy.  Home games: keep it close, win or lose. Road games: let the home team take over in the 4th to win.
WarriorEngine::Any loss is a good loss. We believe 15 mores losses and close of season 0-20. LOL
jonty_1981::There last home game was against the nets and they were up double figures whole game but let nets run over them in 4th and home game before that they got flogged by hornets so your home game theory does not work
hepworth03::The warriors have always been good at losing.
thesheath2000::i'm leaving to throw up now.  watching golden state lose on purpose made me sick
TubbyTime334::Nice Comeback.
jonty_1981::I hope stern is watching these golden state games cause a blind person can see warriors are tanking there games. Draft system has to go.
Oaktown1029::Warriors are just not a very good team right now - Other "better teams" step it up during crunch time - that's what the Grizzlies did. The whole tanking talk is ridiculous.
notabanana103::its a lottery....
royboy1978::David Stern is a tool.  He should end this one and done rule so that Calipari won't use his shady acts to get recruits.
red_thief7::What do you propose they replace it with then?
soxfan123123::I am a sports writer go to www.meat spin.com i wrote about it
red_thief7::If you've at least thought it out then I won't rag on you for it.
soxfan123123::I wrote about it on www.Meat Spin.com  check it out
red_thief7::Make the rich get richer?
soxfan123123::The best teams get the so called "lottery" picks

Dominic10002::Good job GRIZZ!!! Let's get ready for Dallas
oneandonlybabe::Phew that was a close one but they HAD to back up the Thunder win (even if it was against a mediocre team) Grizz, don't look back, onwards and upwards!

All Refs Suck::Stupid Jackson.  Doesn't even give us a chance even if we make that 3.  Come on Coach!!!!!!
hepworth03::winning develops a culture of winning.  losing on purpose will never benefit a franchise in the long term. do you really think a Number 7 lottery pick is worth enough to overcome a culture of losing.  Oh yeah...you're a warriors fan... that's all you know.
SB4LlFE::you're dumb, this draft is deep with plenty of good prospects.
jonty_1981::It's called tanking. What is the benefit of winning. Nothing. Losing meanwhile equals higher draft pick
