xavierurpert345::Rudy gay a beast for the home town memphis grizzlies
yorklinks3::dwight is only staying with the magic cuz otis smith said if he didn't opt in they'd trade him to the lakers... lakers could of had cp3 and dwight... imagine that  http://bustasports.com/?p=1137
LP94PatsFan::Why is there no BareaSanity?
thel1195::No need.  He has a championship ring from Dallas.
jcmakesallthingsgood::I found a betting system a few months back called Sportsbettingstar. Since following this system I have made over $3,000  a month for 2 months straight now. I found this system on the 1st page of Google by searching the words "sports betting system". Thought I would post this for anyone that is not winning or struggling to win your sports bets
minnyzona91::my goodness, wesley johnson is a disgrace to the sg position.  he's posted more 0 point nights than he has double digit games
imsorry777::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKLAzyWiC4
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::MEOWWWWW
knight_rider_2002::Memphis is so freakin scary
eheinbigner::the wolves f.u.c.k.ing suck co.ck
yorklinks2::van gundy was talking about how dwight wants him fired, and dwight comes and gives him a hug.... most awkward thing ever haha  http://bustasports.com/?p=1137 SO happy t-wolves aren't this disfunctional
SouthMedTex::Lebron's team Sudden is stupid compared to kobe's intensity.   i.e. I suddenly lost control of my $@%! and pooed my self i.e. I wiped myself with intensity  see the difference?
imsorry777::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKLAzyWiC4
Dominic10002::Who agrees that the Bobcats should not be a team anymore?
mnsportswopbanthisespn::Wes Johnson you were the only one who played his heart out tonight.  I can't wait to see how your game elevates next season.  You keep playing like this and you will continue to become a BEAST
balltillifall_88::im a grizz fan, but what about barea? or was this sarcasm? lol
Tom D1946::while i agree that johnson sucks, berea is a very good back-up pg.  not much on defense, but has a nice all round game on the other end.  there are not many back-up pg's as good as he is.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::COMPLETE sarcasm. And Barea generally sucks, although lately he's been decent. He dribbles too much.
minny snowta::yea, he's on fire!
MissSTATEboy::GRIZZLIES BEAT THEM AGAIN!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA
balltillifall_88::the rudy gay head bobble after a clutch shot = priceless
MemphisSwag::JJ Barea has a Miss Universe for a girlfriend he still wins every night.
MemphisSwag::Its not kool to use Gay in basketball...LOL
SouthMedTex::Rudy can't play anymore! Rudy means stupid or dumb lol
MemphisSwag::Rudy Gay what a way to close it out.
SouthMedTex::Spurs owning Lakers. Can't even get a post off
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Haha they shuttin bynum down.
PadresChargersClippers::The women's basketball top 10 plays of all time are all layups and long 3pointers.
nuggetsRulz::Nope it's not, BUT I did conduct my own female sport draft last weekend. The presumed winner made me my sandwich in record time, but then I realized she didn't bring me my beer so I disqualified her.
nuggetsRulz::She had ALL the tools, indeed, but you can't coach natural ability.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Yeah, I guess you can't expect too much right out of college. Did she have a pro-level body?
nuggetsRulz::Well, thats more like player development. things that are to occur AFTER the draft.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Well officiated. Did she remember to fold the laundry too?
nuggetsRulz::Not in the sport of womens Greco-Roman nude wrestling! It's on cable.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Pay per view i suppose. How much?
PadresChargersClippers::Thats not real...is it?
broncosrocksnuggz::Was I the only one who got flagged for posting comments during the wnba draft yesterday lol?
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::LOL They had a board for that!? HAHAHAHAHA THAT'S CLASSIC
broncosrocksnuggz::Yeah the draft was going on live while i was at work
PadresChargersClippers::The f.uck is the WNBA draft?
broncosrocksnuggz::i put poop in my toilet&gt; wnba and I GOT FLAGGED
PadresChargersClippers::I like the nuggets but I really dont like the broncos. Maybe now that Jesus is out of town I wont mind them as much.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Is it even possible to like Tebow? I think not.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Very. Ponder showed a few times this season that he might be usable, but we need a complete overhaul for our O-line and secondary.
PadresChargersClippers::Assuming you're a vikings fan, it was frustrating to watch Ponder throw that last minute Interception when they played Denver.
SouthMedTex::According to LeBron's commercial-every 26 seconds a LeBron James player drops out of high school.
nuggetsRulz::In other news, there was an WNBA draft recently, apparently women are playing professional basketball. And here I thought it was just a series of LGBT meetings. wow.
nuggetsRulz::Although, it does help explain the bobcats, or pussycats as they are known internally.
royboy1978::Sexist fools.
PadresChargersClippers::Why does the WNBA/college still exist? Only girls sport that should be allowed is volleyball.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Should be TNBA- Tranny National Basketball Association
SouthMedTex::Its where the women who cant get a date go to live their lives with others like them
wiqdgato::i liked it too
PadresChargersClippers::I liked this.
SaintsNO9::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-qodBTlMtA  LOL #9 is like the Black woman that excessively repeats everything in Church
broncosrocksnuggz::http://youtu.be/jDoTvLXDR3c   My man CBREW GOING OFF
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::22 points. Anybody can have a 20 point game once a season. DARKO scored like 25 on the clips one time this year lol.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Yeah. Well Rambis was never know for being a great coach, his lineups had to be as bad or worse than GK's.
broncosrocksnuggz::off bench he brings raw energy and comes off guns a blazing
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::That explains a lot. Pretty sure the Wolves always started him. I'm not completely sure, I barely watched the wolves between 07-11
broncosrocksnuggz::he had 26 ALL IN THE 2ND HALF TOO
broncosrocksnuggz::off the bench .That fool sucks when he starts
balltillifall_88::he had a HUGE night against the grizz, wasnt he like 6/6 from 3 or something?
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::I know. I'm not saying he's as bad as Darko or anything. Was that 22 off the bench or starting?
broncosrocksnuggz::He had another against memphis and a 19 point night as well
PadresChargersClippers::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpeWrcQWzRA
broncosrocksnuggz::NUGGETS ARE GONNA WIN THE WEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SouthMedTex::Maybe they can beat everyone at skiing, but not basketball
balltillifall_88::haha. touche
gotigersmemphis87::I liked this until I realized who said it and had to unlike it
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6LPGrxlyNw
balltillifall_88::is johnson still on the team? i didnt even notice tonight. they have to laugh a little every time they shake hands now.
balltillifall_88::haha. at least you have kevin love though. he is a freakin beast.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Yep. There is no way for us to get rid of him.
balltillifall_88::i never knew it was that big lol
balltillifall_88::haha thats awesome
SouthMedTex::Why are Bynum's eyes always so wide
nuggetsRulz::drugs have a strange effect on the senses....OR he is looking for bling ideas.
PadresChargersClippers::I dont like Bynum's game.
SaintsNO9::He has a very nice mid range jumper and shoots around 70% from the line...
SouthMedTex::he doesnt have size, he has SIZE
balltillifall_88::first of all, isnt that what a center is supposed to do? second of all, he does have pretty good touch.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::True.
SouthMedTex::He uses his size to bully the defender. he has no touch
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::You're a Clippers fan.
balltillifall_88::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGFDF96hwTE&amp;feature=related  did any of you t'wolves fans see this live? god its hilarious.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::The worst thing I have ever seen. Bigger tragedy than 9/11.
balltillifall_88::lmfao
jjohnsob723::Wanna hear a joke?  The Timberwolves won a game.
balltillifall_88::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGFDF96hwTE&amp;feature=related  thats an even funnier t'wolves moment
nuggetsRulz::I got a better one. The Bobcats have won 7!!!
nuggetsRulz::haha, yes, MJ as an owner is polar opposite of MJ as a player. LOSE at all cost!!!!!
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Yeah. Wolves without Love, Rubio and Ridnour are almost as bad.
SaintsNO9::As bad as their record is, after watching them a few games I can't figure out how they've even won that many. The Hornets basically sat 6 of their 7 best players and still beat them in Charlotte by shooting just over 30% from the field.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::The second one was better.
balltillifall_88::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg   "f*ckin rudy gay!!". man, that never gets old.
SaintsNO9::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpZi4ke1Vz4&amp;feature=related   I like this one better. :)
balltillifall_88::lmao oh ok
SaintsNO9::ah ok i didnt watch your video. yeah that one is hilarious too!
balltillifall_88::thats the same audio from the video i posted... its not real...
SaintsNO9::He started going bonkers before Rudy even got touched.
SaintsNO9::No, I didn't like the injury u idiot. Just the fans reaction.
balltillifall_88::wow you are pretty pathetic. somebody that likes the saints glad that somebody had an injury? what a suprise... thats why you have no head coach this year.
SouthMedTex::Do you Minnesota f.ags wished the Lakers stayed?
SouthMedTex::but moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom!
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::You tell 'im Ma!
nuggetsRulz::no butts young man, I'm sick and tired of your petulance, and I don't want to hear your $@%!$@%! free speech crap!
nuggetsRulz::"if I have to tell ONE more time to settle down.........why I'm gonna.........."
nuggetsRulz::Go to your room, NOW!
SouthMedTex::Im gonna tell ma momma!!!!!
royboy1978::You're about to be flagged as well.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Maybe it did....
SouthMedTex::oh ha i thought it said licked it lol
royboy1978::I hope that everyone loves themselves.  If not, then that person has some serious issues.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::I liked it.
SouthMedTex::Does liking yourself make you feel special?
royboy1978::I don't need this site to feel big.  I won't, however, tolerate bull sh.it!!!!!!!!!!
SouthMedTex::Does it make you feel big to flag me?lol
Is that your baby question mark::good luck  it takes like 10 fans to flag and delete his comment
SouthMedTex::Minnesota Lakers&gt;Minnesota Wolves
mitlong::Minneapolis Lakers
SouthMedTex::Any in south Cali are man made
nuggetsRulz::I wonder if California has more than 10,000 lakes.
SaintsNO9::Empty toilet paper roll &gt; Minnesota sports franchises
Bhens87::NO contributes nothing other then having to rebuild that dump after hurricanes.  Minn has some $@%! teams right now but it's a much better place to live.
nuggetsRulz::wow, a trolling saint fan? haha
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Target, Best Buy, the Mayo Clinic, some of the best schools in the nation. YOU'RE WELCOME.
nuggetsRulz::It IS a major port and throughput, lots of natural resources. Perhaps it should be an outpost or something where a brave few deal with life under sea level for the betterment of us all.
SaintsNO9::It's just a major port city for the country. You are right. That's not important at all. What the hell does Minnesota contribute to the USA besides butt hurt sports fans and $@%!$@ weather.?
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::LOL they should have let it stay flooded. Nothing important there anyway. Gotta give you the dome one though :)
SaintsNO9::True.
SaintsNO9::LOL it would've been fine if the Army Corp of Engineers would've done their job right.
SouthMedTex::Stupid enough to let snow collapse your roofs
nuggetsRulz::this is a very good point.
nuggetsRulz::cant argue that, although the twins seem to be at least competitive some of the time.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::At least we're not stupid enough to build below sea level.
SaintsNO9::It's not trolling if it's true. Minnesota has terrible professional teams.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::FUCK YOU AND YOUR CHEATING SAINTS I HOPE NOLA STAYS FLOODED NEXT TIME
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Haha please, if we could take you guys into OT with 6 TO's and playing generally like crap all around we would have EASILY destroyed the colts.
Bhens87::haha you know that ain't true.  Now go to back to the South's version of Detroit.
SaintsNO9::He got hit High Low one time bro. Maybe if u guys didn't turn the ball over 6 times and come out with 12 in the huddle after a timeout u would've earned the shot to be blown out by the Colts in the Super Bowl that year.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Bullshit! Favre was getting hit high-low all game. Stupid NFL felt sorry for all the people in NOLA still bitching about Katrina FIVE YEARS AFTER and gave them the game. Fuck you.
SaintsNO9::It wasn't cheating bro. There were no flags... All legal hits.
jjohnsob723::Grizz &gt; Spurs &gt; Timberwolves  Fact.
SouthMedTex::lol Memphis public schools
balltillifall_88::SouthMedTex tries to overcompensate... dont worry about him...
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::I'm a Wolves fan you $@%!. We split the season series, right?
SouthMedTex::^Lol Memphis public schools
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Didn't we split the series?
jjohnsob723::Actually, I stand corrected.  The Timberwolves own the Spurs.
balltillifall_88::the spurs championship window closing is nothing to be upset about... its been a good run. its just time for a shift of power in the west :)
SouthMedTex::Spurs/Lakers board is going to be overrun by nasty LA fans. So this is now official Spurs board
nuggetsRulz::I get it, and totally understand.
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::I'm cool with that.
balltillifall_88::you arent much better
