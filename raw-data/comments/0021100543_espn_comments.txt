ECUmaniac252::George Hill being back is huge, we would have never went on that losing streak had he not got hurt.  PACERS BEAT THE BULLS!!
Taco with a Q::every reason for optimism
mlmay31::We shall see Monday. Really surprised how confident Pacers team and fans are these days. I'm always worried about over-confidence but I feel it only helps this Pacer team usually. Still not ready yet but they are getting close.
CandySparker::Cheers, JJs in NBA!

raylangivensisjustified::You can thank the commish for not allowing the trade with the Lakers to go through.......and leaving this abomination of a Hornets team.Whatta disgusting show the Hornets put on at home.
somaliangangsterpuff::Peyton Manning will always be a horse not the colt.
JeremyGoogLIN::Who each team should draft - http://hoopsgrind.com/2012/02/25/blogging-through-ncaa-saturday-2-25-12/
bigjon7501::So much football conversation in a basketball area.... meh ohh well The Pacers win!!! This is a good team! Don't sleep on them!
ColtsnIrish027::Nawlins fans are expressing their inferiority complex by mentioning a SB from 3 years ago. Pacer fans don't care about anything but the health of the greatest QB of all time.
somaliangangsterpuff::Yeah I hope Joe Montana is OK man!
NOLA Sports::JOE MONTANA&gt; WHO EVER THE HELL CAME FROM A NEW ORLEANS COLLEGE
ColtsnIrish027::Touche
ColtsnIrish027::Joe Montana has the most Super Bowls to go along with Terry Bradshaw, but neither are the GOAT. That title belongs to a NOLA kid.....
ColtsnIrish027::Archie Manning.....
indy500fans::Who is the NOLA kid you are referring to?  Bobby Hebert?
NOLA Sports::OH I SEE WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM PEYTON MANNING TAKING A TERRIBLE TEAM TO GREATNESS SINCE 98 RIGHT!?
ColtsnIrish027::GOAT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Joe Montana
NOLA Sports::TRICK STATEMENT JOE MONTANA IS THE GOAT
TheJTram::I swear the Pacers don't get enough recognition
ColtsnIrish027::If it's not Kobe or Lebron, nobody cares.....
PadresChargersClippers::Because they can't compete with teams better than the knicks.
indy500fans::Who hasn't the Heat humiliated this season?  They will do that until the playoffs when Lebron forgets to show up in the 4th quarter.
irishindy123::a lot of teams are getting "raped" by miami
PadresChargersClippers::I think the pacers are good and deserve a little more recognition, but after they got raped by Miami, it's hard to take them too seriously, not hating, just saying why the media isn't all over them.
indy500fans::What? They are the only team to beat the Lakers, Celts, Mavs, Magic, and the Bulls ON THE ROAD this season.  No one else has that quality of wins this season.
irishindy123::well they beat the bulls and lakers this year sooo...
indy500fans::The national media equates the Pacers to one thing...MALICE in the PALACE.
indy500fans::Amundson has his first double-double tonight.  AWESOME, LOUIS!!!! This team will continue to gel, and may get a 2 or a 3 seed for the playoffs.  Once West gets totally healthy, Pacers will be DANGEROUS!
ColtsnIrish027::The Pacers are certainly a more complete team than the Colts. It's nice to watch a successful team that doesn't rely on one player.
adavisrc09::Really?
TheJTram::One day, they can finally ring for Reggie Miller :)

whodat4409::who would want to live in the boring, cold midwest?  Indiana...really????  fat, corn-fed ugly people...
P_MurderClick::Well I remember a bunch of people from New Orleans coming up to Indy to live about 6 years ago.    I didnt hear you $@%!$@% complaining while your house was floating away
Taco with a Q::New Orleans is NO Orleans
indy500fans::Whodat...I have been to New Orleans...Not too many skinny women down there.  Just sayin'.
ColtsnIrish027::"Indianapolis is like New Orleans, but without the dirty" -Boomer Esiason Super Bowl 46
indy500fans::Awesome economy, 4 true seasons, ALL KINDS of pro and amateur sporting teams.  No Hurricanes.  Very cheap to live here.
NGplayinskillz::Apparently a Lot of people. Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois have a lot of residents.
thethithua::why the fk the players are so stubborn
ColtsnIrish027::What is there not to understand? You're a degenerate gambler that worries about the spread and over/under. We're just fans that just want our teams to win.
thethithua::not much but i still dun understand
ColtsnIrish027::how much money did you lose, degenerate gambler?
bmick15::hope ronaldos still online...  ff  aa g
thethithua::wow 2s left the basket rigged the over

P_MurderClick::Indy has several cornfields.    But we dont have hurricanes.....
Taco with a Q::Indy has no cornfields...FACT
indy500fans::I am surprised you can spell Indiana.
PacerFan19a::Someone is sad their team isnt as good as ours.
NOLA Sports::LOLOLOL SUPER BOWL 44*
thethithua::how can this game went OVER 184 fk rigged
NOLA Sports::AINT FANS THINK BREES CARES ABOUT THAT PUTRID CITY, IN FACT,  HE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT
thethithua::wow IND still trying to score wtf wrong with that pass
PacerFan19a::WTF was that Lou?
thethithua::gonna be a Freethrows parade for a 30 points blow out game
todogg16::KOBE IS MOST OVERRATED PLAYER IN NBA BY FAR http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
NOLA Sports::DREW BREES WILL LEAVE THE SAINTS AFTER THIS SEASON HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT NEW ORLEANS
ColtsnIrish027::Forget Brees.......You guys should bring home the greatest QB of all time.
thethithua::i say over 187
ColtsnIrish027::awwwe, you lose degenerate gambler....
ColtsnIrish027::degenerate gambler

NOLA Sports::DREW BREES IS GREEDY... DOESN'T DESERVE THE TITLE OF BREESUS
NOLA Sports::Super Bowl 2009 *
ColtsnIrish027::If NOLA could beat Rex Grossman, Brees would have two Super Bowls.
NOLA Sports::THE SAINTS NEVER BEAT INDY IN THE SB
thethithua::the Ref won it for them.... cuz they feel sorry for the city
MilitaryIndustrialComplex::yeah that whole SB was annoying, everyone was like we feel bad for them bc of a natural disaster so they deserve to win, umm what does that have to do with a football game, take your pity elsewhere, try not living below sea level if you don't want to deal with water, goes the same for those who live in tornado valley, MOVE if you don't want to deal with the consequences, but don't think you deserve wins in a sport bc of it, no relation
PacerFan19a::Time to look forward to Chicago... Good game New Orleans fans good luck in the future.
thethithua::anyone comment on John Wall missed free throw earlier... -4 spread and they win by 3... Cle took the last shot and intentionally let the clock ran out so they can cover the spread...
ColtsnIrish027::epitome of a degenerate gambler.....
thethithua::i will ran off 23s off and shoot and disregard the result
nblucas97::Ummm....what?
ColtsnIrish027::The pacers are classless for running up the score!!!
thethithua::Hornets are sorry enough so give them mercy
adavisrc09::they better get it while they can
thethithua::i dont like Hill dunk before the 6m mark
thethithua::he should dribbled out the 3 points area and wait for his team mates
ColtsnIrish027::He should've purposely dribbled it off his foot.
thethithua::i never see a 30 game blow out and the players are still wanna score
thethithua::vegas just call in for a OVER... look at the players rushing up and down the court
ColtsnIrish027::There might be more fans in Nawlins in the arena than if the game was played at Conseco (banker's life FH)
indy500fans::That is because the fans came to see NOLA resident Danny Granger put it to the home team.
ColtsnIrish027::I don't.
NGplayinskillz::Meh. I doubt it.
BernardPollardFanClub::Its llke a hurricane came in and destroyed new orleans                    Too soon?
