Kobe haters are bums with keyboards247::^^^
grettings444::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKLAzyWiC4
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Warriors do nothing but shoot long jumpers, really hard to understand the free throw gap?
Chickism::They also are last in the league at shooting threes.  Coincidence, or a result of how basketball works?
BayAreaZ::True, but every single game regardless of their opponent the Lakers seem to take 15-35 more FTs...  Wonder what their record would be like without the refs desperately trying to help them every game..?  We'll never know, but you can bet they'd have a lot less banners...
Stryker Rip Strongheart::"LA seems to be the only team in NBA history that needs 25 4th Quarter FTs for their banners..."  -couldn't agree with this more
SoCrazyIJusMightWork::2008 Finals game 2 38 -10 ft discrepency in Favor of Boston, changed the series
SoCrazyIJusMightWork::We were favored going into the series by all the analyst.. after what happened in game 2 &amp; 4, a let down like that isnt far fetched
BayAreaZ::Nice try, but everyone knew Boston was the better team after crushing LA by 39 points in Game 6...
rex_coach::Great to be a part of HISTORY!  That should really make you MAD... lmfao
UseLogic813::B77MC - Once again great job Lakers. You don't need Kobe when the refs give you 28 free throws to Golden States 10. To have that kind of advantage and not be playing at home, rigged. ###########################################################################  B4 u talk s.hit, how about u use ur head. The Lakers have two 7 footers compared to the Warriors 0! The Lakers pound the ball inside, while the warriors settle for jumpshots. Please think b4 u type next time.
jlane0049::Lakers suck
Chip_Douglas_69::KOBEEEEEEE
B77MC::Once again great job Lakers. You don't need Kobe when the refs give you 28 free throws to Golden States 10. To have that kind of advantage and not be playing at home, rigged.
Stryker Rip Strongheart::It's been this way for the Lakers since the 2002 WCF, unfortunately, although I think we can give them a pass here - the Lakers are clearly better than the Warriors.
SoCrazyIJusMightWork::Cant we just be better than them?
bad_finger68::"Don't feed the trolls anymore and they will go back to work"  Umm, thats assuming they have jobs in the first place. Hard for poor souls with IQ's under 100 to find steady employment....
jlane0049::the only trolls are laker fans who hide under the bridge until they win one, and then they scurry like $@%! roaches to tell everyone how wonderful their team is until they lose.,then back under the bridge
Bynum Pulls Down 30::seems they went on lunch, or forgot to pay the electric bill, or group gay sex.
Brett0346::You got a rapist, fan fighter, and team virus all playing on the same team.  Wonderful.
bad_finger68::One of the best things about being a Laker fan is watching haters writhe in envious agony.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Is that how you talk about your family? for shame
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Please name one rape victim who goes out after being "attacked" and has sex immediately after. - case closed
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Don't feed the trolls anymore and they will go back to work.
Brett0346::to be honest, let's remove the rape equation and just say he's trash for cheating on his former wife.  Don't get married if you want to bang away after every game.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::So every single pro athlete is trash..got it
Brett0346::I'm glad a rape doesn't matter to you depending upon what happens afterwards.  so is there a list of things that the person who got raped can't do afterwards or else they automatically did not get raped?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::If the list includes bragging to her friends about having sex with Kobe while banging the local college football team.. yeah
skcusebok::just speaking the truth
Bynum Pulls Down 30::speaking?
Pablo..Miguel::POP QUIZ : Who's the only active player that has bricked over 12,000 shots?  HINT : He commited a horrible crime in Eagle Colorado
kobesmask::pablomiguel
BayAreaZ::You can tell the other Lakers are dreading Rape Boy's return...  They've been winning, having fun, playing good team ball...
Chickism::They also got blown out twice when their offense was not clicking.  Kobe used to have moments that he was an impediment to good team play, but he got over that long ago.   He still can be an impediment when the team is ahead though.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::YOu must be a lakers fan, you follow every game. Even know how the players are feeling?  WOW
AlaskaHawks::2 worst losses of the year
sokal-surf::Well, I'm sure Kobe is all broken up about the minimum wagers and never-have-beens bashing his "legacy".   I just hope the loser can console himself behind the walls of his Newport Beach mansion, those multi-millions of dollars he's made from a career spanning 15 years and corporate endorsements, those 5 rings he apparently leeched along with 2 Finals MVP awards, and the knowledge that no matter what the second-rate citizens on some blog say about him, they will never obtain any status that even remotely resembles success...  Way to live the dream, guys...
kempstylez40::Is it easier to commit rape behind those walls?
sokal-surf::Why, are you looking a good time?  I doubt they'd even "allow" you to cruise down his street...
Bynum Pulls Down 30::BayArea's team has no past or future, he hates the Lakers and their fans to fill his life with joy, sad
skcusebok::kobes overrated
Pablo..Miguel::THINGS KOBE IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO   1. Pass the ball 2. Be a teammate 3. Order room service
Stryker Rip Strongheart::Can't play a playoff series without getting 20 free throws a game from the refs
skcusebok::cant play on a team without 7 footers
BayAreaZ::or make half his shots in a game...
ACandOJ::Pop quiz: How many times since 1994 have the Warriors been over .500??
ACandOJ::Sorry guys...the answer is 2.  2 lousy times in almost 20 years.  I would talk about the Lakers if I was him too
BayAreaZ::Makes sense that a big rapist fan would have OJ's Bronco as their pic...
Bynum Pulls Down 30::You live in the sodomy capital of the world... ironic  lol
BayAreaZ::W's upset of Dallas in '07 tops anything the Lakers have done in decades...  Unless we're counting tainted titles...
kempstylez40::45
kempstylez40::u bro mad?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::someone failed math classes in 1st grade
AlaskaHawks::3?
Pablo..Miguel::A lot of people forget that Kobe should be in prison right now
Brett0346::aka hush money was paid out, probably from the league!
BayAreaZ::Typical 'class' of a Laker fan...slamming a rape victim...
Bynum Pulls Down 30::zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Bynum Pulls Down 30::alleged, the case was dropped. aka she lied
BayAreaZ::I'm sure the Faber family and their community haven't forgotten.  Too bad none of them owned a working shotgun...
Bynum Pulls Down 30::You mean the football team she is banging right now?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Your mom reminds you every night.
kempstylez40::Mom joke.  We have a winner.
BayAreaZ::Who's more efficient, Kobeyashi at eating hot dogs or Kobe Bryant at missing shots..?
mrwalker13::YEA SHOOTING A CAREER 46% IS MISSING A LOT OF SHOTS!! LETS SEE YOU DO THAT
BayAreaZ::When does everyone think the Lakers last won a title legitimately..?   I'm going with '88...
BayAreaZ::It seems the truth has irked you...or, in the words of your best friend...  u mad bro'..?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Since you wont cop to your team. I'm thinking you are ashamed.
Tontos Redemption::His team is the Eastern Conference, OKC, and San Antonio
Bynum Pulls Down 30::When has your team ever won one?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Every one of them was legit.
BayAreaZ::Since you didn't answer, we'll put you down for '87...
kempstylez40::'52
Tontos Redemption::LAL : @SA, OKC, @SAC  LAC: @PHO, NO, @ATL, @NYK  LAL own the head to head tiebreaker. Do the Clippers take the Division?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Clippers have never won it so my money is on LAL
skcusebok::if kobe plays yes
Tontos Redemption::Ha...I think the Clippers drop 1 of the last 2 (if those games matter to the Hawks and Knicks)  Lakers cant lose to both SA and OKC
kempstylez40::"The Suns are better than I could ever be" - Kobe
ACandOJ::A team better than one guy....never!!
Bynum Pulls Down 30::huh?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Professional trolls BayArea and Kempstylez should get together and have kids.
skcusebok::you should of CAME to my party last night.Your mom did twice.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::And you call Kobe a rapist?
skcusebok::I have a head pain from your mom screaming last night!
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Looks like their kid has down syndrome, such a shame.
skcusebok::u mad bro?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Looks like they just did
BayAreaZ::The real question about Kobe at this point in his career...  Would he be the best player in the WNBA..?
skcusebok::his shooting % would drop a little more tho
Yungdubz27::"BayAreaZ - The W's upset of Dallas in 2007 was bigger than anything LA has accomplished since '88.."   lmmfao....
ACandOJ::A lot of people every where think the Warriors haven't won a title since 1975 &amp; have only been over .500 2 times since 1994
BayAreaZ::A lot of fans outside of LA think the Lakers haven't won a legit title since '88...  '02 and '10 were fairly obvious fixes, and you have to wonder then about the other titles...  LA seems to be the only team in NBA history that needs 25 4th Quarter FTs for their banners...
BayAreaZ::Jordan said that Kobe was about the fifth-best SG ever...  Most charitable comment ever made in sports history..?
ACandOJ::MJ also said Kobe was the only player to compare to him....
skcusebok::Kobe quit in the playoffs
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Didn't he also say Kwame Brown was the #1 pick?
Tontos Redemption::Jordan also thought Kwame Brown was a good pick. I wouldnt put too much credence into what he thinks.
kempstylez40::Jordan had just finished 3 bottles of Grey Goose when he said that.
Pablo..Miguel::Yup I know it hurts you.....top 10 to ever play the game -______________________  Top 10 players dont get benched in the 4th quarter of a close game
BayAreaZ::The W's upset of Dallas in 2007 was bigger than anything LA has accomplished since '88...
BayAreaZ::how can you not be a fervent fan of a bricklaying rapist..??  how dare you!!!
Yungdubz27::What is there to cheer about if you're a Warriors fan.
tgtg31::Uhhhhh again if you think he raped anyone you are an absolute idiot and the guy will be the 3rd all time leading scorer taking 3 less shots per game than Jordan did
Bynum Pulls Down 30::How can you spend more time hating Kobe then cheering for your own team
tgtg31::What?  You are the biggest idiot I have seen in 6 years on ESPN......delete your account now, please, for the good of man-kind
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Dwight Howard - refuses to play anymore for Van Gundy.  Once again the trade that wasn't made is one of the best moves in Lakers history.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Dwight Howard is a head case and has a potentially career ending injury. Glad they didn't trade for him...should of been obvious, even to a trolling genius
BayAreaZ::Unless the Lakers were planning on hiring Van Gundy not sure what your point is...
BayAreaZ::Would have been interesting to see Kobe's career if he'd actually played for Charlotte...  Probably a career average of about 14 points, no all-star games, maybe two or three playoff appearances...
skcusebok::good point kobe would of been antoher AI
Yungdubz27::Kobe haters singing their shoulda coulda woulda's over here.
tgtg31::Guy would've averaged 40 in the East
tgtg31::It's crazy how a washed-up, joke, rapist is the hottest topic of conversation on any pro basketball board.  Oh yeah that's right, it's because he's one of the badest to ever pick up a ball.  In 2 more years Bryant will be top 3 in scoring, top 15 in assists, top 90 in rebounding with 5 or more rings.......guy is definitely trash.
BayAreaZ::Best rapist in the league...
tgtg31::^^^^My point exactly
tgtg31::Yup I know it hurts you.....top 10 to ever play the game
kempstylez40::Who is?
BayAreaZ::if by 'badest' you mean poorest shooters, you have a point...
Pablo..Miguel::he's not trash, he's garbage
kempstylez40::83 career assists puts you in the top 15?
Pablo..Miguel::"Kobe is a joke" - Bozo the Clown
Pablo..Miguel::BayAreaZI think it's cool the Lakers are building a statue of Kobe outside of Staples...    They supposedly have gathered almost enough bricks to get started......more ______   It should be a statue of Kobe being carried by Shaq and Gasol
Bynum Pulls Down 30::And Jordan's statue being carried by Pippen, Grant/Rodman?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::It's as absurd as saying Shaq/Gasol carried Kobe.
WatEvasCleva24::And Pierce statue being carry out on a wheelchair
BayAreaZ::yeah, those guys carried Jordan...  guess you never saw those teams play...
kempstylez40::I think we can all agree that Kobe is a huge joke.
Pablo..Miguel::Agree
tgtg31::Who's your favorite player?
WatEvasCleva24::I think this guy is a Knick fan
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Shawn Kemp - I hope not.
kempstylez40::Kobe
AlaskaHawks::Bigger DNA receptacle, fabers panties or Pablo's mouth?
BayAreaZ::It has to be your dad's $@%!...
Pablo..Miguel::"Kobe's innocent" - OJ Simpson
Bynum Pulls Down 30::NO pico di galo on my taco hombre.
WatEvasCleva24::come up with new jokes...I heard this one too many times
BayAreaZ::I think it's cool the Lakers are building a statue of Kobe outside of Staples...  They supposedly have gathered almost enough bricks to get started...
skcusebok::good one
Bynum Pulls Down 30::so original, and intellectually superior.
WatEvasCleva24::Lebron is an all time great Choker he should get an MVP for that
Yungdubz27::Are the Warriors still hanging that "We beat Dallas in the 1st round" banner from the rafters?
kempstylez40::I'm glad kobesmask used a "your mom" joke.  I went the whole morning without a Lakers fan making one.
kobesmask::thats how i roll
kempstylez40::I appreciate your rolls.
Pablo..Miguel::Top Lakers Clown Comebacks  1. Ur Mom 2. He didnt rape her
Yungdubz27::Top Kobe haters comments  1. Kobe is a rapist 2. He isn't better then Jordan
BayAreaZ::Kobe didn't rape her, he just really really enjoys hiring large legal defense teams, admitting to wrongdoing, and buying his wife a $5 million ring...
tgtg31::BayAreaZ is such an idiot it's scary
AceVenturaMavsCoach::you forgot 3. u mad?
kobesmask::u mad bro
tgtg31::You really think Kobe Bryant raped that girl?
tgtg31::You are are an absolute idiot.....you need to delete your account now.
WatEvasCleva24::naaa that B.itch was a prostitute she just did that for Kobes money
AceVenturaMavsCoach::and yes kobe did,
kempstylez40::Kobe is an all-time great brick shooter.
BayAreaZ::Winning the scoring title while shooting poorly just shows what a selfish jerk Kobe is...
smoothcriminalXD::with soon to be 3 scoring titles and the most 3pts made in a game??? ithink not sir
kobesmask::lebrons fault
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Only thing Kobe has raped are the defenders on your favorite teams.
skcusebok::50 year old jason kidd last year.....
BayAreaZ::The refs hold 'em down, Kobe rapes 'em...
skcusebok::Tashaun Prince.............lol
skcusebok::do you have kobes nuts welded to your chin permanently
skcusebok::not a pistons fan and not a kobe nut hugger
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Your a Pistons fan? WOW explains alot. How can you afford internet with the 60% unemployment in Michigan?
Pablo..Miguel::&lt;----------- Is mad bro
BayAreaZ::Kobe is easily one of the top 500 players ever...  Okay, maybe not easily...
kobesmask::u mad bro?
kobesmask::Congrats, first step is admitting it.. Now just admit Kobe is an alltime great and wed be making real progress.
AceVenturaMavsCoach::but that would be a lie
kempstylez40::What is a u mad bro and where can Kobe find one to rape?
BayAreaZ::where kobesmask deals crack and gives free BJs...
kobesmask::u mad bro?
kobesmask::its your moms street name, and you could find her on the corner of sunset and vine
Pablo..Miguel::Im mad bro
Bynum Pulls Down 30::So glad i can use chrome to block pictures of gays on this board.
smoothcriminalXD::i can tell...first step is admitting it
kobesmask::o okay
AceVenturaMavsCoach::u mad bro? is probaby the most annoying overrused phrase
AceVenturaMavsCoach::percisely my point
smoothcriminalXD::u mad bro?
kobesmask::u mad bro?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::I love it, Lakers haters are more devoted then the fans. Keep worshiping, it only makes the Lakers stronger
skcusebok::4-0 sweep
Pablo..Miguel::Haters make Lakers stronger?? LMFAO....Lakers Clowns are funny
BayAreaZ::What a joke! Yes, I bet the Lakers are reading my post right now and vowing to play even harder!
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Pablo and Miguel .. are those the names on the 2 or more Social Security cards you use?
kempstylez40::That's sound logic.
Pablo..Miguel::Kobe without Shaq or Gasol : Missing the playoffs and getting knocked out in the 1st round  Yeah, Kobe is an all time great
Yungdubz27::Lol...Gasol without Kobe? 0 playoffs wins.....Shaq before Kobe? Swept in the NBA Finals
Yungdubz27::Malone got hurt in the WCF, Gary Payton was getting torched by Billups.
skcusebok::jackson,shaq,malone,payton...........lose?
BayAreaZ::Kobe barely makes the Lakers' all-time Top 10...
tgtg31::Hehe
WatEvasCleva24::now this is a real Kobe nuthugger  he just cant get Kobes name out of his mouth
skcusebok::if you think hes top 10 your an idiot
skcusebok::refer to aces list
tgtg31::Please name 9 basketball players better than Kobe Bryant
kobesmask::u mad bro?
tgtg31::Top 10 unless you're an idiot
biggerandbetterthanyou::chucky slurpers hated the lakers win last night they prefer to lose while their guy is faking injury
