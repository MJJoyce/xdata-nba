lll__::Burks played? The world HAS ended..
Darkflame07::Burks is getting his shot. It was going to happen at some point this season and he did what he was supposed to and stayed ready. It's just been hard to get him in the floor because foye is hitting threes and Gordon right now is just a better overall player, but I am glad that he got to play and he performed very well.
TheCronoMasterMind::I didn't get to see this game sadly, but I wish I could see a stat that says Orlando doesn't shoot less FTs than their competition every night. They tend to make more shots than their opponents but lose plenty of games this season from the stripe. Sometimes there are blatant missed calls that hurt us down the road, like against the Raptors, and sometimes when we get to the line, our guys miss. Either way, it's annoying to lose when your team outplays the other in every stat. Oh well, to the next game.
nba is the worst::Game of runs - but the Magic won't win many games when Redick and Nelson combine for 11 turnovers...
phunky58::gr8 to see andrew get his mins taken from him cuz of 1 off game, are u kidding me jacque.  im glad ur boy ayon choked. u got the wrong people on the court.  get it together already.
scow79::It could be worse.  Jazz fans would gladly trade Corbin for Vaughn.
team Reubes::Do you even watch the games he gets beat on defense all the time.
clippersck::So glad to see Mo thriving in his new home in Utah
Serg Abaka::He didn't play lol

Serg Abaka::trade for whatever big is playing against Jefferson and you are set
JPHoks1981::Where is the guy who said earlier their better when Hayward isnt on the court?
xenosapien::Thurl Bailey: If you don't score 100 points, you gotta keep the other team from doing that.  Well done.  Almost as Madden as "The team that scores the most points usually wins."
Serg Abaka::How come Burks played, is Carroll injured?
Darkflame07::That's what practice is for. Millsap didn't suddenly develop a jump shot during the season. He worked on it in the offseason.
randomstranger12::Hard to work on it when he never gets playing time.
Darkflame07::Carrol is much better defender. Burks played because of the terrible start to the game, an he played well. Still really needs to work on that jump shot though.
