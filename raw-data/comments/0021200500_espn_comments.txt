Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Ok CB.. I'll have your back...
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::True Duro... but seriously in today's society it's sad that the ones paying the price are the ones least looking for trouble :(
cbbaseball19::Harsh man.  I thought we were a 3 man wolfpack.....
Djuki 3::i'm a very peaceful being though, i don't see myself in dangerous situations
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::thank you for having my back correcting my grammar skills but I'm afraid this won't do for me to have your back in case you run into a situation like Duro's.
Djuki 3::haha much appreciated!
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::you know it man.
RunTheBall22._::motivation comes from the coach and leader of your team.  we all know Spo is not a great coach and Lebron is not a great leader. i guess this is why  i always hear the heat just don't try or were not interested. this is something that was not a problem with Phil MJ / Phil Kobe. just another reason it is to soon to start comparing Lebron to these guys
cbbaseball19::Guess there wasnt enough motivation last year..................... oh wait
RunTheBall22._::im sorry I'll try to dumb  things down for you next time. my bad
cbbaseball19::No its not, try to keep up
RunTheBall22._::it's pretty obvious, try to keep up
cbbaseball19::You didnt specify.  You try and keep up!
RunTheBall22._::talking about this year try to keep up

Djuki 3::he's no good, i'd rather they sign Madeeq Hertz
Aint Bout Dis Life::you should get that looked at
cbbaseball19::Welcome back to fifth grade
cbbaseball19::Keep on keepin on then!
Aint Bout Dis Life::i find being immature is the best way to pass time.
01Bulls4life::Alright, I'm outta here.  C-ya later.
cbbaseball19::man of few words.........
Djuki 3::later bro
Aicyla22::bye
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I just saw it, sorry my apologies. :)
Djuki 3::i think you should send him a kiss
Aicyla22::i said hi just below geez
Djuki 3::yeah what's up with that Alycia?  He professes his love for you and not even a greeting?
Aicyla22::lies! i told you hi and bye

Knicks Fan Since the other Week::why all the hate.. come on CB...
GaspoMinnyFan981::The heat need to call up Dexter Pittman
