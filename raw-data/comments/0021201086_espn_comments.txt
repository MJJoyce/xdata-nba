Valdosta Georgia TITLETOWN USA::Orlando is a poor excuse for a city. Without Disney, it has about as many amenities as Valdosta....no way can it compare to metro Atlanta which is 3x the size
workforfood666::yea but the state of Florida have many decent sized cities like Orlando.  You have Miami,  Jacksonville, etc, etc.  In Georgia all you really got is Atlanta, the one and only true city that shows out.  So everybody flock to that city.  Sure Georgia also got other cities like Macon and Savannah, but those cities are too small to be considered anything like Miami, Atlanta, Orlando, etc, etc
Bucks_fan_for_real.....::Magic blow
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::HAWKS OWN THE TRAGIC, NOT SAYING MUCH BUT IT IS A FACT OF LIFE RIGHT NOW.
ESmodPN::LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!!
workforfood666::Luckily this is only in NBA 2k
workforfood666::They fixed the typo like nothing ever happened
lebronjames646::there is a typo on the headlines for this game
FEAR_THE_HEAT::Headline fail
atl_hawks_8::Great job, ESPN. The new TMZ of sports.
riffralph16::Who do the hawks have for their future, josh smith is likely to leave and their only left with horford lol
riffralph16::My point is the magic have a better future dont  get butt hurt
austuc33::magic future is clevand present
DeviouStaal_::lololololol
workforfood666::they still got Lou Williams and a lot of money to sign a top player
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::As if the world revolves around Josh Smith, ever heard of free agency? lol  at yourself
UGatorsF2347::Horford
lebronjames646::teague? free agency? are you new to basketball?
No One Likes Xui Li::Magic record 10th straight win over Hawks....ESPN is garbage
TheDynastyBball::Yeah...they all keeping track of every time LeBron farts so they can smell it..that's why they make these mistakes about who actually won - Magic or Hawks.  Stern has put LeBron into their heads.
tommyb2k12::Lmao. I caught that, too.
riffralph16::At the end of the day the hawks wont win the championship and they probably wont for a while
lebronjames646::someones $@%!$@%!
Clint25548::Clint25548 - Atleast the hawks can make the playoffs, no hope for the magic. I feel bad for the magic bc their fans suck...
Lilb1190::I live in Atlanta and I can confirm that our fans suck. They only show up to cheer for the other team or during the playoffs.
tommyb2k12::Nobody likes Atlanta... Whens the last time they had a superstar? Dominique?
atl_hawks_8::I like Atlanta.
Clint25548::Clint25548 - Atleast the hawks can make the playoffs, no hope for the magic. I feel bad for the magic bc their fans suck...
Clint25548::Clint25548 - Atleast the hawks can make the playoffs, no hope for the magic. I feel bad for the magic bc their fans suck...
Clint25548::Atleast the hawks can make the playoffs, no hope for the magic. I feel bad for the magic bc their fans suck...
Queue10::for some reason, ESPN gives this game the title: Magic record 10th straight win over Hawks.... Interesting
devabarry::April Fool's!
tommyb2k12::WE'VE BEEN TROLLED.
deoro19::Typical ,,,
ajhustad::Yeah, great job by the writers tonight!!
MagicBoltzRays::hopefully Charlotte wins tonight.
randybulls24::I think Orlando will get the 1st draft pick this year!
cflip37::Why take nicholson back out
Clint25548::Magic fans are trolls, always talking about future when there team sucks now, smh. No hope for the magic past, present or future
tommyb2k12::Worst position is 8-5 seed; reason being the draft will suck for them (usually) and a first round exit, unless luck prevails, second round exit.
chris johnson 558::are the Hawks good now idiot ? you will have a first round exit and no future for you
Clint25548::you mad magic fans? Horrible fans and hey atleast the hawks can make it to the playoffs :)
MagicBoltzRays::coming from a hawks fan. hilarious.
kevin durant is a poor mans melo::lol
4SportsFanESPN::Did korver hit a 3?
MagicBoltzRays::nobody answer.
4SportsFanESPN::Did korver hit a 3 today?
Alex4ATL::NO.
hawk4life2121232::5-18... 7-21 lol..  That's the future?
MagicBoltzRays::Udrih is not part of our future. he's a 30 year old back up PG. Harkless/Harris/Vucevic.
tommyb2k12::And a top 5 pick... sounds better than atlanta!
MagicBoltzRays::better than any future the hawks have.
Clint25548::says the magic fan, look at yalls record... anything is better than the magic
chris johnson 558::those refs are one of the worst refs i have ever seen
hawk4life2121232::magic just suck..
tommyb2k12::chris johnson 558 - and the hawks will win the the championship ? lol does anyone even care about your team the attendance ranking magiic 15 hawks 26 so shut up   LMAO! Magic second worst team record wise but still 15th in attendance!  Damn the Hawks suck. I heard the other year, they DIDNT sellout a playoff game, how pathetic.
Clint25548::yeah the magic suck bad
chris johnson 558::and the hawks will win the the championship ? lol does anyone even care about your team the attendance ranking magiic 15 hawks 26 so shut up
Bobcats Will Dominate Soon::It's funny. The Magic's future is in 3 players they traded for that all road the bench and never got any playing time...
UGatorsF2347::Yeah, cuz Vucevic's averaging of a double-double at age 22 doesn't show he's someone to build around. Also, Harkless is 19 years old. Getting solid playing time on any team in the NBA at that age shows you got something going for you. Btw, ROAD the bench?? LOL
MRArtman2u::Ya...just like tmac before he became elite
ncaabasketballstinks::hawks 4 magic 0
tommyb2k12::Either way, first round exit with no brightness in sight. Horford is lame. Rest of the team blows.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::you lost all credibility with the Horford lame comment, now you just sound like a sore hater.
MagicBoltzRays::Playoffs: Pacers 4 Hawks 0
ncaabasketballstinks::4-2 pacer probs
bring back kwame::pllease jesus let the hawks cover the - 12!!! NEDED THIS FOR COLLEGE SOO BADLY NEED THIS CASH MONEY! PLEASE JESUS IF YOUR REAL, PROVE IT TO ME!
inspectah_deck_WU::for sure not coverin now ha
reggieinatl::Harris, you jumped into the defender.  Contact doesn't automatically = foul.
reggieinatl::New Rule:  If a team in your state won more games in a single streak than you will all season,  you aren't allowed to trash talk.
JDAnderson94::Whose talking trash?
JDAnderson94::Hehe. Hope you guys do well in the playoffs.
reggieinatl::Will do.  He's gone now.  Past his bedtime.
JDAnderson94::reggieinatl - nupe..nupe...nupe  Eh. Ignore him. We suck right now, and we all know it.
reggieinatl::nupe..nupe...nupe
JDAnderson94::I swear Harkless has superpowers. He seems to just glide every time he jumps.
SportsFan7310::Shelvin Mack's my boy!!!!!
MagicBoltzRays::he's a scrub.
SportsFan7310::like most of the magic players?
SportsFan7310::he was a great college player
steve_cronin61::magic defense isnt that bad,  they just are unable to score points.    really need a lucky draft for a durant type baller to change things up
hawk4life2121232::Well they have a few nice volume shooters who can't play defense.
Nate_Reeves687774::You seriously should try this:  http://tinyurl.com/nba-free-draft-challenge5
reggieinatl::"The Magic make it to the NBA finals."  THANKS STUB HUB!!!
reggieinatl::Nupe, you can't win.  Give up.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::"The Hawks have a great chance of making it to the Finals this year"   - No one ever  -_-
chipper jones josh smith all atl baby::And the magic have a better channce no magic suck
Welcome To NYCity312::@Hawk Fans  You might see us 1st round.
reggieinatl::Oh and lolmets:-)
ATLrepresent11::Bahahaha Chipper wouldn't ever waste his time with the Yankees
Welcome To NYCity312::im not a mets fan lol, chipper might be yankee
reggieinatl::Also a braves fan of course.  We like laughing at the mets.  Chipper is retired so you might have some hope.
Welcome To NYCity312::lolmets?
reggieinatl::I hope so. That would be a fun series.
reggieinatl::Nupe, please pay your internet bill so you can get back to trying to get your hand pregnant.
steve_cronin61::it is catharsis for the utter horror of watching them try to play basic fundamentals
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Hawks highlight of the night:  Ivan Johnson has a double double. He's beating up on 20yr old kids.  AMAZING!
LostAussie95::Trolling because you cant accept the fact that your team is hopeless as $@%!. well played NUPE...NUPE..NUPE
hawk4life2121232::magic wont be good for a long time. they remind me of the  timberwolves
steve_cronin61::true story
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::That's fine. Rather, suck for a long time instead of the owner making money off of me selling hope.  As if the Hawks REALLY have a chance.  SIT DOWN!
hawk4life2121232::You like watching your team suck? Lol
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::BREAKING NEWS!:   With tonight's win, the Hawks have officially been eliminated in the first or second Rd of the playoffs.
reggieinatl::...as the Magic sit at home and watch.
ATLrepresent11::That's okay. We'll live in the present while you stick with the past.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Duh. You should be familiar. You guys have done it a lot.
LostAussie95::Orlando really have some nice young pieces to build around.
steve_cronin61::at least vuvecic is awesome
hawk4life2121232::that beno udrih and tobias harris guy cost the magic this game
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::"Playoffs 6 years in a row. Second round 3 of 6. Mediocre? Try again."  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  YES you moron, this is SUPER mediocre!
reggieinatl::Were we mediocre when we knocked the Magic out of the playoffs 2 years ago?
reggieinatl::I am sitting.  The point remains, we beat you in 6 when you had Howard.  Hmmm.    The bigger point.  Why are still talking?  Your fellow Magic fans aren't even jumping in to  help you. You are an idiot on an island by yourself.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::You're bragging about something two years ago??  You don't even have the same players! &amp; you got crushed in the next Rd.  SIT DOWN!
hawk4life2121232::magic suck lol
riffralph16::1st overall pick &gt;&gt;&gt; 1st round exit
chipper jones josh smith all atl baby::U are a $@%!$@ nupe 1st round is better then not making the playoffs
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Get at us when you lose in the first Rd.
UGatorsF2347::Okay and the year before that we beat you to get to the 2nd round..including an embarrassing 60+ point loss at Amway
reggieinatl::Like when we beat you 2 years ago to make it to the 2nd round.
NickMull2::Hahahaaaaa!!!!  82% of public 2nd half bet was on OVER 100 points!  LOL!
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Seriously Hawks fans? You have the audacity to bash a rebuilding Magic team?  Your constant years of meritocracy &amp; losing in the first &amp; second Rd gives you the right to bash the Magic?  You guys have been rebuilding for the past decade.  Stop it. Spare me. Please.
reggieinatl::Read the comments.  No one has bashed the Magic.    At most, we have defended our team against knuckle heads who are bashing us.  Stop playing the victim.  Very weak.
chipper jones josh smith all atl baby::Jeff is playing awful
steve_cronin61::orlando is just not talented enough to dominate a very bad team.    how they ever win a game is beyond me
cflip37::They're young They've taken tons of injuries And they just played last night
reggieinatl::"And they just played last night" -- Yeah, we were up in  Boston hanging out in Quincy Market.
steve_cronin61::thanks for supporting the point
