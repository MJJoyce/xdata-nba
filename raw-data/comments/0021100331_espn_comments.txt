KenM321::great to see Curry have another big game. Hope the ankle is healed up for good.
Soccerbum29::You are a moron Snakes. Hayword was in beast mode last night and he carried the team for the duration of the game! He was tasked with guarding Monta Ellis, one of the most proficient scorers in the game and even though Ellis went off on us it wasnt exactly a surprise. Ellis typically always works people on the offensive end. Stop thinking you are an intelligent human being and stop calling for Haywards removal, it simply will not happen
Snakes22::Monta Ellis' three games before facing Hayward.  12 for 43 FG, 28%, 29 total points, 9.7 points per game and 0 - 9 on 3PTs  Vs. Hayward: 33 points on 13 for 21 FG, 3-7 on 3PTs.  Yeah I guess you're right, it must just be a coincidence. Hayward is a defensive BEAST!!!!!
ZachC1965::Monta &gt; Kobe
tbest23::This is what the jazz do when they rarely play away games so far this year. They get pounded like a cheap tart...
supordupor23::david lee&gt;millsap
JoeBoxer249::Golden State might as well move their team to Vancouver... they're forever hopeless
Snakes22::Nice efffing defense last night!!!!!!!!!  71 second half points for the Warriors!?!?   Monta Ellis comes into this game shooting 40% on FG and less than 30% on 3PT. Who was guarding him???? Hayward?
L3BR0lV::Sucks to say it, but the jazz are probably better off just tanking from here on out and trying to pick up their missing peaces in the draft.  It's only gonna get uglier from here on out as they don't get to play tons of bad teams at home.  I mean it's quite clear that this team is missing some key parts and just can't hang with the big boys.
Wombat1247::Considering the Jazz were missing there starting 1 &amp; 2 plus there best guard , they did ok tonight - GS strength is there guards and they too advantage. Tinsley did well , more assists in 1 game than Harris for many games. Hayward &amp; Howard did well too. Corbin should've given Favors, Burks &amp; Kanter more quality mins rather than the garbage mins. We are rebuilding , we are way ahead of where I thought we would be this season.
Wombat1247::at different times both Favors &amp; Kanter have been dissapointing, but as bigs they both are 19 &amp; 20 - long way to go - at least 3/4 years before full potenetial &amp; maturity. They need more mins and confidence - they both are very capable &amp; skilled
palme24::well maybe if corbin plays him more he'll get better, i still remember his 20-11 game against philly
dmcmorris08::I would agree with that except for kanter cant put the ball in the hoop, he misses way too many easy ones
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::He needs to earn those minutes... he turns the ball over sooo much. It's sooo frustrating. I feel way more comfortable having Kanter have the ball in the post. Kanter is earning minutes.
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::Dude Favors is very disappointing so far this season with all his hype. He is pretty awful on the offensive side of the ball
PASS__THA__SWISHA::.
HiddenCounter::It's not like we'll make the playoffs anyways.  Blow it up, start new.
swaggamento916::curry the most slept on pg in the leauge
L E G O A T::Ellis=gangster
supe540::The Mississippi Gangster.  I like it.
zprince3::Our bench had ZERO assists.  Jazz lookin pretty bad right now.  Hope we get some guys back for the Lakers Saturday.
supe540::Never mind.  Watson, Bell, Harris.  That's tough.
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::Veterans
supe540::Who was missing tonight?
marcusshane4321::overs again woo hoo like taking candy from a baby these golden state games,
Phiasco2::Sigh, as enthusiastic as I've tried to be, I may give up on the jazz now and save myself another season of frustration. Heres to next year....
xo_da_legend::Sigh.. I said it last year... Trade Gasol &amp; Blake for Curry. SMH that kid will be a star.
tbest23::A skilled 7 footer and a vet guard for someone that plays half of the court? Good thing you're not a gm...
raiders415417::why is biedrins still employed?   0 points. wtf
Lebron_is_King::should have amnested his butt. charlie bell could probably defend centers the same way andris defends them - by fouling.
raiders415417::or trade him... What is his value?
DoubleV1369::there is no value for him, especially with his contract. guy wont go strong to the hoop offensively because hes terrified of the foul line and he doesnt bang like he should for rebounds because of foul trouble at times on defense.
C00kieMonst3r::Stats don't say everything. He played one hell of defensive game today.
raiders415417::11 million for his decent defense...cut him

taylorpfister::too bad the Jazz got nothing in return for their superstar unlike the Nuggets hahahah
dmcmorris08::Really, I dont think youll be sayin that in a couple years when the jazz are in the finals!!!
scow79::where the hell was CJ Smiles in the second half.   His defense would have surely made the difference
pidge_25::As much as it would mean to Jazz players and fans to make the playoffs, I think not making the playoffs this year and hopefully getting Golden State's pick is best for our future.  We can't completely avoid rebuilding
pidge_25::Appreciate it.  The way our point guards are getting injured, we may have to borrow Robinson for a game or two
pidge_25::Thanks.  GS has a crazy good backcourt.  Hopefully Mark Jackson can help you put it all together
C00kieMonst3r::Haha thanks. Good luck against the Lakers.
C00kieMonst3r::You guys have a good team no doubt. You just need that one special player.
C00kieMonst3r::Ellis has achieved redemption for his boo-boo in the last meeting.
