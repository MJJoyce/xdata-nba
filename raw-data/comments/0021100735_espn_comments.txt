bustasports::full nba 2011 re-draft  kenneth faried 2nd pick, enes kanter 17th  this was actually a good draft, but the draft order wasn't right  http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/2012/03/full-20...
cellus24::blake griffin had a monster night with that dunk in the 3rd quarter and the foul on ariza http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzdAINOuH5k&amp;feature=channel
PSHS_football::Derrick Rose is the best PG in the league no question about it.  Paul's #'s just aren't impressive, and Deron Williams is more of a cancer to every team he goes to than anything.  Meanwhile Derrick Rose at age 24 is leading the Bulls to a 40-11 season.
gt1master_ike::So Rose who has missed a third of the bulls games is leading them??
buckshotz17::rose can't even stay on the damn court!!! lol...   go back in your cave son! CP3 is the best pure point guard in the league hands down.
drmcfunk::Its funny how the Clippers are playing awful most the season yet we are still in 4th place above the defending champs.  i can't wait to see how good we are when we get back in a rhythm
NBA_refs_are_weak::I didnt get to watch this, so of course as soon as I see the boxscore I looked under the flagrant/tech fouls and was delighted to see blake's name. was it a good one? I knew it was coming. and hey, if ariza has an issue with it, take it up with ya boy jason smith. he brought that on you
OptimusPrime4.0::Al Faruq Amino showed what he was capable of doing in those 25 minutes he played... Hopefully he gets plenty of playing time the rest of the season to showcase his talents
crawnjc1982::still doesn't change the fact that del sucko must go.
BTinMoney::dear espn,  why is it in every article written about the clippers, you mention the failed trade to the Lakers?  like no one knows?  kobe lovers still have hurt feelings and they have to bring it up all the time...waaaah!!!!
manning48911::thats why their in 4 place right now
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::We don't cry about it. Immglad he vetoed the trade. I would rather have sessions+pau than cp3 anyday. Lakers aren't in third for nothing. You should and wonder If the clippers are gonna Make the playoffs

99LALO::Yeah fuccc! gayallen!
chucknorris3298293::tomorrow i like 6rs and spurs.. easy money
sr271982::OH $@%! AT MY BOOK THEIR MINUS 2
sr271982::true spurs should whip the suns $@%......suns playing better lately I dont think those teams are gonna run i have a feeling theyll play it like a playoff game........UNDER
chucknorris3298293::total is shady.... take spurs -3 easy money and safe bet. spurs healthy are hard to beat.. who the f are suns frauds
99LALO::Thats what im saying guys damn sun can't do $@%! tomy Spurs hahahaha!
kidd_p28::WATS DA WAGER?
sr271982::SPURS HAVE WON ALOT OF GAMES IN A ROW THEY ARE DO FOR A LOSS THATS THE ONLY THING
chucknorris3298293::who cares.. i will keep playing them until they lose.. they are $$$$$$$$
vions::Clippers can forget about passing the second round of playoffs since they only have 4 offensive players with Point/Minute ratio higher than 1/2: CP3, Griffin, Williams, and Young. For the rest of the team the P/M ratio is typically 1/3 to 1/4. For starters like Butler and Foye the low productivity simply won't cut it. This is why they faded.  They will have a chance if they can acquire two more players with P/M ratio of 1/2.
sr271982::When gordon gets healthy hes going to be a real super star and kaman is arguably the best center in the league
sr271982::Sometime I kind of wish they still had kaman and gordon...Look I know im going to get alot of $@%! but I didnt like the trade at first....for paul that is
sr271982::But he could shoot the lights out....and williams is an all star pg in my opinion...and bledsoe hell coming off the bench.........they could of picked up caron and everybody else
vions::I know how you feel. Kaman is not doing too well right now, and Gordon has been injured. Gordon is undersized and does not have a jump shot.
vions::I heard he ranked pretty high in lock-up defense. His P/M seems to be higher than Foye and Butler in general too.
vions::Young.
sr271982::???Who evans
Ray Allen Fan91::Young is trash so...
vions::They do need to change the starting lineup. Though they also need to split the high P/M players between starting and backup units to maintain scoring. For the time being, the starting unit has CP3 and Griffin, the backup unit has Williams and Young. The problem is having 2 high P/M players in each unit is simply not enough.
Ray Allen Fan91::GOOD IDEA
sr271982::THEY NEED TO CHANGE THAT STARTING 5........IT SHOULD BE CP WILLIAMS EVANS BLAKE AND BUTLER.......LET JORDAND COME OFF THE BENCH AND RUN HIM LIKE THE LAKERS DO BYNUM AS A HIGH PERCENTAGE SCORING OPTION.....HIM BLEDSOE YOUNG FOYE KMART
kidd_p28::GOTS TO GET BACK TO 500 MARK ASAP
kidd_p28::I KNOW, I USED 20 AND MADE 800 DEN LOST IT ALL..
kidd_p28::OKC
sr271982::DONT RUSH THATS HOW I ALWAYS $@% MYSELF UP......JUST REMEMBER THE NUMBERS ALWAYS AN ILLUSION YOU WIN LOSE WIN THEN LOSE AGAIN YOULL SEE
Ray Allen Fan91::DO YOU EVEN LIKE ANY TEAMS
chucknorris3298293::tomorrpw parlay penguins and bruins... for easy money. penguins will crush isles and bruins are getting hot

kidd_p28::HEAT DID ME WORSE THIS LAST WEEK
sports7999::I remember when 10 teams use to average over 100 points a game.  What is there now 2 or 3?
sports7999::I'm still waiting for the NBA to get into the scoring mode again...  it's slowly starting to happen, but this game was a fluke!!
kidd_p28::ALL I NEEDED WAS 2 POINTS
kidd_p28::I SHULD HAVE BET ON EVERYTHING UNDER11 THREES..
sports7999::if it weren't for the Hornets terrible D, this game woulda been a 160 over/under
kidd_p28::NO, OVER 86. AND +3 SECOND HALF..

Ray Allen Fan91::NFL #1 sport
99LALO::He made a team move then they got better sucking a true thug hASS garnett!
99LALO::Cuz fagllen and sux
Ray Allen Fan91::WTF
mcozone::First glance for Tuesday: OKC ML, Wild u5.  Not much else looks good.
OptimusPrime4.0::Who thinks the NBA is rigged??? Im still on the fence not sure what to believe.... But seeing that the knicks shot 18 free throws in the 3rd qt of their game and the bucks shot 0 makes me think the league is
sr271982::I DONT KNOW IF ITS RIGGED BRO IVE SEEN SOME STRANGE $@%! IN BASEBALL, BASKETBALL FOOTBALL POKER....SOMETIMES THE MATH REALLY PLAYS A HUGE PART....ALSO ASK YOURSELF HOW WOULD IT WORK AND WHY??
mcozone::I'm a bucks fan (and was on them for this game- usually am not), their were maybe 2 egregious in 2nd half, but the FT disparity was simple- the bucks just stopped taking the ball to the hoop.
Hibachiarenas::As a Wizards fan, i think the fault always lies with Nick Young. You LAC fans are just learning this?
99LALO::Well that being said get your team suuux! Hibiach!
BillyJoelsSecondWifeFan::Everybody knows it.. who has eyes)))
Danglehossa::And the clippers get outscored 13 to 0 in the last minutes of the game, so the second half line doesn't hit. That should never happen to a team like the clippers
anonymous_sports_watcher__::Tim Donaghy thinks so
Danglehossa::Fuking $@%!$@%! that a team stops trying in the last 3 minutes. Only a garbage coach would let that happen. Play hard for the whole game because we pay you to play for the whole game
sr271982::I BET LAKERS SMOKE THE WARRIORS TOMMORROW
sr271982::THERE GOING TO RUN A TRAIN ON WARRIORS

Calvin20111::Yeah I  know what you're saying but 2 morrow he will sHow up  and  bog hog the ball and try to dominate the game as if he's the Michael Jordan
Calvin20111::You would think so after Kobe got yanked.

RapCity26::NO scored 30 points in the 4th. If you watched the game thats amazing!
xtreme1002003::FT's were killing us all game. Thankfully I got the over at 181.5.
sr271982::IMAGINE HE MISSES BOTH??...HAHAHA ITS HAPPENED BEFORE
