ohiocat110::Well done Coach Scott. No doubt about the end of the season tanking. Break out to a lead in the 1st then shut it down to secure the L. Don't risk injuries, get the scrubs some minutes, and make those lottery balls a little friendlier.
68steve13::I’ve been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 3 months straight now following this system. I found this system by Google searching the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for  anyone that is looking for a system that actually works and is tired of not winning your bets
blarneyguy::Wiz fan who thought the day would never, ever come that he would feel sorry for the Cleveland Cavaliers.  Here's to better days ahead for both teams.
vanauker::What a screwed up team the Wizards are.  They manage to win games when they mean almost nothing.  The only thing more fitting is if this winning streak actually hurt their lottery chances.  Because it would be just like this team to figure out how to do that.
Dave667362::The Wizards have #2 slot sewn up, they started winning when they couldn't go any lower. Clev threw the game, took out their starters out  after 1st quarter, just like many of the bottom teams. The art is not to make it to obvious.
blarneyguy::Nope.  This is a foretaste of things to come.  They're jelling.  I'm actually looking forward to next year.
Jirk Nowitzki::i knew the cavs were worse than their record says
KingGeorge53::Good for you.
KingGeorge53::sa330206  To answer your question, if it's head to head losses against the teams, Cavs will get more ping pong balls compared to NO (0-1 record) and Toronto (1-3), but we beat Sacramento in the only meeting so they'd have the higher # of ping pong balls.   That puts us at 4.  Doesn't mean we'll get the 4th pick in the first round.   Just means will get the 4th most ping pong balls when the lottery dude turns on the air for the ping pong ball shuffle.
420floyd::and i don't hate cleveland, i like a lot of the rappers that have come out of there such as bone thugs, kid cudi, and chip tha ripper
JoeGrizly::they all suck except bone... kid cudi is garbage, chip tha ripper is a house n1ggah and machine gun kelly needs to be punched in the face
Buck10489::Dont forget the up and comer Machine Gun Kelly
420floyd::eh?
BillyRussell::Personally, I always looked at miami as a bunch of old people who are fans of teams from other states and immigrants that can barely afford to go to games. Hilarious how once a franchise becomes good, all of miami flocks to it. Where are the miami marlins fans? Nowhere. Dolphins fans? Nowhere. Heat fans? All over.   Joke.
Legit_Troller::There is nothing in Miami except Hurricanes and Geriatrics.
420floyd::i have been to miami buddy, nice try though
sa330206::If Miami is so good then why did Forbes give them the honor of most miserable city?  http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45hdlg/1-miami-fla/#gallerycontent
KingGeorge53::If you had, you could add with intelligence to the conversation instead of trolling with ignorant comments based on bias.
420floyd::they prolly have better things to do like go to a club or the beach
BillyRussell::im sure the beach is a lot of fun when it is thunderstorming 1/2 the time
KingGeorge53::I know the answer to that 420floyd b/c I've been there and seen it.   You on the other hand don't know b/c you haven't.   So you post based on ignorant bias.  Again, 420floyd, your mother is calling you to come to bed.   It's past your bedtime.
sa330206::Who wins the tiebreaker between Cavs, Kings, and Hornets if they all finish with 21 wins?  (By wins I mean who gets more balls in the lottery machine).  Hopefully the Hornets can pull off a win against the Rockets.  I see the Cavs and Kings both losing.
sa330206::Well we can always hope!  Once everyone is healthy (and with another high draft pick), I realistically see them fighting for the 6-8 seed next year.  Luckily Jamison will be gone as well.. we just have to pray Andy stays healthy!
sa330206::Any idea if it goes just by place (ex: last place gets 10 balls, next 8, etc) or if its number of wins?  If Cavs can pull off being the 3rd worst team they might have a shot at the #1 pick again!!
KingGeorge53::They got the #1 pick last year with the 8th worst record ping pong balls from the Clippers last season.      Their 4th pick last season, Tristan Thompson, came from having the second worst record.    So a person never knows how that's all going to come out until the day they turn on the air for the ping pong ball shuffle.
KingGeorge53::Cavs will lose for sure against the Bulls even though the Bulls will most likely sit their starters for most of the game.  That's a good question though.     Normally when you look at a tie breaker you look at who won the most head to head, but since we're talking ping pong balls, would it be who lost the most head to head?
420floyd::why did cavs fans get so upset at lebron, i mean seriously who wouldn't chose miami over cleveland? LOL
420floyd::good night troller
Legit_Troller::Good Night 420floyd
420floyd::go away cleveland gutter ball
KingGeorge53::It's my thread and I post with intelligence.    What's a Piston fan that doesn't watch his own team b/c they stink doing on a Cav/Wiz thread when you've already stated you say are bad?    The answer to that is trolling.
KingGeorge53::btw, LBJ is old news.   We got Kyrie Irving.   He can close games.  Go pretend like you're in the old days 420
KingGeorge53::You see ignorant troll?   That's the difference between a fan of the sport and a fan of bragging about things you don't know.   I like to watch the game first and foremost.   I've enjoyed this season b/c I enjoyed watching Irving and TT grow.    I enjoyed watching all the D League players to see which ones, if any, can be used in our run to the PO next season.    To see how they might be used as backups or possibly finding a diamond in the rough.  You on the other hand wouldn't know what your own team has b/c you don't watch it.   go to bed.
KingGeorge53::go away ignorant troll.
420floyd::correction i don't watch the pistons when they suck cause its not worth my time
KingGeorge53::420floyd, you don't know b/c you admitted you don't watch the games.   If you had been watching the games, I might ask you why you made such a comment.   But b/c you admit to your ignorance, you're just trolling.
420floyd::and king george no i watch basketball just not bottom feeders
420floyd::improved but no playoffs
Legit_Troller::Clearly you don't know nothing about the Cavs. They could of won another 8-10 wins this season if everyone was healthy. So what do you think they will do next season?
KingGeorge53::How would you know?  You admit to not watching any basketball.
420floyd::8 seed at best in the next 5 years
BillyRussell::they have the same number of rings, as of right now
KingGeorge53::coming attraction
420floyd::playoffs?
KingGeorge53::Irving already has more game winning buzzer beaters in his rookie season than James has his entire career.   Go to bed troll.
420floyd::pretty sure lebron took your franchise out of the gutter in like a year or two, doesn't look like kyrie is capable of doing that
420floyd::die hards of crappy teams always crack me up, im a pistons fan and there is no way i would pay to watch them play right now
KingGeorge53::That's right.    I'm a Cavalier fan posting on a Cavalier/Wizard thread.    You're a frustrated Piston fan that's talking trash on a Cavs/Wiz thread.    That's called being a troll.
420floyd::i ain't even mad
420floyd::look whos calling someone a troll
KingGeorge53::It has been enjoyable watching sports.   Have fun being angry all the time.
420floyd::ok cleveland sports fan hahah it must be fun cheering for teams that always let you down and most of the time just suck
KingGeorge53::and there you go.   The Troll admits he knows nothing b/c he hasn't seen it.    Go to bed troll.   You're mother is calling.
420floyd::no hence im not paying to watch them right now, ill watch a few on tv but im not into paying for sub par performance but whatever floats your boat
RaptorsJaysGiants::Are the Pistons good troll?
KingGeorge53::go to bed 420floyd.    You're way over your head.    We tend to like the game of basketball and if we choose to watch the sport, it's our business.   If you wish to troll other people's boards to show you are unfaithful to your team and the sport, try another board.
Legit_Troller::Why go to a game when the team isn't good and you can watch it on TV? Now next season is a different story I may go too some Cavs games.
420floyd::good for you, your a raptors die hard, must be so rewarding tell me how much have you spent going to raptors games to watch them suck?
420floyd::no i'll still follow the team, im just smart with my money and am not going to pay for poor play
KingGeorge53::So what you're saying is you're a bandwagon fan.     Living off the fortunes of someone else b/c you can't make up your mind.  P a t h e t i c
RaptorsJaysGiants::cuz ur not a true fan just a fairweather PATHETIC
RaptorsJaysGiants::atleast cleveland has true fans unlike miami, where were they when they won 17 games while Wade was injured? nowhere to be found.
420floyd::would you pay to watch a team that won 17 games and didn't have their superstar? also people in miami have more options and better ones than to watch a team win 17 games
Legit_Troller::Just so you know 420floyed because a franchise didn't win a championship doesn't mean they didn't have a really good team. The best Cavs team really wasn't even when we had Lebron it was in the 90s which was the hardest era to play in. If they where not in the Jordan era they could of gone to the Finals and potentially won. MJ beat everyone. Why do you think some of other good players like Barkley, or Reggie just to name a few never won it was because MJ. IF it wasn't for that Bulls team we would probably see 3-6 different team win a championship.
HateBrass::Once again you need to get facts straight.  The 1989 Cavs dominated the Central Division for much of that season until Detroit caught them and passed them. They won 57 games and choked in the first round against the Bulls.  As for Jordan beating everyone, Detroit owned Jordan and the Bulls in 1988, 1989 and 1990 in the playoffs and in the regular season in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991.
420floyd::the kings have had really good teams too, they are still a garbage franchise, less then the cavs, but still garbage
420floyd::well being eminem would be nice and 8 mile is a classic movie
Alex818728::you could be Eminem...
420floyd::well im white so chances are slim that i do haha
RaptorsJaysGiants::y ru denying that u live in detroit every1 knows u do
420floyd::acutally i don't, and this is coming from the raptors fan, another garbage franchise
RaptorsJaysGiants::u live in detroit dude
Alex818728::hes a mad piston fan, still mad they drafted darko over Carmelo
420floyd::nothing they are quite good
Alex818728::whats wrong with BTH?
420floyd::and ur still mad that all cleveland is known for is losing, and bone thugs n harmony
RaptorsJaysGiants::Enough proof Cav fans?
RaptorsJaysGiants::http://raptorsrepublic.com/forums/showthread.php?6411-Spurs-Offering-Tony-Parker-Looking-to-draft-Valanciunas-%28See-post-74%29  theres the link
316Eli::WINNING
316Eli::Kyrie Irving and Bradley Beal &gt; The whole Raptors roster
Legit_Troller::Just because he came out of d league doesn't mean he is garbage. He has showed potential. he is averaging over 10pts a game with over 5 rebounds per game. Yea he is not a stud but he is strong and very athletic that can shoot the ball pretty well.
RaptorsJaysGiants::ok add varejao too but Gee is d league garbage
Legit_Troller::Irving/TT/Gee/Varejao...and draft pick
RaptorsJaysGiants::That might be true about Kyrie but Beal is overrated and we have a better supporting cast and have some decent players unlike the Cavs you guys have Irving/TT/draft pick and that's it.
316Eli::We didn't take since Kyrie is still recovering, i cant wait til the Cavs destroy the Raptors next year while your so called prodigy is still overseas
RaptorsJaysGiants::He will be here next year and we owned you guys this year imagine what we will do to u guys next year with him and another top 5 LMAO
316Eli::actually i really have and you're trolling because this is a CAVS-WIZARDS post and you're a RAPTORS fan so go complain about the Raptors in your own chat room cuz frankly you're very annoying....so learn how to read......illiteracy at its finest
RaptorsJaysGiants::it's wrong for me to say tanking shouldn't be apart of the game im an NBA fan and that was a disgraceful sight of tanking at its finest
316Eli::ok first off the European League is a joke and almost every overseas player that goes to the NBA is terrible, plus he is playing for the Raptors, so he has to be terrible
RaptorsJaysGiants::ur just trolling and aren't stating facts lmao
316Eli::Yes u r cuz u think ur Raptors are amazing u have an injury prone power forward/center, an overated overseas player who is gonna be a bust and a terrible fanbase......
RaptorsJaysGiants::I guess u can see into the future genius how is he gonna be a bust when he's won every european award and won the FIBA U-18 MVP and owned the US, you're just mad hes gonna be better then TT.
316Eli::Chandler is a solid, franchise center.....RaptorsJaysGiants ur an idiot and u have no idea what ur talking about and ur team blows and will never be good so put that in ur pipe and smoke it
RaptorsJaysGiants::So Chandler is a franchise player and I'm the idiot LMAO!!!
T.watson28::I don't like Gasol either. I don't like the Lakers roster very much anyways but I would rather have his brother over him.
Alex818728::dont disrespect Chandler the dudes a beast he is the sole reason Dallas won, Id rather have him than Dwight
RaptorsJaysGiants::not disrespecting him hes just not a franchise player
T.watson28::Yeah, their whole team is old. If they could trade out a few pieces to get a few young guys then duh you would do that. Even though the guy hasn't came to the league yet and he might not ever so........ sorry the Cavs got Kyrie and he is actually player while your player is playing for a second rate Euro team playing against other second rate players.
Alex818728::this year but he wasnt last year
RaptorsJaysGiants::is he the best player on his team?
Alex818728::and you do have to take in account SA would have been able to keep george hill if they did that trade and some people thought hill was better than parker at the time
RaptorsJaysGiants::The Spurs did want to draft him even on draft night the announcers said they really wanted Val, have u seen highlights of him hes a better version of Gasol.
316Eli::Noah starts and so does Chandler....explain how that is a role player
T.watson28::I'm sorry that doesn't help you at all. The  fact of the matter is he isn't here, he might never be here, and just because he plays well over here or there doesn't mean he is a beast in the NBA. A lot of players have been bust coming out of these other places. He might be big but that doesn't mean he will be good and it also doesn't mean he won't have injuries. He MIGHT be a good player but who knows I am just saying compared to an aging roster some youth might have been nice for the Spurs BUT they didn't trade and never said they would draft him soooooo.........
RaptorsJaysGiants::chandler,noah are role player this guy will be a legit franchise center
316Eli::dude ur full of garbage.....did u say today's centers arent good? Dwight Howard, Andrew Bynum, Tyson Chandler, Joakim Noah, Roy Hibbert, Marc Gasol, etc.....u are an idiot
RaptorsJaysGiants::He dominated the US players who were playing in this past years NCAA what's that tell u? and he won the MVP for Lithuania
Alex818728::But for the record I never said Valconias was  going to be bad, I just said I wouldnt have drafted someone who wasnt going to play this season
Alex818728::This week we've been in close game with memphis and San antonio
RaptorsJaysGiants::we played our best players tho like barg/derozan thats not tanking and when we lost we've been in mostly every game this year except maybe 3 or 4
Alex818728::Still think it would have been a bad trade  for SA, but he could be the NBA is weak at Center, but like ive been saying how can you get mad at a team for tanking when your team was willing to give up a whole year to wait on this guy?
RaptorsJaysGiants::He will be a top 3 center cuz todays centers aren't even tht good but the Spurs wanted the Pick to draft Val.
Alex818728::it says they wanted a lottery pick never said they would pick Valcunias, if i were you id be mad my team didnt take parker hes having an MVP worthy year
RaptorsJaysGiants::no thx valanciunas will be better in the long run that just proves how good he is
papasmurff11::Im real happy with my wiz they arent too hot this year but you have to respect they try hard even when they know the season is over.  I think they can really do well next year if we can get a good pf or sf in the draft (Thomas Robinson or Gilchrist-Kidd).  I am calling making the playoffs next season. with another off season for ALL of our young players to develop.
420floyd::cavs and raptors fans arguing about who has more history is hilarious, if it wasn't for lebron the cavs would have just as much history as the raptors
mikeyp2307::go smoke your troubles away hippie
420floyd::hey mikey the 1950s called they want their morals back
Alex818728::whats your team?
420floyd::hey theyre messing up right now, but 3 titles to 0 so i think the pistons win that argument
Alex818728::and the Pistons are a respectable team? you guys blow after the championship you front office has been idiotic Iverson for BIllip? terrible  signing gordon and villinueva dumb
420floyd::the pistons
mikeyp2307::i wish espn had an ignore feature
316Eli::Raptors fan hating because his team blows and the Cavs have a great future with Kyrie Irving while he insists that this Jonas V is gonna be a beast cuz he did good in the European league......
316Eli::and we were gonna get Amare for Hickson and Ilgauskas...RUMORS....ever hear of them Raptors fan.....u must have because all of those years of you thinking the Raptors were good when it turns out they havent done anything? and the Cavs suck? Good Joke...... Cavs fan for life
RaptorsJaysGiants::why did the Spurs offer Tony Parker for him if he sucks?
Alex818728::Do you have a link to that story cause I do not believe they would give up Parker for someone who wasnt even coming to the NBA
mikeyp2307::link. i want a frickin link to this
Alex818728::Only time Ive seen tanking in the NBA is Golden state with that trade but beside that i dont believe that pro athlete would give up a game
RaptorsJaysGiants::Mark Jackson is a terrible coach another reason why that franchise will always be a joke
HateBrass::And he GUARANTEED a playoff berth this year.
mikeyp2307::everything is a joke to you. you must be laughing all the time
RaptorsJaysGiants::Honest question Cav fans if LBJ wanted to come back would u take him?
KingGeorge53::LeBron can't finish like Kyrie Irving can
Alex818728::Would you guys give chris Bosh a maximum contract if he asked to come back?
Alex818728::Varajao&gt;Bargani
RaptorsJaysGiants::Barg was playing at an all star level before he got injured so not by much
mikeyp2307::better than what you have now
RaptorsJaysGiants::no1 cared when he left why would we want him back lol?
The Bostrich Nest::i would
Alex818728::I would but if he is willing to take a reduced contract and willing to be second fiddle, obviously hes great but Cavs lose all respect if they diss lebron then beg him to come back, Lebron would have to make a public apology
Chris287907::not until after we win a title without him
420floyd::oh im sorry the 1950s browns sorry wow that was really recent
mikeyp2307::420floyd - which will never ever happen, you should know this being a cleveland sports fan, when was the last time cleveland won something  the 1940s Indians?  ahh the browns
420floyd::which will never ever happen, you should know this being a cleveland sports fan, when was the last time cleveland won something  the 1940s Indians?
The Bostrich Nest::so i guess never lol
mikeyp2307::Holy super $@%! @raptor. I have never come across in all my 20 years someone as stupid as you. Go get yourself checked out for brain trauma. Something is seriously wrong with you.
mikeyp2307::and you are just an absolutely pathetic moron
RaptorsJaysGiants::ur just mad u cant handle the truth
420floyd::Top 10 Cavs Players of all time:  1. Lebron 2. couldn't tell ya
HateBrass::(1) LBJ (2) Mark Price (3) Brad Daugherty (4) Larry Nance (5) Ron Harper (6) Bingo Smith (7) Austin Carr (8) Campy Russell (9) Terrell Brandon (10) Phil Hubbard
420floyd::yeah im a basketball fan, i just watch franchises that matter sorry
420floyd::well its more than that, and why would i watch bottom feeders?
mikeyp2307::so thats 2 franchises then. You're a frontrunner basically.
mikeyp2307::some basketball fan you are
Alex818728::Brad Daughtery, Mark Price, Austin Carr, World B free you obviously dont watch basketball
420floyd::LOL wow the cavs have some history give me a break
Chris287907::its kinda sad that the raptors are giving it 100 percent and only have one more win than the team that loses on purpose
Chris287907::the message board would be so much better without the following: 420floyd RaptorsJaysGiants
420floyd::you mad?
Chris287907::and they arent takin that chance very well
RaptorsJaysGiants::Cavs would be so much better without the following: Purposely losing.
Alex818728::it make sense to at the end of the year play your bench and see what you have, what good is playing Irving you know hes a star
RaptorsJaysGiants::young talent? the d league scrubs are like 28 dude
Chris287907::again the cavs arent purposely losing we are just giving young talent a chance to shine
mikeyp2307::im out. ive had enough of this retard. I can only take so much stupidity in one day and im over my limit. Peace out cavs fans.
Steven57928::Well i'm out.  I hope the lone raptor fan has a good time.  he's been here for a few hours so...............
420floyd::the nba would be so much better without the following: cavs kings raptors nets bobcats hornets
420floyd::if they were contracted the overall quality of teams would be a lot better
Alex818728::I dont really think any team should be contracted everyteam outside of charlotte does have talent just need some new manegment
RaptorsJaysGiants::take raps and cavs off that list
Legit_Troller::LOL @ Raptor fans. They really have have NO COMMON sense do they. I would rather talk to the Wall then debate with them. They are so ignorant and naive it is amusing listening to them post comments on a Cavs/Wizards board. I used to think Heat bandwagon fans were the worst but I was wrong. Raptor fans take the cake.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Knick fans are the worst
Alex818728::finally something that makes sense
yata9arasu::It is one fan.  They usually have good and intelligent fans.
Legit_Troller::Usually. But there was actually 2 raptors fans on here before and one dumba.ss Spurs fan.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Pacers have the worst NBA attendance and there the 3rd seed in the East and yet u say contract RAPS LMAO
HateBrass::That happned once Larry Bird took over the team and they had all those discipline issues.
Chris287907::please just tell me why as a raptors fan you are on the Cavs Wizards board
RaptorsJaysGiants::cuz ur team was tanking
Alex818728::ok you are right raptors do get good attendance but so do cavs
mikeyp2307::pacers: 3rd best team in the east. raptors:suck
RaptorsJaysGiants::ok why dont they sell out if there 3rd seed genius
mikeyp2307::maybe if the raptors had decent management they wouldnt be a lottery team every season.
Alex818728::ok im out, have fun trolling troll
yata9arasu::Me too.  See you on the Tribe board!  :)  Good night!
yata9arasu::Okay I am done.  It is clear that when you disprove every statement someone made and they keep repeating it that something is wrong.  I give up.  EVERY FRANCHISE HAS TRIED TO TANK!  MAGIC HAVE 3 #1 picks, THEY GOT 2 BACK TO BACK #1 PICKS!  DID THEY TANK?  Spurs got Duncan.  Heat almost got Rose, etc.  GIVE IT UP!
JoeGrizly::lol no they didn't tank they just sucked!! omg 17-65 i'll never forget watching that trash hahahah
Alex818728::got us Lebron
Alex818728::and I dont think were tanking now
Chris287907::I dunno if that was tanking. We were just awful that year.
T.O.G.M.S.17::back for one quick question: who the hell is DJ Kennedy and why was he our leading scorer
playa15steve::Played for St. Johns and came from the d-league
Chris287907::our starters only played like 5 minutes
mikeyp2307::d leaguer they picked up
Chris287907::List of NBA franchises that should be contracted or moved: Bobcats Raptors  Kings
mikeyp2307::you know what. contract the raptors and then give them back. contract them again. give them back. repeat
RaptorsJaysGiants::add cavs to that list for purposely losing and spitting in the face of the fans that were watching the game live
420floyd::if it wasn't for lebron for a few years you guys would have as much history as the raptors
Steven57928::Yes the NBA will get rid of a team that even when they suck has a great attendance record
RaptorsJaysGiants::thts the bucks not us
Chris287907::The Cavs are just two years removed from the best record in the league. The raptors havent done sh"t in their history
Alex818728::except last year we were 3rd in the league in attendance, your mad that your team tanked and still wont get a good draft pick
Giggity.iggity::I hope the Raptors fall out of the top 7 simply because of one fan.  Is that wrong?
Steven57928::not at all
Alex818728::why they wont win regardless, they were a lottery team with Bosh, none of these player are better than bosh
Chris287907::No in my opinion that is a nice reaction. I hope the franchise gets contracted now.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Raps 17 in attendance, Cavs 25 try hard
Alex818728::yet Cavs have much better attendance
RaptorsJaysGiants::Raps being contracted that's hilarious, moving a team thats the 4th largest NBA city
mikeyp2307::nope.
Chris287907::the cavs dont truly try to lose we just put player in the game that have no chance to win with
Giggity.iggity::Lol.. yep.
Chris287907::Im still trying to comprehend why a raptors fan is in here
Alex818728::I mean hes been here for a long $@% time I came out late in the game and he was here and hasnt left
Steven57928::again it's because they suck even when they try 100%.  since the Cavs are "tanking" and the raptors with 100% effort have only 1 more win.
yata9arasu::ROFL!
mikeyp2307::their pissed the cavs tank was so epic. They cant comprehend why their team sucks at sucking
Alex818728::cause then need to feel better about themselves
420floyd::the only cleveland sports team i take seriously are the indians, the cavs and the browns are a disgrace to pro sports
mikeyp2307::drugs are for losers
420floyd::and who says im coping with anything, excuse me for having a good time
420floyd::hmmm using your logic the beatles were losers, LOL at anti drug people
mikeyp2307::what? the fact you smoke just to cope makes you a loser. sorry. its true
420floyd::ok old man hahaha is michael phelps a loser? get with it buddy
Chris287907::you have 420 in your name so i cannot take anything you ever say seriously
420floyd::look out we got an anti weed guy over here
RaptorsJaysGiants::Yep tanking for a lottery pick and who knows if it will work out or not and totally disrespecting the sport
Alex818728::dude i dont know what you problem is, The Raptors are a joke of a franchise and tank more than anyone
Alex818728::Then your not a real fan
Alex818728::becuase the cavs were bad for two years their embaressing? everyteam has gone through that kind of stretch, as for the Browns I really dont have a defense for them
420floyd::im not a cleveland sports fan, im saying i don't take the browns and the cavs seriously, those franchises are embarrassing
mikeyp2307::yup. sure are. such a disgrace. bomb em off the planet
ZachRamsfelder::Davis is overrated as an NBA player. He's tall, but he's not big. Other big men will destroy him if he doesn't bulk up.
Chris287907::Davis will win defensive player of the year in his first 3 seasons atleast once
yata9arasu::If someone told me I had to gain 15-20 lbs of muscle to make myself into an MVP/HOF candidate I would be in the gym every day.  He has the motor and determination.
Alex818728::kevin Love isnt that big either
mikeyp2307::he will bulk up.
RaptorsJaysGiants::KG was also tall but not big and how did his career turn out?
316Eli::u talk about other players on other teams, like the great KG cuz u cant talk about any of the garbage players on the Raptors
316Eli::will u shut up? U make the stupidest comments. U are a Raptors fan so just leave this chat room....
mikeyp2307::some people are just so GoshDamn stupid it makes my head hurt.
blarneyguy::When was the last time the Wiz had you looking forward to next year?
Chris287907::MKG will sure look good in Wine and Gold next year
Chris287907::well davis ofcourse and i think beal is over rated
markhud712::yes he will
yata9arasu::Or Davis/Beal.  :D
markhud712::if you only knew the $@%!$@%! lebron did behind the scenes during his time here and how it was always covered up
yata9arasu::Yeah.  He sure did.  James had no part in that.  Like spitting in the face of his home state/franchise on national tv.
RaptorsJaysGiants::They will leave once they get a chance cuz of your pathetic owner who throws the best player in franchise history under the bus
van4city20::the only team more pathetic than the cavs are the Bobcats... but it is close.
Chris287907::no the bobcats actually try to win, the Cavs try to lose and still the games are close
Alex818728::I dont understand how you can believe players on ten day contract and expiring deal would give up games, and possible millions of dollars just to give the team some mor elottery balls, does that even make sense please explain that to me?
RaptorsJaysGiants::there in the d league for a reason...there garbage
Giggity.iggity::Lol, seriously.  The Cavs could have drafted a guy who wasn't coming over this season and they would have been even worse.  Then you would've been like "oh, stupid Cavs tanking when they drafted someone who wouldn't even play for them"..
Alex818728::dude the biggest way to tank is drafting someone who wont even play
RaptorsJaysGiants::tanking is obvious dude don't try to make it seem like you guys aren't
Alex818728::agreed doesnt mean their tanking theyre trying their hardest
mikeyp2307::or they were never giving a chance, geez ur stupid
Chris287907::just curious why the hell is there a $@%!ing Raptors fan in here
Steven57928::the raptors suck so bad that when they try they still only have one more win than a "tanking" Cavs team
Giggity.iggity::I don't care what anyone says about Byron Scott.  Kyrie has already said that he's a good coach and that's more coach support in a paragraph than I saw for the entire time LeBron was here.  LBJ would always throw his coaches under the bus and/or hint that he wanted them gone to the media.  This kid has shown maturity well beyond his years and probably half of the NBA players combined.  I'm excited for next season already, and that's something I couldn't say at all after last year.  Go Cavs! http://www.waitingfornextyear.com/2012/04/irving-on-si-poll-byron-scott-one-of-the-best-coaches-in-the-nba/
mikeyp2307::I NEED PROOF OF SCOTT TELLING HIS PLAYERS TO QUIT
RaptorsJaysGiants::Casey &gt; Scott atleast he doesn't tell his players to quit
RaptorsJaysGiants::Scott doesn't have 1 as any kind of COACH
Giggity.iggity::Byron Scott has plenty of rings as a player.  Just $@%! already.  Just because your coach got a ring as an ASSISTANT doesn't mean he can single-handedly lead a team to the promise land.  Not saying he can't, but he hasn't done it himself and neither has Scott.  As far as I'm concerned, Scott is still the better coach as he's actually taken his team AS A HEAD COACH to the finals.
Chris287907::byron scott has 3 rings actually
Steven57928::Scott has 3. since we are going to count time spent when neither were HEAD COACHES
RaptorsJaysGiants::who has a ring?
Steven57928::Because Casey has had More success as a HEAD coach right?
yata9arasu::2 NBA Finals + Hornets=Top team in West for a couple years.
Giggity.iggity::They're both good coaches.  Can you please stop being so one-sided?  I don't know who hurt your butt tonight but it's showing.
yata9arasu::It sure would have helped the Cavs tank if they would have drafted Jonas though....  Lol....  Just saying.
Chris287907::if the Cavs lose and the Kings and Hornets win we will finish with the 3rd worst record. Which hopefully we could atleast get #3 overall and draft MKG
yata9arasu:::)  We already have the tie break so the Cavs only have to lose to clinch it.  Or all 3 teams lose.
RaptorsJaysGiants::THX FOR HIM :)
mikeyp2307::we didnt give you him
Alex818728::raptor troll you realize youve been here for hours?
mikeyp2307::how in the hell am i the delusional one?
mikeyp2307::i never said that
Alex818728::its not if they wanted to tank he wouldnt have played all week, they prob didnt want to re aggrevate his injury, maybe it hurt, also why not use this time to evaluate your young players
RaptorsJaysGiants::u said playing kyrie 9 mins isn't tanking lmfao
mikeyp2307::hes on canadian time.
mikeyp2307::BOOM
Alex818728::how am I delusional? your making assumptions without watching the game
Steven57928::Your the more delusional one.  if our team has tanked so hard and they only have one less win than your team then what does that say about the raptors who according to you have been going 100%?
RaptorsJaysGiants::not trolling stating facts its hard for you to believe me cuz ur delusional like those dumba.ss knick fans
markhud712::And the raptors are a none factor a nba team in canada is not marketable in the US sorry
markhud712::you could be the largest city doesnt matter and cleveland sports has a college feel @ the games
420floyd::and a feel for losing in all sports
markhud712::and they wont be relevant even with a star player who cares
mikeyp2307::he said you guys arent relevant, not city size
RaptorsJaysGiants::Toronto 4th largest city in NA and is way better then Cle u try to hard but fail at trolling
johnAllingham::true for the most part
Alex818728::hard to say because theyve never been relevant
johnAllingham::ya but 35 million people behind one team, no american team has that kind of following.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Toronto is more marketable then Cleveland
Chris287907::so if the bobcats lose their final fame and then start next season 0-4 the cavs will no longer have the longest losing streak in history
