Geektos::WHERE IS MARCUS THORNTON? AND CARLO IS G**
supe540::What's the Bucks record since picking up Monta?
packersfanfrom89::7-4
Gt_jackets89::Favorable schedule for the Bucks from here, our only tough game in the next 5 is against OKC, and we get them at home. I like our chances :)
ppokie23::kobe has as many air balls in crunch time as makes.... and he's clutch...? haha GO BUCKS full article here http://bustasports.com/
lmssports::ya kobe's overrated i hate spammers but that sites pretty good
Oaktown1029::Udoh - 21 minutes, 15 pts, 8 boards - nice!
Goon5832::Ok guys im lost how do you bet theses games over and under I wanna play any comments
KingGeorge53::Might as well get a divorce now.  Hire a body guard for when the bookies bring some muscle on unpaid balances owed.  Have a one way ticket to an unknown destination in case #2 doesn't pan out.
Miller Park After Dark::play leuer!
ferchinc::Brandon Jennings had a great overall game today. Him and Monta Ellis along with Mike Dunleavy shooting the ball extremely well, Milwaukee has become a contender team in the east. The Knicks have the Pacers, Magic, and Chicago despite the beatdown the Knicks put on the Magic last wednesday have a tough schedule. The Bucks next three games are Cleveland, Portland, and Charlotte who are all struggling this season and below .500. All I'm saying is by the end of the week, Bucks will retain the 8th spot in the eastern conference. I believe they will finish the season at a 6th of 7th spot.
WiscoMase23::bucks will not beat indiana. we will get slaughtered on the boards. the 8th seed is the only possible playoff spot at this point. however, i do like our chances for that.
nbapro15::Losing to Memphis on Saturday did hurt though after being up for most of the game, that's the Bucks, maintaining consistency throughout the game, if they have one or two bad quarters, they usually come up shot
nbapro15::The Bucks are retaliating after missing the playoffs last year
buckspackers23::7th spot maybe, 6th spot is out of reach, i believe. Unless we miraculously go undefeated or 13-1 the rest of the way
nbapro15::Boston and Indiana I'm not worried about, OKC I believe can be an easy 10 to 15 point loss. Kevin Durant dropping 40 and and Westbrook having around 30. Although within a week or two, Boston was a 7th seed now they're a 4th seed. Ronjo has been playing tremendous basketball and they are really starting to play and contribute like the championship 2009 team. Rondo has 5-triple doubles, Pierce has been shooting the ball consistently and KG is the beast on the boards and has taken a big advantage converting at the charity strike.
buckspackers23::I understand that. But OKC, Boston, and 2 versus Indiana.
nbapro15::Bucks have the easiest schedule through the rest of the season
kozanski2000::DC doing exactly what they have to do. Give themselves a big shot at Davis, and at the very least, to walk away from the draft with either Kidd-Gilchrist or Robinson. Have to get one of those first three picks. the team will be a whole lot of different with a second star for Wall to pass the ball to.

PLJosh86::When someone has to say "I told you so", it usually means they don't win very much.
