Leap_JRH::Meow... Meow... MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOW!
58rhodes::this road trip will tell the tale
Leap_JRH::Meow... (circling the food dish)... Meow.... (still circling...).... MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOW!
Zarlbane28::Nate needs to learn to play Elliot Williams more then 7 mins a game.
ballerbooboo::play him so he can miss more fts....
Kobelies247::Wont save this fail season but yes he should....
apodpora12::This is the season turning point for the Blazers.
JimboNoyes::omg you are soooo wrong. i cant wait to laugh in your face
Kobelies247::Ya, its gets worse...
jrey216::this light at the end of the tunnel $@%! is redundant. yeah n greg odom will be back if we make the playoffs
ViciousAthlete::LOL
jrey216::bill walton n lionel hollins n the late mo lucas r not in uniform anymore
Kobelies247::I love how blazer fans keep bringing up OLD wins against good teams LOL like it matters now!  Pathetic
tdawg44446::What else do you expect? The blazers suck this year
BlazerSully::only smart thing you've ever said on here.
Kobelies247::Hornets lost their best player as well if you forgot lol  Blazers are full with very good players!
tdawg44446::The hornets gave up before the season started, I don't know what you're talking about.   You're probably right about the blazers giving up though.. They have been tough to watch lately.
Kobelies247::Atleast the hornets dont give up
tdawg44446::Considering they lost their best player last year, I'd consider last season a success.  And if we're a joke, then what are the hornets??
Kobelies247::No, they sucked last year! This team is a joke now....
jrey216::heard da blazers hung franchise tag on raymond fatman after his performance 2nite
jrey216::these blazer fans are freakin hilarious
Kobelies247::I know right?
Kobelies247::Good luck on this road trip Portland! You might win 1 game...
yabooboobearskate::BLAZERS STILL SUCK!!!
yabooboobearskate::They got beat by 13 in the 3rd and 10 in hte 4th, thats not good.  Basically they only played better than them  half the game.
OregonUniversity95::Wins a win
tdawg44446::They gave up when the game was already in hand. I'll take a 12 point win erryday.
tdawg44446::Yeah, but at least they proved they can still win games. I was worried that they lost the ability to even beat the hornets.
nycxrich::worse beat ever
nycxrich::he EFFED up Por 2H -4.5. Unfrickenbelievable
nycxrich::FN Eliot Williams!!!!!
yanksoverthesox11::FU CK YOU BLAZERS GIVING UP 9PTS IN THE LAST MINUTE
OregonLou::gamblers are stupid !  ha ha ha !!  Here....I have a site where you can give me your money for free !  www.gambleyourmoneyawayforfreetome.com !  Ha haha ahahasdlfasasjasa'!!!
tdawg44446::I'm pretty sure they did that just to $@%! off some gamblers haha
Brians-Baseball::$@%!$@% gerald wallace couldnt cover his over of 13.5 points. thats not even a high bar to hurdle
J870065::Good win for the Blazers, although ending the game giving up the final nine points isn't exactly a way to build momentum for the next one. Assuming there not exactly a deep team with that type of effort from there bench.
JimboNoyes::they would watch Portland winterhawks hockey. cause mls is a joke
OregonLou::What everyone needs to realize is that this is just entertainment.    It's just a game.  Save your money.  I wonder what would happen if the NBA was gone. Dissolved.  Poof !  Gone !   Anyone???
J870065::If you think a win is a win then your an idiot &amp; you know nothing about sports, life, or anything inbetween. Get a clue loser. Portland loses by 15 there next game, &amp; the final two minutes of this game will have something to do with it.
blazers2189::another i.diot!
Kobelies247::Their
Kobelies247::lol
