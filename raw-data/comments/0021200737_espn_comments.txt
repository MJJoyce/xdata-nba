DWoe23::Cant wait for the Pacers game tonight. Its time to see where both contenders match up..
DWoe23::Rudy may not be the super star that PG can become, but at least the Raptors finally got a clutch shooter.
hoops 112hoping::calm down on Rudy Gay people 23 points on 25 shots while his matchup had 26 on 19 shots. That being said, George &gt; Gay but still Gay is not an elite player.
Spleefay::Pj is a great player, no one can deny that but Rudy is just as good or better right now. Lets see how he does when granger gets back. Can pj be great for many years?  Probably but he hasn't proved it yet
This_Guy1::But he balls out 2K though, he <b>HAS</b> to be good in real life! I mean 23 points!  - Rudy Gay lovers
Dirty-Diaper::Rudy Gay, is a ball hog.
loochey03::Tyler is a complete goon, he should be suspended.for his play on the more talented rookie from toronto (Jonas). he outplayed and and outclassed him.
Pacersfan4ever::Please Jonas is just a bigger version of Tyler. He was pushing our bigs left and righg, and the play Tyler threw him down was when Tyler was just standing there and Jonas tried to run thru him. I like both guys tho js
Spleefay::Hard fouling is one thing but to blatantly throw a player to the groung is ridiculous.  Hans is a $@%!$@ bag if I ever seen one. What if Jonas got injured again. The nba better fine or suspend this scrub. Ill tell u one thing tho, if this happened to lebron it would b the headline all over the nba
Demon Belly::Why is he a goon?  Because he scraps and hustles?  So Valanciunas is more talented, do you think Tyler is going to relent because he is outclassed?  If you do then you don't know Hans bro.
loochey03::typing
loochey03::typing in the dark , sorry.
loochey03::JOnas V killed on the boards tonight...He scored plenty. He should play over A gray.
terreldavis112::He's just coming back from injury. Gray is only starting because Andrea and Jonas both had big injuries but either of them will start within a week.
flag_me_if_you_can::he will
HEAT ARE GARBAGE.::Paul George is a beast. Wish he would be on my Bulls.  A rising star. Only Caramelo, LeBron and KD better at small forward than PG.
19brom::what was that? on your balls?
terreldavis112::I think it Gallinari is either at his level or better, offensively at least.
DBrownDrose::wow fake bulls fan
sandylamy83::he trained with lebron in the off season
hoops 112hoping::always knew Bulls fans wanted PG
__SPURS21::Rudy Gay&gt;&gt; Paul Goerge
Smashing Dweebs::Hibbert didn't put up any real points or rebounds, but you can't ignore 5 blocks...
Chi_Town_Everything::How does Hibbert  play 38 minutes and only get 3 rebounds?
mmosier10::pg
Deaneer32::$@%!!n Hicks man...
DWoe23::yea we may be hicks, but we have nothing else better to do than to study and know more about the game of basketball than the pretender fans do.
danes1212::Rudy...Rudy...Rudy
DBrownDrose::to be honest rudy gay&gt;paul george
tomy1022::sorry, i didnt know the pacer won last night lol  and gay was more clutch than george was last night. pacer resorted to using west down the stretch more so than george, while gay has to carry the scoring in the 4th.  i guess, people here are all stats-warrior. not saying which player is better overall, but gay was the better player in last night's game
Pacersfan4ever::Lmao Pacers gave the game away man, did u even watchthe game? And Rudy Gay was xlutch becuz who else is Toronto going to give it too?
hoops 112hoping::lol 23 points on 25 shots against 26 points on 19 shots? Look at the stats this year!! Ignorance at its best
Jumeax::yeah Gay is much better than Paul George&lt; except for...  shooting,  3P shooting,  FT Shooting, Rebounidng, Passing,  Defence and generally playing basketball  but Gay  has a fraction less turnovers per game but Gay is shorter,  much older and all remaining upside has evaporated
masterjoe712::Paul George is a significantly better 3 point shooter and defender
Coffin_Filla::duh
iownamicrowave::ur not being honest
DBrownDrose::i am
Jrunes520::Hey remember when we were up 2-1 on the heat.  #graspingatstraws
Demon Belly::As if that were something to be ashamed of.  How many teams in the East could put themselves in position to beat the Heat in the playoffs?  Certainly not the Raptors.
MasterOfLogic::If you're going to go by regular season, we beat the Heat by double-digits twice.
terreldavis112::In two games against the Heat this season the Raptors have played very close to Miami up until the last few minutes. The first game went to OT IN Miami.
MoneyWeems2477::Alan Anderson 4 minutes 1 shot-exactly how it should be
MoneyWeems2477::I really need to change my name
MoneyWeems2477::raptors days of 4th quarter failures are (hopefully) over
CamOverRG3::Pacers vs Raptors at home - 0-2  vs rest of NBA at home - 20-2
CamOverRG3::Rudy Gay hits a game winner that counts this time against Pacers
mackfactor::If Hibbert even came close to playing up to his contract this year, the Pacers would be up with the Heat and Knicks. 6 points and 3 boards?! Are you kidding me?!
mdizzle321::Pacers Suck!!! What a bunch of losers!!!!
DWoe23::last i checked, they aren't losing as much as the raptors if you look at the regular season as a whole. Raptors beat us, so what, Pacers will come out tonight tougher and even hungrier to beat the Nets. But hey Toronto good luck in the playoffs this year....
austin_0520::Bon nuit tout le monde (sauf Duke). Je vais dormir.
austin_0520::By the way, Duke, that's what a little bit of beginner French will do for you. I learned most of that in my French 1 class in high school.
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::ciao negs !!

austin_0520::You really do tell me stuff I didn't know about myself yet!  Please continue.  I might found out something useful!
austin_0520::The problem is you, and everyone will agree with that.
EoaRider::raptors rule refs always fck us
arguy1975::Oh Dukie...haven't you been beaten enough tonight?  I have to give you credit though.  Not one spelling error in that sentence.  First for you tonight bud.
rk6326::First and last.
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::bring it on h0m0s :)
arguy1975::actually no.  Rudy Gay does though
rk6326::This isn't twitter Duke.

austin_0520::I didn't like my own post, but I will now just to $@%! you off.
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::Oh  and an admitted Pedo@ AJe356
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::Nothing much jjust a few sack of garbage ( rk6326 ) looking for attention
austin_0520::Nothing much just a sack of garbage (Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns) looking for attention  ^I fixed it for you.
rk6326::He called me garbage. That's funny.
AJE356::this board turned into a hate war against one person
rk6326::Someone let a 13 year old (Duke) use a computer.
austin_0520::I think you're giving him too much credit.
AJE356::@Duke - You're a fucking idiot; calling people queer you've never met. You may as well just take your drunk ass down to your local bar and get yourself killed you fucking faggot
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::AJE356 usually people as yourself who cry out for attention to diverse attention on to them are usally sadistic monsters which i bet u are
austin_0520::I think that it's really ironic that you need to tell someone else that.
AJE356::whatever; you're too stupid to comprehend
arguy1975::Gearbox? Suck an egg.  This is Richie Cunningham, isn't it?
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::LMAO i cop out i am looking for fonzie
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::Flagged again AJE356
AJE356::just letting you know what you are.
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::At last check this was still called ESPN and not Austin_0520 board go suck an egg !!
rk6326::Not pretty sure...100% sure.
austin_0520::I'm pretty sure that everyone here doesn't want to hear another word from you.
arguy1975::Knicks fan for sure.
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::Flagged !!
AJE356::That's why your a faggot; calling people a pedo; how do you know some people on here aren't children. You probably are based on the amount of stupidity you've been spewing.
austin_0520::You've said that you were going to leave about 5 times now.  Please do us all of us a favor and leave now.
rk6326::Hey watch the language. His goal is to make you mad.
Kev_010::how can boozer help the raptors?
OJ McCoy::...by rebounding and not being Bargnani...
Braktooth::He can't. He might snow ownership into thinking Colangelo knows what he is doing though, and that's the point.
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::Well shift is over , laterz lardasses gotta run and Pacers &amp; Raptors u both suck neither one of you lame teams are making it past the 1 st round !!
arguy1975::whoever guessed Macdonalds, you nailed that.
austin_0520::Thanks for finally admitting that you're not a Pacers fan.  You were making the civil ones of us look bad.
YogaBeer::Cavs, Wiz and Raptors back in the PO next season?
arguy1975::they will be next year (Raps) 1 trade away from being competitive nightly.
arguy1975::Im sow soory Pacer fanns. I actd inproperlly toonight.

Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::that awkward moment comes when no one will let me suck their weiner   ~arguy1975
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::Hahahahahaha it does to that gearbox
arguy1975::whats a weiner?  wow.
AJE356::wtf, that doesn't even make sense
Hard Work Over Talent::"It's Rudy Gay.  No, not this guy!"  - Pacer fans
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::this guy is sick ?? he just posted this @      rk6326   Serious question. Any of you  under 13 years of age?
rk6326::How is that sick? I want to know if your stupid posts are a result of your age.
arguy1975::actually he just wanted to justify your stupidity level
austin_0520::You're right.  He should have put under 10 years of age at most.
arguy1975::that awkward moment when the entire board turns on you.
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::AJE356 = Most wanted on FBI List he changes identity often he is wanted for stalking in bedroom windows ! i for one am not surprised !!
rk6326::Duke: Serious question. Are you over or under 13 years of age?

austin_0520::I need to talk to more people like you Duke!  They can tell me things about myself that I didn't even know!
AJE356::Your sister told you no?
MasterOfLogic::...and there's the self-like.
rk6326::If anyone likes this...they have no sense of comedic talent.
rjb9rc::How drunk are you?
rjb9rc::Honestly, if all holds and the Pacers get the 3 seed and play the Hawks, I would be happy....getting Miami in the second round again would be awesome.
MasterOfLogic::ECF, Miami remains #1 seed.
austin_0520::If everything holds, the Pacers wouldn't play the Heat until the ECF.
rjb9rc::there it is.  thanks.
MasterOfLogic::1 8 winners play the 4 5 winners 2 7 winners play the 3 6 winners
austin_0520::The 1 vs. 8 winner plays the 4 vs. 5 winner.
rjb9rc::i thought the 1 8 winners played the 3 6 winners?  Not true?  They play the 2 7 winners?
AJE356::Duke; you're making Americans look bad.
arguy1975::just think about how Duke university feels.
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::Yeah ask anyone who really cares u queer?  i am off to get me some pusssy. on that note enjoy your pedophile net porn u piece of crap :)
austin_0520::You leaving is the most enjoyable thing that has happened all night.
AJE356::have fun with your sister
rk6326::Jerry Sandusky is more popular than Duke right now.
Rigstrikesbak3278::Toronto &gt; Indianapolis what a garbage city full of hicks
drstravinsky::I'm not gonna diss Indiana since I've never been there. But who gives a crap? This board is about sports, not real estate.
arguy1975::or do you only know 2?
arguy1975::which 2?
rjb9rc::c'est claire
arguy1975::you forgot Vancouver, Calgary, Victoria is beautiful....You need to get up here mon ami
rjb9rc::Montreal is nice.  I've only visited Toronto and Montreal...I've heard good things about Quebec in general though...
rk6326::Arguy: If you don't like this I will forgive you.
rjb9rc::Also, Canada....I mean....Canada....congrats, you have two cool cities in your entire f ing country....
arguy1975::woah...I didn't even say Edmonton and I live here.  Good job.
austin_0520::I'm sorry, but they have way more than two.  Vancouver, Edmonton, Montreal, and Quebec are four that I came up with easily off of the top of my head.  That's with living in Indiana.
rjb9rc::Toronto is better....but Indy is not a garbage city full of hicks....have you been to Indianapolis?
MasterOfLogic::F.uck the NBA... 4 games in 5 nights is ludicrous... it just cost us a game.
rjb9rc::Agreed....
drstravinsky::Wow, Duke you are still here laughing at your own jokes and being a doofus. Good way to spend your Friday night bud.
arguy1975::its early...still lots of time to impregnate his cousin.
drstravinsky::Slow night at McDonalds.
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::It is very slow come order a burger i am one burger away from employee of the month !
Duke_canot_be_trusted_to_bet_on_these_clowns::Not bad i know i am at work laughing at Canadian trolls getting paid for it , no complaining from me,  wife has cooked up a good steak for me :D
rjb9rc::Pacers choked.  4 games in 5 days will do that to a team.....oh well, good home win streak....and this will be fuel....when does Granger return again?
rjb9rc::If Lebron and Wade are A+ and A players, Granger is a B to B+, and you don't want to just give that away.  If the Pacers go deep in the playoffs, it will be because of timely shots from Granger when the offense stagnates...
rjb9rc::Not me....he is a trade asset, I suppose, but he has been the reason why the Pacers have made the playoffs the past few years....
Flash Barrett::Before the season and last year I thought all Pacer fans wanted Granger traded?
