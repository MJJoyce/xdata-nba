Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Yes.. just wanted to left that out there... bye.... you are not so bad Mr. Sage..or Rage.. bye
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Better to Choke duirng playoffs than to choke in the finals after being up a game or 2 don't you think?????????????????????  Ask Lebron he'll tell you.
nba is the worst::ask heat fans why they're so often wrong ('melo '09 WCF)
ButtaSports::ask carmelo why he never gets out of first round of playoffs

Heat_Master_Sage::sure.. let me get on my not a chance in hell shirt
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Alright man............... let's do this.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::I knew it eventually you would too :)   You wanna go to a game.... i got tickets.
Heat_Master_Sage::haha celtic fans we agree on the knicks ego
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::The above statement make me think otherwise :(
Heat_Master_Sage::I'm not hating on the knicks
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::and I'm back... told you it was gonna be before you knew it... why you hating on Knicks all the sudden bro?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Well.... it's been a vey productive day here with my favorite Heat fans....  However I'm saddened  to announce that I must be going now... but I'll most likely be back before you know it. You all take care and please tune in to see the Knicks beat the Nets tonight.....
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Soo............ back to basketball...................................... Knicks Number 1
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::then shut it.
What did I do is back and no one can stop him 4::The Bulls disagree...
What did I do is back and no one can stop him 4::No
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::You a Bulls fan?
Heat_Master_Sage::Aicyla = Webster now
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::here we go again.. You all should make a song called living in the past.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::and we would still beat  you
What did I do is back and no one can stop him 4::How'd that work in the playoffs last year?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Rondo stinks.
What did I do is back and no one can stop him 4::He'd be the 2nd best player on the Knicks.
Aicyla22::what? i am so confuded by all of this.  I must be getting old, ill be right back.
Heat_Master_Sage::knicks_fan = you. :P
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::HUH?????????????????
What did I do is back and no one can stop him 4::I wear Knickerbockers.... All day errey day.
Heat_Master_Sage::they need to play jorts
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::then that's awesome that I had no Idea what that even was.
Aicyla22::Jorts   Jean shorts. Worn mostly by children and $@%!$@%!$@. Jorts are perhaps the easiest way to recognize people you will not like. If you wear jorts, you probably don't talk to girls. The term "jorts" does not apply to jean shorts worn by black people, as those are entirely acceptable.  ________________________________________________________ haha great definition
Aicyla22::do.uc.he bags**
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::what she said.
Aicyla22::what?
Heat_Master_Sage::Lol jeezus knicks_fan
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::NOW WHAT DID WE DO THIS TIME?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Aicyla22 - i dont like anything knick labeled so its all good ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Have you tried "knick" labeled?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::you said you dont like anything knick labeled... my question is... how do you know if you haven't tried it?
Aicyla22::good question, still not interested
Aicyla22::what?
What did I do is back and no one can stop him 4::Why is Battier on the bench?
RunTheBall22__::thats where they keep the crappy players
Heat_Master_Sage::spark off the bench with cole
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Aicyla22 - wow i cant believe im saying this but i agree ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  yes.. we seemed to agree on something.. this could be the start of something great Aicyla
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::I'll grown on you.. you'll see..
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Of course.. it is working?
Aicyla22::no
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Aicyla.. I'll talk bad about Rondo... all you want.
Aicyla22::are u trying to sweet talk me?
RunTheBall22__::chalk up another stalker for this girl, if you do half as good in real life as on line you would be pretty popular. even for a heat fan
Aicyla22::im doing just fine in real life
Aicyla22::no i dont think so
Aicyla22::i dont like anything knick labeled so its all good
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Come on!!! I'm trying to at least like something "HEAT" labeled...
What did I do is back and no one can stop him 4::Bobcats back to the "Win 7 and stop!" strategy.
Heat_Master_Sage::Lol I agree run, that was funny
01Bulls4life::I think Noah has matured a lot.. .I must admit in the beginning I felt i had to like him because I'm a Bulls fan but hated to see how he acted sometimes.  However he has seemed to grow a lot but in character and in his game.  He brings so much energy and works super hard.
Aicyla22::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgTTMJ862UY  good D, but utlimately I like the first comment which is why i posted this
Heat_Master_Sage::$@%! we're agreeing with knicks_fan. x_x the world is ending
Aicyla22::as long as hes talking bad about ronda im okay with that
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::OMG Tonight at midnight!!!
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Is it Dec 12???? UUfff... that was close.
Heat_Master_Sage::only thing I'll agree with you on knicks_fan  rondo is the biggest punk in the nba
Heat_Master_Sage::I can't find the article anymore. but I believe he called duncan overrated. it's been a few years
RunTheBall22__::hmmm, well that is kinda bad but they don't pay the man to be nice. i liked when he made fun of Cleveland, that was funny
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Yeah.. what did that bun haired man say to Duncan?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Done with my drink back to war with you.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::I'll drink to that.
RunTheBall22__::so what did Noah say about the all mighty Duncan?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Hey Acicyla.. you are pretty nice looking........ever considered being a Knicks girl?
Heat_Master_Sage::she would have to be a man to be a knicks girl
Heat_Master_Sage::Noah is one of my least favorite players he disrespected tim duncan
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::At least Noah aint no Rondo...
Aicyla22::wow i cant believe im saying this but i agree
Heat_Master_Sage::Duncan is one of the classiest basketball players in the last decade, you never hear him shoot his mouth off
RunTheBall22__::you don't like Noah but not because of any basketball reason. sounds about right from a heat fan. and Duncan is not god
Aicyla22::i dont like noah bc he went to UF and it makes me sad that UD and Mike went there too ;(
RunTheBall22__::well thats just swell for Tim, but Noah is a different person if you didn't notice
RunTheBall22__::so what did he say?
Aicyla22::i agree, but for me it begins with his college affiliation
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::So.. am I loved or hated?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Wow.. I wasn't expecting that !!! I'm blown away.............. Not sure if I like it or not.
Heat_Master_Sage::I think people just find your annoying lol
Heat_Master_Sage::Knicks_Fan_Since_Today - *you  I stand by my statement without the change!
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::*you
Aicyla22::neither
Heat_Master_Sage::Knicks_fan you seem awfully obessed with the heat for some reason
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Becasue you are my favorite fans in the whole world.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Aicyla22 - who's noah? --------------------------------  Ha ha ha.. I almost forgot.. The Heat don't have this position. He is one of the best centers in the league..
Heat_Master_Sage::I thought it was a reject from the house of horrors
Aicyla22::u thought right
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Well... with you no one really knows.
Aicyla22::did you know ES?
Aicyla22::aw isnt that cute you really thought i was serious didnt you?
RunTheBall22__::FACT-- Kincks are better then the heat--FACT. there this ends it. these are fact people it says so right there. you can not argue fact.  now lets get back to talking about how Noah is now the best center in the NBA
Heat_Master_Sage::man those chumps need to remove themselves from the 1970's
Aicyla22::http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/$(KGrHqF,!i0F!j-0uelpBQURWcNilw~~60_35.JPG
Heat_Master_Sage::what the hell is a knick anyways
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::A Knick is what beat the heat.
Aicyla22::a pair of pants
Heat_Master_Sage::so if miami beats the knicks the next two times and both teams finish 2-2. who's better?
RunTheBall22__::then it goes to an overtime shoot out
Aicyla22::who's noah?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Amen... Thank  you.  Yeah.. that crazy MF is having a heck of a year...  I hate him.. but have to admit I'd love him on my team.
Heat_Master_Sage::So knicks fan, let me ask you something when a team dominates another team in the regular season then loses in the playoff time.  what matters more. the regular season or playoff?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::When the Knicks send home the heat.. that's what's gonna matter most.
Heat_Master_Sage::OMG YOU FINALLY SEE THE LIGHT   now shut up x_x
Aicyla22::regular season
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::I love to get the Heat fans all worked up.... Thruth do some crazy things to people.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Wow... that really hurt my feelings... can we make up ... and make out?
Aicyla22::opinions*
Aicyla22::everytime i think of the knicks i think "what a bunch of losers".
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Everytime I see a * I think of the 2012 NBA Chumps
Heat_Master_Sage::I'm sorry knicks fan ,I didn't know the nba adopted the bcs when how many points you win a game by matters. ooh woe is me
Heat_Master_Sage::lame, you're the only one living in la la land, using a stat to determine  who's going to win in the playoffs
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::But you sure like to live in a Fantasy heat fans.... ha ha ha ha.
Heat_Master_Sage::oh right to stat people, sorry this isn't fanatasy basketball
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Well they do have a stat on each team called points for and points against... So apparently it matters somewhere down the line....
Heat_Master_Sage::btw knicks fan you're right. RIP WOULD OF MATTERED
Heat_Master_Sage::I agree my point to Knicks continue to falls under the same princple wait until the damn playoffs before thinking your team is going to beat miami
Heat_Master_Sage::THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS RIP FROM TWO YEARS AGO $@%! for brains   jeezus how  stupid do you want to be today? first you think regular season matters when this isn't the bcs and there is a thing called the playoffs and second you can't seem to grasp the fact the major difference between two years ago to last year is RIP
RunTheBall22__::wasn't the only difference, another year for a young team to grow and improve is big. they were far better then two years ago. just a shame i tell ya, that would have been fun to watch
Heat_Master_Sage::so when miami defeated rose and noah two years ago. bull fans cried about sg. now that they had their sg you said it's not the difference? *head scratch*
RunTheBall22__::Rip would have made a difference, he did when he was playing. shame we didn't get to see that
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::2 years ago.... not last year... Point MADE!  And during that era.. Bulls defeated the Heat in the regular season by only a couple of points.  Those games could had gone either way.  Now tell me.. can you say that the last 2 games between the knicks and the heat could had gone either way?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::It wasn't just RIP moron.. the Bulls bench was as good as any other top teams starters.
Heat_Master_Sage::beat miami won the ring with bosh and wade being about 60-70 percent against the team that was supose to beat them in 5.   soo eh?
Heat_Master_Sage::bosh just came back from being out for nearly  two weeks and wade was injurid throughout the playoffs.  if you think both of them were 100 percent against the thunder you're smoking some messed up weed
RunTheBall22__::well if you can make up numbers then we all can, it's only fair
Heat_Master_Sage::RunTheBall22__ - Westbrook was only 74%  right...
RunTheBall22__::Westbrook was only 74%
RunTheBall22__::60- 70 %? so we just making up numbers now? KD was only 57%
Heat_Master_Sage::really seem to recall knick fans whining about injuries when they lost to miami and the celtics
Heat_Master_Sage::if Knicks can beat miami in the playoffs. THEN it matters right now knicks win? has the same weight as the wizards
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::No.. I just speak the THRUTH...  I provided that definition in case you get confused.
Aicyla22::providing the definition doesnt make your opinion the truth
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::delusional    suffering from or characterized by delusions. wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn
Aicyla22::cool so you've figured out your problem then, you're delusional
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::How is that an excuse???? tell me.... what team in the EC did the Heat played better than them during playoffs???? NONE..  They almost lost to the Celtics which were not match for the Bulls.. And you all missed the Bulls by fortune.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::right.... because they were fortunate enough that Rose and Noah got hurt and did not have to battle with them so all the teams the heat played the heat had the advantage.
Aicyla22::excuses? you knicks fans sure are good at those
Heat_Master_Sage::Okay, but my point is. Before  knick fans and trolls (( like runtheball) proclaim these two wins is going to matter  come playoff time is a joke. the moment the knicks and miami reach the playoffs that's when it starts
Aicyla22::I know I've said this before but regarding the playoffs i think the team going into the finals with the #2 seed has an advantage.
Heat_Master_Sage::Knicks_Fan_Since_Today - yes.. that's when it starts again... and the team with the better record during season has the advantange...  really? miami went to the finals twice being the number two seed
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::yes.. that's when it starts again... and the team with the better record during season has the advantange...
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Like I said...... the only team that trully has dominated the heat has been the knicks.. i know you are going to say last years teams beat us... but last years team that beat you were not near as dominant as the knicks.
Heat_Master_Sage::right... so what's the difference between the wizards winning and knicks winning? I'll wait.
RunTheBall22__::not really, but whatever makes you feel better
Heat_Master_Sage::celtics won 2-1, 3-1 against miami last year. all we heard is. OMG BOSTON'S DEFENSE is going to rip up miami
Heat_Master_Sage::Knicks_Fan. at the end of the day if Miami takes out the knicks come playoff time. the regular season victories the knicks have over miami means 0
Heat_Master_Sage::you're so stuck on the regualr season, is this because for the past 30 years the playoffs have sucked for you?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Of course.. Miami should just cancel the regular season and dress up during playoffs.
Heat_Master_Sage::jeezus  knick fans and their ego problems
Heat_Master_Sage::So the fact that miami beat the bulls and celtics who have beaten them. winning the regular season series against miami in the regular season doesn't matter?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Like I said... you missed the Bulls last year so we will never know until this year when/if you face the Knicks...
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::yes.. i understand what you are saying partially... but if you are referring to the Bulls.. well that 1st season during playoffs when Bulls won were games that could had gotten either way in the season, and last year the Heat did not have to deal with the Bulls (The only team capable of beating the Heat).  This years KNICKS have won 2 games Convincingly....  No one can say these games could had gone either way.. Knicks both games have dominated big.
RunTheBall22__::and the second game heat were pissed and gave 100%, they still got beat and with no melo
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::And are you sure that Miami will dominate the Knicks in the playoffs?
Heat_Master_Sage::I'm not sure of anything. all I know is  the fact any knick fans wants to use the regular season to any fact come playoff. need to go look at the last two years. of the teams that miami beat in the playoffs who beat them in the regular season
Heat_Master_Sage::on the message board for miami. two of your fans were so sure that knicks would just dominate miami in the playoffs. they shouldn't even show up!
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::where? where? I don't see it.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::How much more are the Heat disliked... well... a facebook page called  Miami Heat suck  has been liked 2423 times.  While a New York Knicks suck page has been liked only 26 times.  Wow...
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::cbbaseball19 - Knicks is looking from friends on facebook.

cbbaseball19::Patrick Tuttle celdicks wow where you come up with that. We dont whant ray were glad you took him. he cant play defence and rondo can shoot 3's. So talk smack about the celtics being bad but you sound pretty stupid beacuse last time i checked celtics have 17 champianships and miami has only has 2. mabe if you get 10 more then we'll talk. So how bout you get on the bandwagon and ride of this page. ---------------------------------------------------------  He just said Rondo can shoot 3's!!!!!!! LMAO
cbbaseball19::Not a chance I will be liking that page.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::I see you visited the page... now add me..
MiamiFan2004::Oh, well, on to the next game thread.
RunTheBall22__::better run
cbbaseball19::Knicks is looking for friends on facebook.  Hit him up everyone!
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::*For
cbbaseball19::Touche
MiamiFan2004::Josh Smith wins player of the week with the following numbers:			 min	pts	fgm	fga	%	reb	ast	blk	stl 145	85	32	70	.46	39	16	3	6 Meanwhile LeBron only went: 158	108	44	76	.59	35	33	2	10 LOL,  more eagerness to vote for anyone other than Lebron. 23 more points in 13 more minutes, shooting 13% better, doubling the assists and almost double the steals.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::and no Flops per game... now that deserves recognition.....
RunTheBall22__::we know Lebrons good, give some one else some credit, typical heat fan. who cares about player of the week anyway? lol
RunTheBall22__::i didn't argue the facts slick, but as far as player of the week is concerned they need to spread the wealth around a little. not like it matters anyway. only a lebron butt lover would give two craps about this. lol
MiamiFan2004::RunTheBall22__ - we know Lebrons good, give some one else some credit, typical heat fan. who cares about player of the week anyway? lol  You can't argue the facts, so you attack the messenger.  Typical troll.  Who cares about your weak opinion anyway? lol
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Hello???????
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Don't blame you... don't blame you... too many phycos out there..... most of them on the loose.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::But why make enemies when you can make friends?
cbbaseball19::I dont know. Just not gonna make friends through an ESPN chatboard lol
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::cbbaseball.. absolutely not you don't have a FB or not adding you as a friend?
cbbaseball19::The second part unfortunately lol
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::ok miamifan... you are picked....
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::NOooo... hey.. you have facebook?  Can I add you as a friend?
MiamiFan2004::ohhh pick me!
cbbaseball19::Absolutely not lol
cbbaseball19::Goodbye??????
cbbaseball19::Saints suspensions overturned! Suck it Goodell!
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::I wonder how much love or hate i've gathered with my fellow heat fans.
MiamiFan2004::neither.  It is all in fun.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Wake up people!!
cbbaseball19::Ive been awake!
MiamiFan2004::RunTheBall22__ - this is a new knicks team, different from last year so we can only go from what we have seen this year, and what have we seen from them so far? any heat fans want to take this one?  What have we seen from them so far?  Overconfidence, hype, ignoring their 5 losses while overinflating their wins, and outside of a couple of fluke wins against an unconcerned Heat, NOTHING of note against the rest of the top teams in the NBA.  When you lost by 28 to Houston, did that mean Houston became the NBA Champions?  When we beat Houston, did that mean we took it back from them?
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Maybe the Heat can ask Santa for some Defense this year.....
cbbaseball19::I think the defense has played better the last two games.  Santa might have come early this year.... ;)
Rambomonster9::http://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2011/9/24/2446337...    Lebron DOES have a good jumper you clowns. Kobe does not
RunTheBall22__::it's hard to jump with all those rings holding you down, thats a lot of weight
01Bulls4life::This board gets better and better every time i drop in to check it out.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::No....the Bulls back then won a title by playing basketball and showed it... There wouldn't be a need to discussed it on the internet.
MiamiFan2004::The joy of being title holders.  I bet the Bulls board would have rocked if they had won titles in the internet era.
