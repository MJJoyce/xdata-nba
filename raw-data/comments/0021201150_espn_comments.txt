This_Guy1::Well good game, Pistons.  5th seed, here we come!
RichardtheRabbit::ROSE IS DONE BRO! YOU THINK ROSE IS GONNA BE HAPPY ENDEN BRUH! REALLY! BRUH HE DUN! SHOULD BU BAC BE NOW BRUH! SHUMPERT SAME INJURY AND BACK ROSE NO BACK HENEVER GONNA BE SAME MAN
DjWeider::What language is that? Go to school
Chitowns17::Huh?!?! English "bro" or should I say "BRUH"
Tdavis2304::BK play good every 5 games he to inconsistent he needs a role change next year being 6th man..hopefully we get OJ mayo or somebody to start at SG plus at a starting SF
kdash3385::dirk &gt; BULLS'T  ashamed
msu for the win6::dirk &gt; Heat too
kdash3385::piston  under .500 &gt; BULLS'T  what a shame..
This_Guy1::lol still mad!
msu for the win6::shut up Heat poser
Rose will be Finals MVP::One star comes back and another star is out and injured, hope we get Deng back soon
Tim.Dwight::The Bulls don't have even 1 star right now.
2-3ZoneMakesGamesBoring::BULLS GARBAGE WITHOUT LUOL
Tehkiz::Miami's Streak - Check Piston's Streak - Check Knicks - Probably.
garnolfini::Melo, tho
Rasta Masta 33::Anyday now Rose, anyday please
Area55andG2::yeah I would feel the same way. It seems to be getting overkill, but if I were a Bulls fan, I would support him all the way through this process. I believe this season is a wash for the Bulls anyway
Rasta Masta 33::I feel bad for you guys as a small market team, even though we have a rivalry I do like the way you guys built your squad.  Pacers future is bright and I would root for you guys over Miami any day of the week
Area55andG2::It could actually force him to find other scoring options, which could improve his mid-range and perimeter game.   For the Pacers though, Granger's injury doesn't likely reap any hidden benefits to his game.
Rasta Masta 33::Yes and how he relys on his knees for his hops does concern me that he might regress a little bit.  I hope to God thats not the case
Area55andG2::I think his physical healing is all complete by now. The mental step is what he's working on. And I know that seems frivolous  to some fans, but it is legit. Especially considering how he plays the game.
Rasta Masta 33::I do support and will always love Rose, but Im starting to think that his recovery isnt as good as the media said it was.
Area55andG2::Only do to injury. The talent could be better, but the only reason the bulls are where they are at is because of injury
MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00::5 out of 4 people are bad at fractions...come on guys.
mromor::1/1 person named cwsox79 takes jokes, that aren't extremely funny, personally and doesn't realize he's the "dbag."
cwsox79::5 out of 4 people think you are a dbag
geeman217::I caught what you did right there..   I hope it ain't a typo....
MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00::nope
Area55andG2::A percentage is the top part of a fraction whose bottom part is 100.  http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~jenolive/percent1.html  .5% means .5 over 100, therefore 1 over 200
macksolo::ok. .5 % is 50% because .5 is 5 tenths meaning 5 over 10 the first space after a decimals the tenths place, the second is the hundredths meaning .05 would be 5 out of 100.
Rasta Masta 33::Ive been a fan since before Jordan was drafted, Ive seen the ups and downs.  I dont make fun of other teams cause of bad karma.   Hate to say it we're the 2nd worst fan base to do that. (Behind the heat of course)   Im one of few that know that we wont get past the 2nd round
Area55andG2::geeman217- thanks I guess. Same to you.
geeman217::Area55andG2 - no, no, no, no. We've caught the problem at the source. 1% is not the same as 1. _________________ 1% ? .1% or-  100%??? nevermind,...
Area55andG2::thanks Rasta, you want to talk basketball I'm definitely open to that.
Rasta Masta 33::Good luck to your team Area, I hope us or you guys take out the heat in the playoffs
Area55andG2::no, no, no, no. We've caught the problem at the source. 1% is not the same as 1.
geeman217::Area55andG2 - So half of 1% is .5%  .5% = 1/200.  I can't believe this is still being debated _____________ Dude you are sooo wrong.  But I admire you for sticking to your guns. Even if it makes you look stubborn and stupid(no offense) meant :)
Rasta Masta 33::He is right actually
geeman217::Area55andG2 - Here we go again. 1% is 1/100 is it not? _________________ LMAO!!! 1% writing it is 1.0  0 is the dividing line anything on the left of 0 is whole numbers. like 1, 2 3, 4  on the left(of )  is  percentages of numbers like-  .10 .50 .75 or .005
Area55andG2::So half of 1% is .5%  .5% = 1/200.  I can't believe this is still being debated
Area55andG2::Here we go again. 1% is 1/100 is it not?
geeman217::macksolo - Sorry Bro, I just could'nt help it ___________ It's cool  I'm kidding with you.  He's still think he's right???  un-belivable..
Area55andG2::the blatant ignorance continues, I guess
macksolo::Very true
macksolo::Sorry Bro, I just could'nt help it
Area55andG2::.5 = 50% however, .5% doesn't = 50%
geeman217::Man, why do you keep bailing him out???  I was enjoying him dig  himself in this hole
geeman217::LMAO &amp; SMDH....
Rasta Masta 33::Love my Bulls and loyal fans, but can't stand idiots like geeman
geeman217::Area55andG2 - funny how you change the topic. This is amusing. ___________________ YOU'RE The one who should be relishing it..  You are dead wrong my friend
Area55andG2::funny how you change the topic. This is amusing.
geeman217::Area55andG2 - This should be montaged. ______________ Go back to back slapping your Pacers for FINALLY putting up a banner. Next to those dusty ABA Banners.  They haven't dry-rotted yet have they?
Area55andG2::This should be montaged.
Area55andG2::earth shattering, I know
Dave Knows Best::Damn you, Derrick Rose. Coward.
Steelcity4384::Wow. Bulls are pathetic, no wonder Rose doesn't wanna come back.
Area55andG2::Bulls fans, are the Bulls going to resign Robinson?
Steelcity4384::Please tell me you aren't that stupid
Steelcity4384::You mean 1 for 200?
Area55andG2::notice any figure below where I added a "th" on the end? It is an honest mistake. I could care less if you believe me.
geeman217::Area55andG2 - I said 1/20 below, which legitimately was a typo on my part. I further explained you can't use the decimal point all willy-nilly, but you weren't buying it. Please get an education. ______________ you don't typo a figure like 1/20th...  Ok, Ok I'm gonna stop.  I'm cracking up over here....
Area55andG2::stop while you can dude. you are embarrassing yourself the more you speak about this
geeman217::Area55andG2 - Steelcity4384 - Percent means per hundred so if you put a decimal it makes it .5 per hundred.  If you need any more help in 5th grade math lemme know ______________ *whispering to the Pacer fan* it means 10ths...
Area55andG2::I said 1/20 below, which legitimately was a typo on my part. I further explained you can't use the decimal point all willy-nilly, but you weren't buying it. Please get an education.
Area55andG2::Steelcity4384 - Percent means per hundred so if you put a decimal it makes it .5 per hundred.  If you need any more help in 5th grade math lemme know
geeman217::LMAO!!!!
geeman217::We're waiting to see if he can shot .50% from the field first.  (Ta-he-he-he)
Area55andG2::steel, could you once again explain math?
geeman217::*Off Topic*  Skylar Diggins is hot!
knicks and heat will choke::i wouldn't mind D'ing her up
NGplayinskillz::Yeah she is hot for a women's basketball player but she is just average compared to non-basketball players.
macksolo::<b><i>True, nobody would pay attention to her that like if she wasn't in the limelight..</i></b>
geeman217::I saw  her in regular clothes.  Chick is hot.  You might be short.  I understand...
macksolo::<b><i>YES SHE IS!!!!!!</i></b>
DJamesRuhere::Why doesn't 2K13 let u play with injured players on online games? I should be able to run with D-Rose or Bynum or whoever....they gotta change that for next year's game
geeman217::go away kid
999_dsp::nope, not like LeBron.  LeBron is nailing shots all over the court now and the numbers prove it.  he's shooting over 40% from 3   so much for that theory.  Rose is TRASH.
This_Guy1::What's his TS%?
knicks and heat will choke::you're still crying about the bulls ending the refs 27 game win streak?
Area55andG2::Lebron's getting most of his points in the paint. If you were to criticize his offense it would be his mid-range shot
macksolo::<b><i>Lebron doesn't take many three pointers, but i'm sure you overlooked that stat.</i></b>
geeman217::ESPN DIRFCTED you here TOO-   I guess?  or are you just TROLLING...
DBrownDrose::yeah whatever
999_dsp::Derrick Blows would  struggle to shoot 40 % if not for layups.  he has NO game outside 5 feet from the hoop.  he bricks almost every shot badly.  rose is a horribly overrated player.
macksolo::<b><i>Half of LBJ shots are dunks and lay-ups. Your point?</i></b>
kevin711431::just like lebron lol
DJamesRuhere::I think the NBA is fixed in some ways...it's very odd how New Orleans got the first pick last year after they were struggling to find someone to buy team for so long...had to be some kind of under the table deal go on ....weird how D-Rose ended up in his home town and so did LBJ...If New Orleans gets the first pick again this year that would make me positive.....I don't like how the draft Lottery isn't even televised...that seems shady
mccoywajmu::The lottery isnt televised but 200 members of the media watch the live drawing of the lottery.  You really think if it was fixed that the media wouldnt be all over it?  I dont see stern risking federal charges for fixing a lottery just so New Orleans can get Anthony Davis.  And I dont see the owners being cool with Stern fixing the lottery either.
EastCoastSurfing::It's also weird when I flip a coin and it seems about 1/2 the time in lands heads up. gravity must have some sort of stake in the whole business. shady indeed.
kevin711431::or like chris paul was denied going to the lakers!
DJamesRuhere::exactly
kevin711431::true just realized that
999_dsp::he's VERY overrated.  all he does is ballhog and chuck up bricks while his team bails him out on defense, another facet of the game he is completely useless at.
kevin711431::he makes 45% of his shots   if the bulls take it into their own hand they turn the ball over every time
knicks and heat will choke::who's he?
kevin711431::true but thats what helps us win idiot
macksolo::<b><i>Guess that's why he led his team to the best record in the NBA two years straight , won ROY and an MVP. Yep, overrrated. </i></b>
laurasman::No news here...DROSE is a pus.sy
999_dsp::Derrick Rose is a overrated crybaby.
Area55andG2::nope. He's not overrated. crybaby is bit harsh too.
Area55andG2::do you think Derrick rose will get upset if the Pacers celebrate now that they won the central division?
kevin711431::pacers are small market they wont be allowed to beat the heat or advance deep in playoffs
Roberto201204::U THINK PACERS WILL EVER WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP
macksolo::<b><i>It will only serve as fuel...</i></b>
kevin711431::i like this better
DBrownDrose::honestly i dont think anybody cares
Area55andG2::He whined to reporters about the pacers celebrating after a win last year.
kevin711431::no he will just smirk and think  wow what if they get out of the second round what will they do then?
geeman217::DO you think George can shoot .50% again?  Maybe 35%  cause he's fading fast...
Steelcity4384::Percent means per hundred so if you put a decimal it makes it .5 per hundred.  If you need any more help in 5th grade math lemme know
Steelcity4384::Actually .50% is 1 in 200 you are both idiots
Area55andG2::It's a simple typo. Not realizing it is ignorant. It could make sense either way, you just weren't consistent with the decimal point. You my friend are the one that is wrong. Now let it go... LMAO!
geeman217::Area55andG2 - He made a clear differentiation between the 2 numbers. He used a decimal point in 1, and didn't use a decimal point in the other _______________ Give it up dude you were WRONG and doubled-down on your stupidity.  let it go....  lmao!
Area55andG2::He made a clear differentiation between the 2 numbers. He used a decimal point in 1, and didn't use a decimal point in the other
geeman217::macksolo - .05 is 5%,  .5 is 50% _____________ Awww  I wanted him to keep thinking he was right...  :(
macksolo::.05 is 5%,  .5 is 50%
Area55andG2::.50% is not 50%.
kevin711431::Area55andG2 - good math. to go .5% shooting you have to go 1/20  good grammar
geeman217::Area55andG2 - good math. to go .5% shooting you have to go 1/20  .50% is fifty percent my friend.  Try harder please...
Area55andG2::good math. to go .5% shooting you have to go 1/20
coltsman668845::PACERS WIN CENTRAL DIVISION!!!!
coltsman668845::It would seriously suck if they left in the first round with how good they are on defense. The pistons will be back, pro very soon, but for the first time since the brawl indiana is a great team
kevin711431::they have a good shot but who knows maybe the exit the first round or win the championship who knows
kevin711431::ok i like indiana better just why you gotta rub it in   i like the pacers they  are a good team but they go over the top with celebrating;(
coltsman668845::I have been too Detroit. its alright been i saw nothin to prove its better then indy
kevin711431::why cuz monkeys automatically means african americans?  i hate people who think like that $@%! them
coltsman668845::Well yea i was about to say....
kevin711431::and as in monkeys i dont mean blacks i mean animals who jump high and are athletic  im including whites in this no racist
kevin711431::i mean as a city   you know something that actually matters unlike a game with a bunch of big monkeys and a ball.
coltsman668845::And whats your logic in that i might ask?  48 - 26 wins
Area55andG2::I want to remain on good terms, but please you are embarrassing us by having the Heat and OKC on your favorite teams list
coltsman668845::U have a good point. I prob shouldnt have them
kevin711431::congrats indiana is worse than detroit thought
kevin711431::hey
DJamesRuhere::Enough with the Detroit is ghetto so players won't want to play here talk...That's like saying some parts of L.A are ghetto so players won't want to play for the Clippers...Oakland County is one of the richest counties in America...I myself live in Troy, MI which is located in Oakland County...the majority of the players live in Bloomfield Hills which is one of the wealthiest cities in America...BTW the Pistons play in Auburn Hills not Detroit...Auburn Hills is also a nice area...a lot of nice cities to live in Southeastern Michigan
kevin711431::i live in illiniois and own my own pizza shoppe
DJamesRuhere::what's it called?
kevin711431::suh is a bad person lol   stafford hahahahahhahahahahahhahahahah  prince feilder is fat  and calvin johnson is understandable since he is one of the greatest palyers
DJamesRuhere::Suh is on all sorts of commercials advertising all sorts of products...marketing opportunities here
kevin711431::no business oppurtunities either since most of detroit is poor.  unlless you wanna open a kfc
DJamesRuhere::lots of opportunities here outside of Detroit...where do u live just out of curiosity?
kevin711431::look at marketing oppurtunities   look at chicago with mj rose ditka urlacher etc
DJamesRuhere::look at Ndomkung Suh, Calvin Johnson, Stafford, Justin Verlander, Prince Fielder, etc. etc.
DBrownDrose::thats where im going
DBrownDrose::im looking at right now and it looks very nice, im surprised
DJamesRuhere::enjoy ur stay...don't be scarred...u have nothing to worry about....ur going to a very wealthy are...most homes cost around $400,000 in that area... a lot of million dollar homes too
macksolo::<b><i>Both Miami and New York are too dependent on three point shooting, stop the three, stop the streaks.</i></b>
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::Apparently, you don't watch the Heat or the Knicks. JR smith has gone to the basket more than he ever has in his life. One game he only shot 1 3 pointer and the Heat are always driiving to the basket.
macksolo::<b><i>Apparently I do. I watch basketball and know that those players that drive to the basket will continue to drive and score but when you limit those teams perimeter players, especially from behind the arc, those teams struggle. Try harder and watch basketball more and you will learn a thing or two. </i></b>
999_dsp::i'd be more scared of Shitcago, the murder capital of the world.
Lt. Dengerous::Bulls could've really used Luol in this one
geeman217::Deng could've really USED the rest...
DBrownDrose::im goint to detroit next week im very scared
DJamesRuhere::West Bloomfield is a beautiful city....very safe and wealthy area..u have nothing to worry about my friend
kevin711431::bring a gun
knicks and heat will choke::Detroit is the only city where you can still get polio
DJamesRuhere::what part?
DBrownDrose::west bloomfiled
kevin711431::i will pray for you my friend
DBrownDrose::thanks i'll probably need it
Philip3664::Good...
JrueRandallHoliday::As soon as Rose gets back, Boozer, Noah and Hinrich will return to the injured list...
999_dsp::the bulls best FA signing in the last decade  +  Carlos Loozer.  lol
geeman217::999_dsp - the bulls best FA signing in the last decade  +  Carlos Loozer. lol ____________ geeman217 - ESPN DIRECTED you here too RIGHT?  Lmao!  What a troll..
Mooseapug256::The bulls draft so good they dont need any FAs
999_dsp::drummond is the next dwight howard and only 19 years old  Loozer is absolute TRASH on the defensive end, he gets benched at critical moments of the game.
DBrownDrose::drunmonds is trash
DBrownDrose::are you mad that hes better than andere drums
JrueRandallHoliday::LOL!
The One and Only Lee Collier::With fair officiating:  Pacers &amp; Bulls &gt; Heat
macksolo::<b><i> May not be greater, but definitely puts Miami in a realistic view. </i></b>
macksolo::<b><i>I certainly agree, but the NBA has been the NBA for many years, MJ got his share of calls vs Reggie and Ewing so it evens out over time, Miami isn't invincible though. Those MJ Bulls were darn close...</i></b>
The One and Only Lee Collier::Let's be honest. In the playoffs, and leading up to them, that's where David Stern makes his money so the Heat will get every single call they want so that his team can win. In the regular season, the Pacers and Bulls both have winning records vs the Heat this year. Also both of our teams have had more than our fair share of games stolen (particularly by the Nuggets) from us this year so we're both better than our records indicate.
macksolo::<p> LOL Bulls will stop the Knicks streak Thursday.... </p>
DBrownDrose::i hope
DBrownDrose::true
macksolo::<b><i>Miami tried to do the same thing, they are both too dependent on three point shooting.</i></b>
DBrownDrose::yeah but the knicks are gonna jack up 3s untill they make them
macksolo::<b><i>The world didn't expect them to end the Heat's streak either...</i></b>
999_dsp::the pistons have a GREAT future with knight, drummond, monroe with a lottery pick and a ton of cap space  the bulls have a bunch of overrated, overpaid TRASH on their roster.  they have one of the worst futures of any team in the league.
Mooseapug256::true, the bulls are set except for a solid 2
Mooseapug256::Ha the bulls have rose noah butler gibson and a future 1st from the worst team in the league
DBrownDrose::dont forget mirotic the next nowitzki
999_dsp::facts &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your bitter opinion.
DBrownDrose::and no one wants to go to detroit
DBrownDrose::most of those players are probably gonna leave
999_dsp::jerebko OWNED the bulls today.
macksolo::<p style=""> This is crazy, weird Pistons' fans. </p>
Aint Bout Dis Life Friday Edition::damn bulls end miami's streak but lose to the pistons by 14.  what gives!
surfzone365::We'll end the Knicks streak
kevin711431::luckily the bulls have a future unlike the pistons.  charlie villanueva   stuckey   white guy jerebko?  knight sucks    and even if they draft someone who is a star they will just leave to chicago or miami cuz of the big market and cuz detroit has the worst ghettos in the world killings robbings and rape everywhere.
kevin711431::well boozer and deng are gone.  thats noah butler rose and two superstars in free agency   i think they have a bright future no?
Jrfusion08::Detroit is a horrible town... guess Chicago hasn't looked at their murder rate recently lol. As for futures, Detroit has 4 guys under 22 on their team. All of which have shown promise and dominated Chicago tonight. Chicago has an aging Deng and Boozer and a hesitant Rose. The only "future" player that is performing is Butler.
DJamesRuhere::ur making a mistake by saying they won't come here cus Detroit is ghetto...Oakland County is one of the richest counties in America...I myself live in Troy, MI which is located in Oakland County...the majority of the players live in Bloomfield Hills which is one of the wealthiest cities in America...BTW the Pistons play in Auburn Hills not Detroit...Auburn Hills is also a nice area...a lot of nice cities to live in Southeastern Michigan
kevin711431::chauncey was a beast for sure they all were  i loved rips mid range sucks he coudlnt do that with the bulls
kevin711431::im atalking about the future though not past   otherwise jordan is the greatest and six championships
kevin711431::hey same with chicago! i agree.  but chicago and the bulls are known worldwide all over europe.  especially cuz of jordan
DJamesRuhere::ur making a mistake by saying they won't come here cus Detroit is ghetto...Oakland County is one of the richest counties in America...I myself live in Troy, MI which is located in Oakland County...the majority of the players live in Bloomfield Hills which is one of the wealthiest cities in America...BTW the Pistons play in Auburn Hills not Detroit...Auburn Hills is also a nice area...a lot of nice cities to live in Southeastern Michigan
kevin711431::with rip ben wallace and tayshaun and rasheid no i remember well
DJamesRuhere::and Big Shot Billups...those were dominant teams
DJamesRuhere::u forget how dominant the Pistons were for about 8 years....won a championship and were one game away from winning another....selective memory I see
kevin711431::the pistons were chucking the whole game and were making   credit to them but doesnt mean they are better than the bulls
kevin711431::this was a fluke game all their shots were going in  the bucks beat the heat did you catch that game?  drummund is good but needs to work on his jumper
JrueRandallHoliday::Was a fluke how the bulls ended the Heats streak... today was evidence... beat the best lose to trash, LOL!
DJamesRuhere::I'm from Detroit and I agree with u...go to school at Wayne State and u wouldn't believe some of the homeless people around there....the Pistons future looks bright because of Andre Drummond...he looks like D-12 2.0
kevin711431::i will admit drummond is a good player. has a high ceiling
kevin711431::you traded away daye and tayshaun the only two good players  idiots hahahahahahahahaha
kevin711431::JrueRandallHoliday - Yeah, like the idiot bulls gave up Korver, Watson and Asik to keep Gibson, LOL!  due to the salary cap not cuz we are cheap and need a new airplane
JrueRandallHoliday::Yeah, like the idiot bulls gave up Korver, Watson and Asik to keep Gibson, LOL!
999_dsp::the funny thing is,   all of those players you listed kicked the crap out of the bulls
DBrownDrose::awkward moment when they be watching the bulls in the playoffs
Aint Bout Dis Life Friday Edition::drummond tho
JrueRandallHoliday::At least they play most of their games...
DBrownDrose::white guy has a first name you know
surfzone365::No ill-feelings vs the Pistons.  They were the better team tonight.  Congrats on breaking the streak, and good luck going forward.  Go Bulls!
999_dsp::Shitcago sucks as a city and all of their sports team suck every year.
Area55andG2::feel free to disagree with me, but I think the most important stat to take away from the regular season is how consistent a team is. The Bulls when healthy are a lot better than this, but they won't be healthy so this season is a wash.  The Knicks have been up and down regardless of injury.  The Pacers have been the most consistent team with injury or without it.
The One and Only Lee Collier::Man, I'm a Pacers fan and I can say we're all sort of up and down. The Knicks have really high highs and really low lows. The Pacers and Bulls are slightly more consistent because we both have players under age 40. The Bulls are hardly ever healthy, partially because they all are overplayed during the regular season. Paul George is kind of overplayed too. We'll see what happens in the post season. I'm looking forward to it
JrueRandallHoliday::The Bulls are rarely healthy, that's their biggest problem.
DJamesRuhere::no...what matters is who's playing the best around playoff time
Area55andG2::The Knicks aren't structured well enough to beat the Heat.
DBrownDrose::naahhhh
Area55andG2::see how I just made an argument? "naahhh" doesn't really counter it.
smbear66::Well they were unable to match the Jordan era 19 in row against the pistons in the 90's, but 18 in a row ain't bad.
DJamesRuhere::I don't understand why Dallas and Chicago r on TV so much....when's ESPN, TNT and NBATV gonna learn that nobody wants to watch Dallas or Chicago play on national TV....i'd honestly rather watch the Washington vs. Boston game...at least i'd get to see John Wall play
DBrownDrose::chicago is cool thats why
DBrownDrose::*cool
DJamesRuhere::u guys r good but boring without D. Rose
kevin711431::i like chicago
DJamesRuhere::they're boring
HAWKS_BULLS_BEARS_CUBS::Knick or Nets!  bring it on beetch!
999_dsp::the Pistons DESTROYED the horriBulls.
fightingillini2515::Come here when you guys win 30 games, and make the playoffs, and get a fan base
kevin711431::too bad the fans didnt help them.
Bears.Blackhawks.Whitesox.In.2013::Rose needs to just announce he's done this Year. He's acting like a attention $@%!$ right now seriously
kevin711431::plus he doesnt like attention he shys away from it.
JrueRandallHoliday::So he should, dude sheds to many tears...
kevin711431::how do you know   chances are slim but you never know
Bears.Blackhawks.Whitesox.In.2013::But he's not going too, So I won't
kevin711431::well you would look stupid if he does come back this year.
JrueRandallHoliday::Rose would look stupid if he comes back during the most intense basketball played during the year...  every other PG would eat his lunch and make him cry.
Redneck SEC Fan::lol the pistons snapped the streak
kevin711431::congrats redneck
