epochme::rose aint comin back for this, he will not be a lifer in chicago
hawaiianprince12::They're not that good w/out D-Rose? Even with Rose at 75% to 85% they would be way better than they are now!!
NJNets_100979::bulls are back!!!
sportsnu36::And all you other fans from other teams calling players from the Bulls garbage that don't deserve to be called that,S T F U!Noah is the 2nd or 3rd best center in the east.If you wanna call anyone garbage call the players that deserve it.Such as Rip,
sportsnu36::Lets face it my fello Bulls fans,from one Bulls fan to all others,maybe the Bulls shud just tank the rest of this season,Rose not comeback,get a high draft pick that can hopefully be a stud,get rid of old @$$ Rip.Because the way I see it the Bulls won't get to the ECF with that performance.You can't shooting 20% from the field.
Jordanbetonbasketball1990-1998::Too late to tank the season. They'd get that late first round pick. ANd I'm not sure if that was traded away at one point. They're still a playoff team. Just seems as though they're distracted with the Rose comeback stuff.
ThunderHornz::And who was the idiot that said OKC should get boozer before the deadline? Now do you see why we all laughed? Hard?
AllAboutBearsBulls::BULLS NOOOOOOOOOOOO
LetsPlayScRyB::noah is trash
Chi.Twn.Native::So is your mom.
tigel18::The Bulls need another star, and they know it.  We'll see what they do.  I'm just ready for DRose to come back so it's not so painful to watch the Bulls play.  It's flat out ugly when we play good teams right now.
4 Petes Sake::Bulls weren't hiring shots but Okc defense was pretty stout.
nba is the worst::Bulls slumping bigtime, couldn't hit wide open shots all game
BasilHussain::I think its fairly simple, the bulls are a good team right now but they are in no way elite. With Derrick out our offense is inept. Luol although a good player is unable to carry a team and isn't really a superstar. With Derrick back do we have enough to compete with the best teams in the league? Maybe but I'm of the opinoin that we need a true second option that can create their own shot. Luol couldn't even take Perkins to the rim in a iso situation.
no.37::people need to realize that the bulls just arent that good of a team. reggie rose is right.
epochme::in a very weak eastern conference, just good enough to never get any better...
polocash::not good enough to win it all
Derek2384::32-24 without D-Rose.... I think that's pretty good.
Da-THUN-Da::Why fisher?! He hasnt played all damn year
LosHeatSonLosMejores24::bulls, Lol!!!
kitastrophy34::Ronnie Brewer and Derek Fisher?  We should be molding with what we have, not a 38 year old defenseless point guard and a unwanted "defensive" player...
ThunderHornz::Love old posts! Anyone guess which one comes from a spurs dropping?  UTRAssassins - Bulls win big. -tpac_12 - Bulls got this 104-98 ScalabrineSwag - Bulls gonna win this.
ThunderHornz::He didn't need any against the sorry bulls!
kitastrophy34::29% shooting isn't gonna win anything, ScalabrineSwag, the same guy that said the Thunder have 0 Defense...
LetsPlayScRyB::durant has no defense
kitastrophy34::appreciate the 16 boards Boozer and Noah  -Durant
Lebroncouldcareless::DAMN SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LEBRON
1USAirForceVet::People that still think we should not amnesty Boozer after this year I hope were watching. Inflated regular season stats in pointless games against nobody means nothing. How do you play against the elite teams in critical games when we need you? Rose is out, Hinrich is out, Deng &amp; Noah are overworked &amp; we're playing the defending WC champs. We need you...   2 points?
1USAirForceVet::Stinks? Fighting for a #3 seed with our best player out the whole year?
01Bulls4life::Boozer is not the biggest problem... right now the whole team other than Noah stinks! This season is as well as over, I'm just hoping to see new faces next year, faces that indeed impact this team for the better and help out Rose.  Rose, for your own good..... don't come back yet.
01Bulls4life::Even if they amnesty Boozer the team still stinks!  I sure hope and pray next season this team has top quality players.
1USAirForceVet::He's A problem. He has never not ever once shown up when we needed him most &amp; we need better than that for what we're paying him. He's a good player. against garbage teams he pads stats but we're looking at titles &amp; he won't help us get there pulling vanishing acts in critical moments
wilcox1232::Rose needs to not come back this season. Take more time recover, because the rest of the teams tank is showing up pretty much at empty for the rest of the season
This_Guy1::Bulls fans, is it safe to say that we need Hinrich back? Because Robinson isn't doing s*** for us. Good game, Thunder, but we are slipping bad. I feel like it's a lack of hustle on our part.
wns9779::Neither is Hinrich.
1USAirForceVet::He's good but as a novelty... he's a fantastic guy to bring in for some quick buckets &amp; energy... he's NOT a starting pg
. Area Code 404 ATL .::If the standings in the East were to remain exactly how they are now: (1) Miami Vs. (8) Milwaukee / (2) Indiana Vs. (7) Boston / (3) New York Vs. (6) Chicago / (4) Brooklyn Vs. (5) Atlanta  .......those would all be some great series...even MIA Vs. MIL because the Bucks match up well against them.
wilcox1232::I really think toronto catchs the bucks for the 8th seed
PistolaRosada::Lol
heyman110::Am I the only one who likes Westbrook? I know he's kind of emotional at times but he's still extremely talented and he's still improving.
Lebroncouldcareless::YEP YOUR THE ONLY ONE,,,,,,,,,,,BUBBA!
FLIGHT ZERO::Fisher to sign with thunder? Good or bad I say bad because brooks will play him 15-20min and Sefolosha will lose minutes and Jackson will be out of rotation . Fisher shoots about 34fg%
tothewesttt::I personally liked Fisher, I feel like I caught myself over and over last season saying, "thats my boy fish!!" he was a great clutch player from the wing and his 3's we're always helpful in times of need
smokeysaj::The Bulls' shooting makes Kobe look good.
spaceicecream::Keep rehabbing Derrick.  Don't come back to this trash.  Reggie Rose's comments were not warranted but he's absolutely right.  With a notoriously cheap owner and two idiots running management I'd light a fire under their a$$es to get a functional team around Rose.  Until then, sit out as many games as you want, Kirk does.
4Pokes12::Wow.... How is Stephen A Smith Going to explain this one lol?
nviz::Chicago cannot play with big boys.
lance_baldwin_lbst::Westbrook could be the league's MVP if KD was not on his team. He could average 30 a night.

professional alcoholic 773::Nah, he died when his tour bus crashed.
professional alcoholic 773::Stop eating my sesame cake!
Viktor Karelin::well they did
Louis the III::nate robinson is the bulls best player right now
professional alcoholic 773::Nah, it's Jason Caffey
philweilert::OKC fans/players must have a lot of patience when dealing with Westbrook. He has a horrible attitude for a guy who has never won much, meaning awards and championships
RafaWoods01::Everybody does that though, people just like to complain I see.
philweilert::there was another time a couple of weeks ago when he left the court because he was mad at his teammates. that's uncalled for
Sweetwilly013::Trust me, it's frustrating. I've lost count of the amount of times he's just jacked the ball up at the beginning of the possession.
philweilert::its more how he acts for me. Like in the first quarter he went to the basket and it could have been called a foul but he just sat on the floor and watched the bulls go up the floor and his man went to the rim
ConchT09::yup
ConchT09::Well said, great player but the guy is a clown, super cocky
philweilert::he has a lot of talent but he needs to get his emotions in check

The Bat of Adam Dunn::In this scenario, the T-Wolves give up Love, get Deng, and somehow gain four wins?  Cousins is a wash because he'll spend half the year suspended for trying to kill small children in the park.
King.Awesome::1)  You do know the tradeline's over with, right?  2)  That's a terrible deal for Chicago.  3)  You suck.
Better Call Saul_::I love you.

geeman217::The Bat of Adam Dunn His knee won't get any better sitting on the bench at this point. Might as well get some game experience in to work on strengthening it up now. If he saves it until next year he'll have an extra six months of rust to work off. ___________________ Rose will probably never admit it until he's out the league but his(knee) Injury has made him see Thibbs, GarPax and Reinsdorf as "users" who, put his career in jeopardy last year... And before he puts it on the line, he wants some players capable of going hard like him...

The Bat of Adam Dunn::Meh, I could see that.  I'd find that a bit hard to believe coming from a guy that can't form a simple sentence, but it's pretty clear now that his decisions are largely made by those around him.
geeman217::Rose and his crew know (exactly) of what they speak.  I always get a kick out of people who shhed on athletes who have contracts for Millions of dollars and then "attempt" to mock them as  being not wise.  I think Thibbs and GarPax got Rose's message loud and clear
danicahideshercockwell::I heard on the set of gigli ben affleck fuckedd jlo so hard she $@%!$ out a taco
..Iraq Lobster..::she aint Mexican...she Puerto Rican
rbolfa::As much as I love the bulls having Derrick rose cover the teams flaws is getting sickening over the years. They need another scorer period. Trade whatever it takes except Noah
