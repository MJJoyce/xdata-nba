Cyril::It's nice to see Gerald Green's offense coming along, but I wish he could use that athleticism to pull down some rebounds.  Bledsoe is several inches shorter and hits the glass twice as hard as Green does.
joey::to ogbabyace - yes the coach is white, this maybe the first time he's played jimmer all season and now they win, he should learn if he wants to win the solution is simple - play Jimmer.   When he plays it makes the other players jealous and then they play better too
THE_CHIEF::The key to the Suns being dominant is going to be Plumlee's energy in the middle. They will win 70% of the games when he has a double double and provides a shot blocking presence and maybe 20% of the games where he doesn't bring it. That is based on the microcosm of this first 10th of the season. He is one of the keys for their playoff birth. I meed him to play well because I was an advocate of the Clips hanging on to Bledsoe and trading up Paul for a dominant 2,3, or 5.
J.Singh::... a few more games like this & I won't be surprised if the Kings fire there coach and Cousins demands a trade. I still don't understand what kind of game the Kings are really playing...
gary::The Suns can't rebound, poor defense and the Plumdog can't shoot free throws. Bledsoe was definitely missed.
gary::The Suns are lacking a tough rebounder at power forward.
H7N7::why do teams need like 8 timeouts? #$%$ this, im watching the last two minutes when the game actually matters.
Thomas::I  do  give  thanks  to  the Kings  for  NOT  drafting Curry  or  Thompson .      Cuz  They  would have been  sitting  on the  bench  most  of  the  game  just  watching  .
clint::those Plumlee brothers (Nets and Suns) are pretty good players
Silly::Typical Suns, have big lead early and give it up when it counts.
