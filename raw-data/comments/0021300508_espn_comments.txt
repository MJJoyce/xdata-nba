Andy Gillis::Washington: M. Gortat 18 Pts, 13 Reb, 1 Ast, 1 Stl, 3 Blk    - If the Wizards can get this type of production from Gortat every night then they have a shot to go a long way..
Tim Terry::Charlotte must be trying to secretly tank now. Might be one of the worse teams at home.
Gerry Miller::Two perennial basement dwellers playing a meaningless game midway through failed seasons. I have been a Bullets (Wizards) fan for 40+ years. What a waste of loyalty!
Theodore Gleaton::You don't
Michael Glankler::Both teams are making the playoffs in the East....kind of shows there are at least 8 teams that are worse than both of them.
Robert Buchler::Wow. Just looked it up. Ben Gordon of Charlotte getting $13 Million for alot of DNP's.
Nick Mullinix::These could be the two worst offensive teams in the history of the NBA
Chris Smith::Let's see if the wizards can make a shot in the third
Mindy Spivey::I thought they were the hornets now?
Maggie Page::love john wall , but gotta go with my home team
Eric Jvon Thomas::Wizards will win by 20
Shoot Jung::Bobcats will win!
