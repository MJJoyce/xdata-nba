andrewjohn329-18-78 Fan::Are the Suns tanking?
1547anthony::I just looked up the suns rankings and in every thing there worser with the sorry coach hunter,he sucks ..he ant no coach,how do they expect good free agents to want and play here,when the coach does'nt know what he's doin,he runs his mouth in the media here like he's doin something as a coach.i hope that he  ant around next year,get rid of ,hunter,blanks,babby,they dont know what there doin.here who they should keep,morris bros,johnson,oneal,tucker ,dragic,brown,&amp; the rest got to go,gortat is a 7ft marshmellow,dudley cant defend,beasley just sucks....
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::great win pacers!  love this team!
Calvin9299::Hope the Knicks hold off Indiana for second place and seeding .  The hard charging Pacers won't make it easy.
Senator Cosgrove::Get too excited by this Pacers fans, the Suns are a bunch of prideless f##cks....What is so ironic, is that there fans think that my them losing, they are going to get better draft picks....LOL, what does it matter, what does it matter when fresh new talent will come into a failing franchise with failure players and failure coaching.....This team isn't about winning, but rather padding stats...I will assure everyone this team will finish more than 20 games again below .500 next season...LOL, Beasley, PJ tucker....LOL @ Hunter, comes in and says he is going to change the teams defensive culture, its even worse than when Dantoni was here,...
Senator Cosgrove::LOL, you are yesterdays man.....This current group is trashing everything the great teams had ever done...LOL @ Hunter, comes in talking about improving there defense, this team is worse defensively that when under Dantoni........LFMAO @ Hunter...
bobobob1010::Fourth best ever win percentage moron. Sarver is a joke but we can compete with talent
Taco has a Q::Crazy to think we are only 16 wins away from when the Pacers had the 61-21 record,  obviously we wont come near that, but its nice to be relevent again
JollySwagman27::i hate you ron artest?

83hoosier27::Yep you call someone stupid, instead of just saying they used the wrong word by mistake. Of course I know they are not the same thing.
JollySwagman27::i didn't call you stupid sir.    dominate and dominant aren't the same word.  sorry, i am presently inebriated and typing even one line without typos is a feat.

JollySwagman27::trust me, i've had that fantasy.  the sis-in-law leaves her frilly/lacy panties on the bathroom floor when we visit... so i've had plenty of "creative influence" for those fantasies.
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::im drunk on gin n tonix
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::my fave!
JollySwagman27::I have a bottle of Tanqueray in my freezer that I bought around 2005.  I obviously am not a gin drinker
JollySwagman27::Good game or the Pacers tonigt.  What chance do you give our team to beat the Thunder, Knicks, Celtics, and Clippers before the playoffs start?
JollySwagman27::Okay... so I've saved enough bourbon (Maker's Mark, the only good thing that comes from KY) to have fun tomorrow until i can see my cannabis person on Monday!  I'm feeling good but, my wife is PMSing and i'm not getting any.  where's the good porn tonigth?
NGplayinskillz::Pornhub
JollySwagman27::.
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::I am no model of morality, but looking @ porn while married + getting cannabis = not great ideas/maybe you'll regret?
andrewjohn329-18-78 Fan::You should totally nail her.
JollySwagman27::i have a hard time not fantasizing about my wife's younger sister.  she has some of the sexiest underwear on the planet and she doesn't hide her 'panty laundry; when we visit.

JollySwagman27::my wife is open to fun.  We went to an orgy last year.
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::he lives life on edge like me i think.. but im not maried
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::redtube.com  or just luk on tumblr lol virus free!
TheBrownestBob::I watched Bird, Jordan, Barkley, etc.., and Jordan will always be the GOAT.   LeBron could very well be the best statistical player of all time; the Emmitt Smith of basketball.  But he'll never be Jordan; the Jim Brown of basketball - the Joe Montana of basketball.  They don't have to be the best statistical players ever for people to know they were the best ever.  LeBron's finals record is 1-2.  Jordan's is 6-0 with insane averages.  His game was elevated in the biggest moment.  Time and time again, LeBron has shrunk in the same moments, and that's all I need to know about who the best player ever is.
JollySwagman27::As a Pacer fan, I hated Jordan for a lot of his career but, I always respectedhim.  He is the undisputed greatest player of all time and only Durant has a chance to touch that pedastal.
JollySwagman27::I love LeBrons game honestly and i have a hard time hating the Heat but, I just don't buy him as the type of player that Michael Jordan was.  Perhaps that's my 12 year old fanboy who is unable to discern reality.....
sandshr3w::LOL! @Btownguy... it really sucks when that guy above you would agree with you.. ^_^
Btownguy0405::OH GOD!!! don't agree with me... now i am ashamed.
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::true dat
Btownguy0405::Lebron is way better than durant all around.
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::dwade and LBJ will have more wrings wen its all said n done  just my 2 sense tho
sandshr3w::always your two "sense" huh.. what are those?? your ears or your nose?
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::C'mon man! You just may be getting to be ridiculous now! Can't you put better effort into your grammar/spelling?
TheBrownestBob::So what.  Tom Brady has more rings than Joe Montana but no one is going to debate about who the best QB was.  Joe Montana had 0 interceptions in the Super Bowl.  0!!!
Area55andG2::These next 2 games are big. OKC and LAC.
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::"FireBurnsAlways: RG3 &lt; CAM NEWTON"  or  "Btownguy0405: rg3 is just an average qb... i agree with your point though" (this was posted before post above)  Stop it, just stop it!
Btownguy0405::sorry, rg3 is just average.
Btownguy0405::Andrew luck is a good qb, and has tools to be an elite qb.  don't jump to conclusions, but RG3 is more of a media darling when you look at the facts
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::What else do you have to say: Andrew Luck is/will be a bust?
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::"So you're telling me the Dolphins and Patriots are in the same division, yikes!" -Heat fan
JollySwagman27::I'm glad the Colts don't play the Dolphins and Jets twice a year anymore.   we leave it tot he patriots to own pathetic teams like them and the bills.
JollySwagman27::sadly, i remember attending a lot of games in the 90s (an aunt works for the Colts) where the old dome was mostly Dolphins fans.
Btownguy0405::before the game tannehill was the best rookie qb, then they lost and suddenly it was them saying luck and tannehill are the two best...
Taco has a Q::I remember Dolphins fans were talking sooooo much smack about the Colts before they played (I went to that game)  just to see Luck throw 433 yards against that weak D
11Devin::Seriously though the Suns post game show is hilarious.

JollySwagman27::as a lifelong Indy-are native, I hate almost everything to do with Boston.    you dont spell 'dynasty' with 3 asterisks!

Taco has a Q::Da Heats are da best!  We r gonnaz winz the stanley cup!!  -Heat fan
FireBurnsAlways::If the Pacers Suck then RG3 is just an Average QB  and the  The Cleveland Browns are superbowl contenders.... What world are you living in&gt;?  The Suns Played their Heart out gave it  %115   J O' Neil  wanted it more than anyone tonight...  Pacers gave it about %65 tonight and still won.     Threat to heat??  OF COURSE  Watch the games and analyze things before you talk Smack on the Smack talking Boards!!
FireBurnsAlways::somewhere in LA I think
FireBurnsAlways::REGGIE MILLER LIVES
FireBurnsAlways::no one has liked the original comment though???   Weird o
TheBrownestBob::Browns are a super bowl threat every year before kick-off of preseason.
JollySwagman27::i can't believe Jerry Jones is going to pay Romo that much!
FireBurnsAlways::And if CAR does not... we didnt spend over 100 Mill on Romo or even more on what ATL has lol
FireBurnsAlways::The Panthers really are though...  Not Like Atlanta chances  but still good.  If the Falcons don't make the Superbowl this year... they should relocate to London.  FACT
JollySwagman27::Cowboys are too.
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::lol PACERS R JOKES. wat a lame name 4 a team
JollySwagman27::@83hoosier : i love you b/c i'm drunk and you're a fan but, dominate and dominant aren't the same thing.
83hoosier27::It is called being unique. It is from the dominant ABA team. The ABA which was a great league that brought great players and more excitement to the NBA, but never got the respect. Yes fighting for the 2 spot makes the Pacers a horrible team. Beating the Bulls 3 out of 4 times makes the Pacers suck and beating the Heat 2 out of 3 times means the Pacers are a joke, right? The Heat are great and better, but the Pacers are team built to expose their weaknesses.                                        Wow Jolly whatever not to be mean but one messed up word, with all the bad spelling and wrongly used words on here. Thanks you could have just said I used the wrong word. I am not stupid I know they are not the same thing.
JollySwagman27::Pacers are a type of racing horse.  Colts are a type of horse.  It's a theme, deal with it!
Taco has a Q::I love how you like all your comments like a $@%! you are
wackotheclown7022::Pacer's set the PACE of the game. No one can handle how they play.
FireBurnsAlways::Threat to HEAT???       FACT
Btownguy0405::rg3 is just an average qb... i agree with your point though
Btownguy0405::i agree dufus
FireBurnsAlways::RG3 &lt; CAM NEWTON
11Devin::"Who the hell is Alonzo Mourning"?  -Modern Heat Fan
JollySwagman27::and zo was great... too bad all these bandwagon kiddies think LeBron is the GOAT.  I wish they would've seen players like Bird, Jordan, Barkley, Robinson, Ewing, Olajuwon, etc..
JollySwagman27::Do any of you watch Breaking Bad?  The wife and I just got to the 3rd season cliffhanger and can't wait for the next netflix to arrive!
ptglj517::lol you asked for it stating such a random fact about your personal life.
JollySwagman27::i'm the type that guesses what's gointg go happen 5 minutes before it happens in every tv show and movei i ever watch.  the wife hates it.
Watspoppin99::Walt kills Gus by planting a bomb on the wheelchair dude
JollySwagman27::you $@%!$@ i hate you if that's true and a spoiler.. BUT, i'm drunk enough i won't remember this.
TheBrownestBob::Damn, 46-19 FT disparity?  Were the Suns that sloppy or was the game that fixed?
JollySwagman27::the Pacers have the most dominant frontcourt in the entire leage.  #1 in rebounding, #1 in FG%, #1 in scoring average.
Taco has a Q::refs werent letting them play for sure
TheBrownestBob::Fair enough, Suns were that sloppy you say.
hoops 112hoping::gg Suns fans hopefully you guys can be a playoff team in like 3 years. The Dragon will lead you there, he is really good. Morris is nice, good offensive moves already. Some nice players on this team but you'll have to think about getting rid of Beasley.
dwade grater den jordan 13.0::u sux
PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::You would somehow get lower than an 0 in the grammar section of English class.

11Devin::Maimi, Nigeria?

PhillySportsFan7-ACCT2::Where would these clubs in "Maimi" be found?
Animal7::Shame on the Pacers for there stupidity in not making history and for not giving Phoenix fans an opportunity to cheer Pendergraph.
JollySwagman27::Congrats Suns.  You guys gave us a game despite the positions our respective teams are in.  I can respect the passion and self-respect from Phoenix.  Good luck, and may the Lakers lose out so you get a lottery pick!
TheWalkingDead92::Thank you sir :)
NBA_Fan_First::Did anyone watch the Kings-Lakers game? Kings got the 2002 treatment again.
