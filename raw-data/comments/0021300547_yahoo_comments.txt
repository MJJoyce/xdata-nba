Rick's Rockets::The Bulls are obviously the class of the below average teams.
TaylorD::If Gar thought selling out the fans for the rest of the season was the answer, he forgot to tell thibs who may be the best coach in the history of coaching.   he could take a junior high team ,sell them on next man up and beat most of the eastern cvonference
me::this is unbelievable......Hey management You need to trade away some more players for deffered future compensation.  May I suggest Boozer, Hinrich, Dunleavy, Augustin.  You need to trade away at least two of these guys.....so the team can lose on a regular basis.   and why doesn't Noah slip on a banana peel and miss about a month??? I don't want him to be hurt bad, but would love to see him miss a month.
jose::why do we have Mohammed?
theman::Augustin should definitely be starting
DaGreekMan::I would agree that theyre not    gonna win no title, but they can beat anybody on a given night. They are at leasr gonna make the play-offs.
Anton::I always knew Deng was a cancer to the Bulls team.
John::Bulls had three players with double-doubles !!!
Carlo::DJ Augustin's energetic plays along with Derrick Rose = Dynamic Duo
Vagram::kemba is shooting 50%, what funk r u referring to?
