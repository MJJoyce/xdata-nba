paulleena12::Anybody wants to watch Serena and Maria play tennis at Sony Open ???
Randazzo Peezzeria::who's winning
paulleena12::Serena won in three sets.  6-0 in third set.
Dribbird.::Never really been a Tennis fan.   It's a fun sport to play, but to watch it...   meh
paulleena12::This was a fun game.  Great to see Randolph and Terrence Williams.  Also seems like Terry had taken a conviction to up his level for the playoff preparation.
Hail King RGIII-Pierce is a Boss::<b> Rondo was on the Bench is he coming back or? </b>
Dribbird.::He will be back before Rose.
_I Am A Celtic_::Haahaha imagine
skandosok::he dished a few assists of the bench , you ain't see?
_I Am A Celtic_::Almost had himself a triple double as well
ekim9::"Josh Smith led the Hawks with 18 points but shot just 7 of 23 from the floor and 0 for 6 in the second half. Mike Scott scored 19..."  So Josh Smith scored the most points for the Hawks?  Oh, except for the other guy on the Hawks who had more points.  Got it.  Oh ESPN.  I love your editors.
summa404::still a tru hawks fan...til the day i die......we'll get the next one
Syrindge::Terrance Williams is going to be a factor.
_I Am A Celtic_::!
ThatsGoodSoup7963::HHooray!
TexasLonghorns247::Ainge said he would keep it at the verbal level. Wearing frayed blue jeans and sneakers, he said, "I don't want to mess up his Armani suits and all that hair goop. It would be way too expensive for me."
TexasLonghorns247::paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaul pierce
pops611::hawks got hit with THE TRUTH!!!
Xiu Li::I Am A Celtic_ - I just got home. I'll have to watch the re-run, but I like the result either way  LOL, CELTSFAN91477 YOUR ALTER EGO WAS ALSO M.I.A. CAUGHT AGAIN!!!
Randazzo Peezzeria::troll flagged.
Kaluroso::I want the Celtics at #8 so we can boot them from the playoffs again. Wont happen the celtics will lose in the first round.
Kaluroso::Celtics are toast. Now they have to go on the road to NY and the odds are forever NOT in their favor. Incredible what being away from the beneficial ref calls and the fake crowd noise does to the Celtics. Sad, really.
ejhova217::So refs made them shoot 55% and hit 11 3s are you stupid? 5 more fouls on boston. Lol at least try a little bit man your embarrassing yourself
Mikeferrari23...::Celtics are trash lol 1 win every 6 games won't keep you from getting killed by the heat for the third year in a row
Dribbird.::how do you get 1 win every 6 games and have a record over .500?
paulleena12::Gronk: How do you write in reverse and upside down?
_I Am A Celtic_::Stop it
Dribbird.::ESPN fixed it. :/   It was a script error.   But there are still websites you can go on that will do it for you.
paulleena12::Rondo was sitting on the bench.  He will do his rehab in Boston, so we will see more of him.
Dribbird.::What a game for Shavlik.   We need more of that.
paulleena12::It was Sully reincarnated.  Was a real fun game to watch.  Terrence had 2 great dunks on fast break.  But Randolph was incredible.
Brandon Bass Elbow Jumper::No love for Shavlik Randolph, the boss. 13 rebounds and 9 pts is pretty good. Sullinger numbers if you ask me.
ALLforthelulz::yea but sullinger was extremely consistent before he got hurt. I hope for the same with Randolph. we'll see, they need it for the playoffs
bburwell00::looks like someone's trying to avoid the heat. :)
paulleena12::All Hawk's fans left instantly after the game.
redsox__celtics.::I think the best thing for the Celtics is to be the 7 or 6 seed...depending on where the Knicks are
redsox__celtics.::Didn't catch the game because March Madness has taken over my life... anything special I should know about?
KeithStone.x446::paulleena digs me
redsox__celtics.::Pierce  That is all
bruins fan for life::man fgcu is killing it
paulleena12::Randolph:  13 Boards, 2 Blocks, 1 Assist, 9 Points for 22 Minutes.  He was relentless.
Barrk_40::Fact: Perkins trade was a great plan for the longterm.
ALLforthelulz::still too early I think. you can tell with green with how hes played with KG out, that once he takes over as the definite #1 scorer next to rondo with paul stepping down, he'll really show his skill. the problem with the trade was never about the talent, because jeff obviously does more overall than perkins, it was the fit for the team. Perkins was the PERFECT compliment to KG. it hurt, and still does
Barrk_40::Face it, we still would have lost to Miami and Perkins is almost at the point of riding the bench at this point in OKC.
MikeMamba21::it indeed cost us a run at being Champs in 2011, but Green has just been great, really starting to thrive
zeller2395::It cost us a championship run. FACT
paulleena12::Yes.  Huge for the future.
_I Am A Celtic_:::)
paulleena12::A Fun Game.
_I Am A Celtic_::Shavlik?  Nice!
paulleena12::Randolph was a beast around the boards and his blocks, Terry, PP and Green had great offensive game.
_I Am A Celtic_::I just got home.  I'll have to watch the re-run, but I like the result either way
BRUINSMAN4642::i love boston there ust bringing in young and good players like Averly Bradly
kobe has a little black mamba::<b>Pierce!!!</b>
Randazzo Peezzeria::"Playoffs is right around the corner" pp
paulleena12::Jason Terry had a big game.  This is the kind of offensive production we need from Terry in every game.
KamilLoud::unfortunately JET doesn't have enough gas in the tank at this point to bring it every night  just hope that the off days in the playoffs give him enough time to give us something
KeithStone.x446::"I got this question before, about a year ago, and I basically will say the same answer that I did a year ago," he said Wednesday in an interview with Stephen A. Smith and Ryan Ruocco on ESPN Radio New York, when asked how the Patriots' locker room tolerates Tom Brady, an openly gay player. "You've got to accept the player. Everyone has their own ways to live their life and as long as he's respecting me, keeping distance, respecting myself, I'll respect him back.  ~Rob Gronkowski
paulleena12::You are really messed up Keith.
KeithStone.x446::Your words are hurtful paulleena, and to think of all the times I rubbed one out to your avatar.
kahl1212::yeah his 2 super model girlfriends prove he's gay, $@%!$
TexasLonghorns247::http://games.espn.go.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/en/entry?entryID=1288543
BleedBostonGreenOnTo18_::....-____-
TexasLonghorns247::other than Indiana and Georgetown I'd be a genius.
PP owns Rondo::Lol, Kansas just lost. PP will be mad.
BleedBostonGreenOnTo18_::Did you see that last shot? Why the f*ck did he just not lay it in?
BRUINSMAN4642::ikr dumb dision
PP owns Rondo::Yep, I saw it. Dumb decision
TexasLonghorns247::lol I just saw it  what an idiot
CelticPatriot17::Celtics dropped 118 points today. Yeah, we're "old".
HeatRavensGiantsFanSiince1991::Cs!!!!!!!
TexasLonghorns247::...
Jdzspace::I miss Nebula
BleedBostonGreenOnTo18_::Haha me too. He's one of the few I remember from when I used to come on.
paulleena12::He will be back when RG3 starts back with Redskins.
passin me by::Bass looking like last years Bass we all loved recently
paulleena12::He needs to get more boards but his shooting % is good.
passin me by::last game he did good on the boards
paulleena12::Next game is against Knicks at MSG.  Must win that game.
TexasLonghorns247::We need it!!!
TexasLonghorns247::whaddup PP...
PP owns Rondo::Nothing much, how are you?
TexasLonghorns247::Doin good. Pierce got off tonight!
PP owns Rondo::Valdosta State University is the bomb.
S71498 -_-::#CelticsFam
TexasLonghorns247::ye
S71498 -_-::DT u still here bro?
paulleena12::I think just by the way Randolph hustles for the boards, will make other Celtics rebound too.
oreed8::: Randolph.
HipHopJuice617 supports the Celtics::LetsGoAtlantaHawks,  Where are you at you little bi**h?
BleedBostonGreenOnTo18_::And to make this night EVEN BETTER. The rockets are about to lose. :)
Valdosta Georgia TITLETOWN USA::This Hawks team is possible the worst playoff team ever
PP owns Rondo::I went to Valdosta State University
Valdosta Georgia TITLETOWN USA::DIV 2 Champs.....the only championships this state ever sees, Valdosta St and GA Southern football
SouthernSmoke_Zone_6_ATL::Valdosta is closer to Jacksonville and Orlando than Atlanta, since you have so much to say about Atlanta teams why dont you cheer for the Jags and Magic lol.
Valdosta Georgia TITLETOWN USA::pretty sad those teams have accomplished more in their history than the Falcons and Hawks
LeHalfring::I can't post negative comments you MOD loser?
kahl1212::tissue?
TexasLonghorns247::I think we're all saying the exact same thing about you.
BleedBostonGreenOnTo18_::you mad?
LeHalfring::Yup. Don't like this little white city
paulleena12::So do you think Doc will free Randolph and let him play like he has done wtih Crawford.  I think he will do good against bigs in good teams.
TexasLonghorns247::Yeah... Shavy would help against Miami if he plays like that... Heck he'd probably pull in 20.
