KillaKane324::3: When Derrick Rose's 20-footer at the buzzer beat Milwaukee on Wednesday night, it marked the third time this season that D-Rose launched a potential go-ahead shot within the final 10 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. And Rose has drained all three. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, no other player has made more than two such shots this season; Rose also sank game winners in the season opener against the Lakers and Jan. 3 against Atlanta.
Rossi46Doctor::Can't win them all. The Heat can't win any, though. They're addicted to choking.
KillaKane324::Interesting.....wish this D-Rose showed up last night.  Oh well, can't win them all.
4TouchdownsPolkHigh::KYLE KORVER FOR THREEEEEEE......
Bede Bears::This was the 4th game in 5 nights for Chicago. Players need rest, if they don't get that fundamental necessity, then they perform poorly. That being said, Chicago blew this game, up by 2 with 2 minutes left is a very manageable game.
KillaKane324::Hypocrisy is a solid triat on every teams boards, in case you haven't noted.  When the Heat are the most hated team in the NBA, that hate will cloud the judgement to most fans who enjoy seeing them lose.  It's not anything that you can change, or anything you can stop.  Sorry pal.
Dancing_Chalupa::They were losing most of the game. And using the excuse, always an excuse btw, that you play so much is pretty soft. Every team is going thru a hard schedule this year. Not just the calves.
Dancing_Chalupa::But when the Heat are in the exact same situation, the reasoning is different. Hypocrisy  is a solid trait on Bulls boards. Yesterday, Boozer was getting ripped up on the boards. Boozer was the only Bull that played good.
Bede Bears::Magic did have 48 hours to rest. Just stating the facts. Magic had more rest than the Bulls did. Not really an excuse. Chicago's poor shooting did them in.
ThexSituationx::Good Trade? i get Durant, Westbrook, Kevin Martin, Joakim Noah and i give D Rose, Monta Ellis, Brandon jennings and Dirk? Please comment!
joah5454::LeBron would've airballed. D Rose comes through in the clutch most of the time. Even Kobe and Jordan missed clutch shots through their careers. The difference is that LeBron shies away from clutch moments, and even when he does shoot, he misses.
OBPxx::Except in ECF.  D Rose is Money.
Dancing_Chalupa::You are a clueless idiot. You bandwagoneers need to get a grip on reality.
Nanrad_91::I'm done being frustrated with the Heat trolls--they're here because they love us...despite the fact that it may not be the best kind of love. lol
Steveforprez04::If Derrick Rose ever gets a statue built, it should be made of bricks
LeoPat11::Id rather not trade anyone on the Bulls team they are strong now as a team but the past few games defense hasnt been very good 104 and 99.
LeoPat11::I can't believe the Bulls lost to the Magic...the bulls looked slow and tired to me after a hard fought game up i miliwaukee
Magicmike321::Stop acting like the magic are a bad team.  You look like a nieve fan
albea23yme::he's right though, you're the wrong one, kid
albea23yme::oh and the magic suck
Magicmike321::you suck

Magicmike321::Nice!
Jaywashing::Thanks.
robrenaldi::If Dwight played like he did last night all the time, he would be the most dominating player in the league, guy just doesn't seem to have that killer instict though
RunTheBall22::The man in the middle, from New Mexico....LUKE!!!! LONGLEY!!!!!!!!!!!!
KillaKane324::*facepalm*
Anti-Stratfordian::Luc, not Luke.
chains1910::You know I'd be real interested to see go to a contender and be a role player again? Trevor Ariza. He wanted to be a top scorer, but he really isnt. If he played the Brewer role on the bulls or the battier/miller role on the heat, i think he could thrive again.
Dem_Canes_Man::Yeah, Trevor should have stayed in LA. He was tripping. But you want dudes on your squad that want to win chips, not scoring titles.
chains1910::yea i feel that. He would need to adjust the mindset, but the skill set is a great fit for a complementary wing on a good team.
albea23yme::vanessa hudgens  http://www.lazygirls.info/Vanessa_Anne_Hudgens/Shortshortsgun_WXvwq6P
albea23yme::http://www.lazygirls.info/Vanessa_Anne_Hudgens/Shortshortsgun_WXvwq6P
Dem_Canes_Man::Btravisc is we have a steve nash or ellis you couldnt touch us  ===============================================================================  Monta Ellis is a Black Hole, he has never seen a shot he didn't like.
Btravisc::well Nash at least we just need a better PG then Nelson he fell off
Dem_Canes_Man::Nash is 38 man!  Come on dude. You all need D12 to dominate and be ready to knock down shots. Yet, the wings can't defend so that makes people hesitant on calling them an elite team.
Btravisc::all ORL needs is a better PG and we are better than MIA and CHI
albea23yme::no i'm not tripping over anything i'm sitting down in a chair, so stop talking like a $@%!$@. and they are garbage, look it up
Dem_Canes_Man::carry on dude...carry on.
albea23yme::they are garbage, what have they done since dwight howard has been there? make it to a finals they never deserved to be in only to get raped by the lakers?
albea23yme::they just lost to the bobcats the other night, are you serious?
Dem_Canes_Man::agreed. I want debate that.   But, D12 can take them to an elite level if he wants to. Just don't know where his head is at right now.
robrenaldi::they aren't garbage, they're a top 10 team, just not an elite team. Only real elite teams are Miami, Chicago, OKC, and maybe San Antonio (when healthy).
Dem_Canes_Man::You are tripping dude. They're not garbage.
Btravisc::im just tired of everyone hating on the magic they can $@%! off  all these bandwagon heat fans need to shut the $@%! up
Dem_Canes_Man::dude! Why are you tripping? The Magic isn't garbage. Who is hating on them?
albea23yme::LOL, monta ellis. aka biggest ball hog other than kobe and his team has a better +/- with him OFF THE COURT. idiot
Dem_Canes_Man::now, you are loosing the credibility that you just had Btravisc.   Root for your team though; I feel you.
Btravisc::is we have a steve nash or ellis you couldnt touch us
Dem_Canes_Man::Nash, and Ellis can't defend. Rose will tear them up.   You all need D12 to dominate.
albea23yme::"all ORL needs is a better PG and we are better than MIA and CHI"  is it april fools day? or are you just an idiot?
Dem_Canes_Man::man, you are tripping. Orlando wings can't defend.
Btravisc::I would say CHI is with ORL
robrenaldi::no way, you saw what happened last night, the Magic were on fire from 3, dwight dominated, D-Rose and Deng both had horrible shooting nights and the bulls only lost by five and If korver can make a couple of those wide open 3's they win that game, ORL is 2nd class
Btravisc::they both suck
robrenaldi::The problem is they have 0 tradeable assets and a bunch of bad contracts so upgrading at PG is going to be next to impossible, right now Miami and Chicago are in a class of their own then comes Orl, Ind and Phi
Btravisc::Dwight isnt going to CHI \ we dont want your $@%!$@ Noah or Deng
RunTheBall22::if that point guard is Rose than sure, why not
Dem_Canes_Man::RunTheBall22 thats true, and the biggest reason I don't want him is because he always acts like a baby for no reason. I would much rather bring in a two guard, maybe Mayo  ====================================================================================================================  Mayo is cool..but we are talking about a dynasty. Rose is a match up nightmare in the back court, and D12 is the same in the front court. Surround them with guys who can knock down shots and defend. It will be serious.
RunTheBall22::yeah but than were talking about breaking up a team that is a two guard away from bein maybe the best in the league. I would love to see that combo but than were out of it this year and maybe next while you go and get those shooters.
chains1910::Yea, i'm curious to see how he will recruit, but it's clear he understands the game better than Haith.
Dem_Canes_Man::We'll see. The Canes has been solid all year. Coach Larrannaga has been great for the program.
chains1910::Their size is tough. Big lineup across the board. Makes it tough on Larkin with a 6'5 dude like Dulkys on him. Durand balled out last game though I'm hoping he can again
Dem_Canes_Man::It's all good. Yeah, big game tonight. My brother went to FSU (money issues :)), but FSU is tough.
chains1910::pumped for this FSU game tonight. Not a great matchup for us but we took em down just fine last time. I went to undergrad there and still live in the area. Tough for me as a Bulls fan living less than a mile from the AAA haha
Dem_Canes_Man::You know what it is buddy roe! Da U sir.   My Canes are in trouble though! It hurts down here.
chains1910::yea he knocked down some solid 3's last night and can do so more consistently than brewer. Not quite as solid on D as brewer but no slouch. BTW big canes fan here as well.
RunTheBall22::I would like to see tham bring in a young explosive two guard that can grow with Rose and this core of Deng, Noah and Boozer. but it's goin to be hard to do. we don't have much wiggle room.
Dem_Canes_Man::He isn't what he used to be coming out of Mich State, but he will make you pay at times for doubling down, and off screens and staggers.
chains1910::Yea JRich is more or less the guy we are missing.
Dem_Canes_Man::Mayo is definitely an upgrade at the 2 because he can get his own shot. The Bulls should have pulled the trigger on J. Rich last year though.
chains1910::I agree. Mayo is a nice player and would be an improvement on Brewer, but Howard is a true difference maker. Especially at the rim as we saw last night. Plus then that's one fewer player out there that can actually block rose at the rim haha
Btravisc::ORL to the finals
Btravisc::they can do that  ORL is underrated thye always brush us to the side but we have a better overall team then CHI
Dem_Canes_Man::Nah...in my opinion, ORL isn't better than Chicago. However, the key is D12.  If he goes out to dominates his man, then they can present issues for the entire league. Jameer would have to play like he played last night.
Dem_Canes_Man::they would have to shoot the lights out and D12 would have to play at Shaq's or Duncans' level.
RunTheBall22::would love to see D12 go up against a real center like Shaq or Luke Longly, than see how good he is. no doubt he is a awesome player but the centers today just aren't up to par.
Rossi46Doctor::I'm all about my fellow Bulls fans, but let's not put Luc in the same category as Shaq or D12.  Luc was another anchor MJ dragged to a ring.
LEBEAST JAMES::Luke Longley is GARBABGE!!!!  How dare you put him in the same sentence as Shaq!
53Kevin::That Garbage got 3 rings,How many does Lebrick have?Not1,not 2,not3,not4,not5,not6,not7,NOT ANY!!!!!!!
chains1910::Yo bulls guys what would your thoughts be on a Boozer for Kaman straight up trade? Or maybe try to get a pick out of it too. Salaries match up nicely and Kaman would be 14 mil coming off the books this summer, close to enough to make a FA run at Howard (not that he seems interested anyway).
RunTheBall22::why would they make that trade?
Dem_Canes_Man::Boozer's value is at it's lowest point right now.  You would have to add another player. Kaman can play the 5 very well. Just hope he doesn't go back to Clippers in a buy-out situation.   Problems for the West if that happens.
Dem_Canes_Man::yeah. I would say that Kaman to Chicago would be big for them. He can produce at the 5.
chains1910::Neither has Boozer though. And Boozer at his best was better than Kaman at his. I see where you're coming and agree it probably won't happen, though. Conventional reasoning is that you shed salary when you want to rebuild and taking on boozer would go against that.
Dem_Canes_Man::Kaman hasn't forgotten how to play. I don't think that NO makes that move straight up for Boozer.
chains1910::The hornets don't value Kaman much right now. They only activated him after Landry went down and they want some long term pieces in return for him. Boozer and Gordon can probably make them a fringe playoff team (though that might be worse than being a lottery team). It's not really a worse team than it wouldve been around gasol with that preseason laker trade
chains1910::Maybe see if we could get Xavier Henry in the trade too. He's got some promise at SG
LEBEAST JAMES::Deng out again, Rip always out, the Bulls are so inj prone, kinda reminds me of Portland!
53Kevin::Wade gonna go out again soon.He always get hurt to.
robrenaldi::Dem Canes Man, thank you for being one of the few heat fans that will come on here to talk bball. Most others just talk mad shi.t about nonsense Heat fans , please take your cues from this man
Dem_Canes_Man::hey, there are other Heat fans that are cool. The young lady, and couple of the other guys are cool Heat fans.   But, you already know it's crazy with people. I have seen NY, LA, MIA, Chi, boards and it's filled with crazies. There is nothing wrong with rooting for your team, but I am not the one to talk crazy!
King James is Merciful::and the bulls can beat the HEAT ............ U Bulls fans are funny ....
Nanrad_91::We have beat the Heat before and we will again. Considering that you all lost to the Bucks TWICE--why is it impossible to think you can't lose to the Bulls? Which is a way better team.
Aicyla22::bc im not a prepubescent boy who lives with his mommy
robrenaldi::thank you, why is that so hard for most heat fans to admit
Aicyla22::the bucks in regular season has nothing to do with it.  washington beat LA and Orlando, are they better than both of those teams? (could they beat them in a 7 games series?) absolutely not BUT yes the bulls could beat the heat in a series, the heat have a slight edge, but the bulls have a very good chance
Btravisc::ORL beat both
SevereInsanity::you're right.
Dem_Canes_Man::D12 Taj Hedo Rip Rose  *Bulls fans, you wouldn't take that?
WindyCityAssassin777::I doubt your theory will work they wont be able to take Boozer Noah and dengs contract
Dem_Canes_Man::we're just talking hypotheticals.
Aicyla22::you think rose would share the ball enough with dwight to make that pairing work?
Aicyla22::sometimes you gotta take what you can get.  i.e. lebron. am i glad to have him? hell yes. would i have preferred that he came with no baggage ?absolutely. is it enough for me to not want him on my team? hell no
RunTheBall22::thats true, and the biggest reason I don't want him is because he always acts like a baby for no reason. I would much rather bring in a two guard, maybe Mayo
Aicyla22::he's better than rose bc theres no one that really can compete with him, there are a few PGs &amp; other defenders that can hang with Rose   Howard will act like a baby for no reason, thats a given
SevereInsanity::What struggle? Rose can rack up the assists and points, and Dwight can rack up the points, rebounds, and blocks.
RunTheBall22::Rose will do whatever he needs to do to win and has proven that. if that means sitting on the bench while the bench mob is hot he does with a smile, if that means taking over a game he will do it. the last thing I would worry about is a power struggle unless it all comes from Howard acting like a baby for no reason.
Nanrad_91::Wait??? D12 is dominant in his position, but I wouldn't say better than Rose.
RunTheBall22::It would be a killer combo but this current team has come so far and has a shot I would hate to break that up without giving them a chance
Aicyla22::i didn't say he was a ball hog I'm just saying he likes to take things into his own hands can he truly trust another star? Theres a power struggle between lebron and wade, you don't think this would happen if you brought someone who's better than rose in?
Dem_Canes_Man::Yes, because they both commands the double team.  If you surround shooters around that combination, it will be hard to stop.
RunTheBall22::the whole Rose is a ball hog thing is just not true. nothing more I can say on that
SevereInsanity::good point, but I like my man Deng's defense.
Dem_Canes_Man::I am sorry, by Deng is not an elite guy that you keep off the table. Sorry.
RunTheBall22::would have to see the bench. but maybe
Dem_Canes_Man::whatever they would have to give up.   Long term, the Bulls will be an issue. Yet, if CP3 would have somehow ended up in Orlando with a couple of shooters, they would have been an issue.
Aicyla22::idk about that trade d12 for noah and deng, who else?
Dem_Canes_Man::i am talking about trading Noah, Deng as the center pieces.   D12 and Rose are young.  That is the foundation of starting a dynasty.
RunTheBall22::It's hard to say I wouldn't want to see Rose throwing lobs to D12. that would be a kliier combo. but I want to see what this team can do this year.
LEBEAST JAMES::Dwight Howard made Noah his b.itch last night!
blackzilla24::rebounding
Dem_Canes_Man::no one in this league can play D12 if he wants to dominate.
Aicyla22::im not talking about moving teams or wining a championship I'm just saying Dwight doesn't come close to shaq except maybe in FT % and either way this isn't a centers league anymore who's 2nd to Dwight, Bynum????
Dem_Canes_Man::Shaq is the most dominating player that I have ever seen in my life. Probably in all of Sports (Mike Tyson in his prime was a beast too).  As it stands now, D12 should be running this league.
SevereInsanity::But Shaq had to move teams in order to win a championship, so does dwight*.
Aicyla22::only bc of his stature though, i grew up watching young shaq and dwight doesn't have shit on him
SevereInsanity::+1
SevereInsanity::Indeed, he's a dominant big man. And not many centers are a match for him. Good point out.
ChiSportfan2182::It was raining 3's. 33 pts of orlando 99 points were 3's. It was one of those games where you just shake it off when its over.
ttecza::Yes about that.
Dem_Canes_Man::Yeah....Orlando can be tough when they are knocking them down.
Dem_Canes_Man::Man, who do you all think is going to get traded?
WindyCityAssassin777::Only if wade can stay healthy im saying Wade is injury prone at least keep a healthy lebron
SevereInsanity::that trade won't go through without lebron.
WindyCityAssassin777::Lebron and Dwight  and Bosh would be good because lebron likes to pass in the clutch
Dem_Canes_Man::i just think that the combination of Wade and D12 with Hedo and Chalmers spotting up will be a major issue.  Not to mention Bosh in the mid-range.   Devastating.
SevereInsanity::But Dwayne Wade has more championship experience, and is a BETTER passer. They don't want a 6'4 guard, they want a 6'8 big guy that can DOMINATE, selling lebron out like that would be a guarenteed snag of Dwight.
WindyCityAssassin777::Instead of lebron i would trade wade he is losing his leaping ability
Dem_Canes_Man::good point Severe.
SevereInsanity::But if you take hedo, you get a GREAT 3point shooter, the heat need more of that.
Dem_Canes_Man::then you don't take Hedo.
SevereInsanity::or anyone worth it for that matter.
SevereInsanity::LeBron is more of a hook line and sinker, if they traded wade, they wouldn't get hedo in return.
ttecza::When is the dead line, anyway? I forget.
ttecza::TY
Dem_Canes_Man::3/15
SevereInsanity::LEBRON GOES TO THE MAGIC FOR DWIGHT HOWARD AND HEDO TURKOGLU.  Heat fans stunned.
WindyCityAssassin777::just trade wade instead
SevereInsanity::yep.
Dem_Canes_Man::that team will be a major issue if that was to happen.   All Orlando really need is a DWill/ CP3 type 1 guard to run that show.
SevereInsanity::the only championship the heat won was with a dominant bigman. they can get a championship the way they are now, but with that roster, they're solid as FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF*^%&amp;
Dem_Canes_Man::That will make the Heat better actually.  Chalmers Wade Hedo Bosh D12
Jaywashing::I hope some crazy $@%! goes down. This gigantic $@%!$@%!$@% of speculation will all be disappointing if nothing big happens.
Dem_Canes_Man::Yeah....indeed.   I tell you this, it would be crazy if Boston ships Rondo out.
ttecza::Hard to tell, my friend.
ttecza::Right. There are way too many scenarios and rumors. Something should start to hit the scene soon, I would think.
Dem_Canes_Man::Yep...too many "sources" speculating.
22Young Money::wHO'S WITH ME?
ttecza::Despite the horrible shooting performance by the Bulls. They managed to attempt a come back win. The Bulls are still strong on defense, enabling the come back. However, their shooting let them down in the end. Expecting them to move on with the season and bounce back against Utah.  Go Bulls!
22Young Money::Man this is dudu GO HEAT
RunTheBall22::Lebron had to quiet the crowed because if Wades misses free throws he beats Lebron before they go to bed
SevereInsanity::based god.
42Wolverine21::HEAT 2012 NBA FINALS CHAMPS LBJAMES FINALS MVP
Nanrad_91::Here we go again with the pre-mature celebrations.

LEBEAST JAMES::SevereInsanityLEBEAST JAMES  Member Since: March, 07 2012 ---------------------------------------------------- This means nothing, stay off my profile weirdo
SevereInsanity::it's called finding out if you're a troll or not.
42Wolverine21::for real man
RunTheBall22::look at the heat butt buddies. lol
Robert24907::ok the kids are back so im out!!!!!!!!!
LEBEAST JAMES::No Matter who finishes with the top record in the league between the Bulls and Heat, no matter who gets home court advantage in the playoffs, the Bulls are the same team they were last yr, while the Heat are much improved, if the Bulls get far enough to play the Heat they will be swept! Miami break out the damn brooms!
Jaywashing::Neither team changed much at all. The Heat added depth to the small forward position and the Bulls got a thus-far disappointing shooting guard (who I still say will pay dividends in the postseason). I see a lot of Heat fans saying "The Heat got better and the Bulls didn't," but that's all they say. It never makes much sense.
TheWalrusnow::wait how has miami gotten significantly better while the bulls have remained the same? the bulls have added a new starting sg, they have young talent/players that have arguably improved. it is like stating after the bulls lost to the pistons in 1990 and then came back the next yr that the bulls were not improved and thus could not beat the pistons, that was the wrong assumption then and it is the wrong assumption now. experience like what the bulls had last yrs. improves teams and players in itself.
Hands Off Hobo Joe::I wish it weren't true, and I don't think the Bulls will get swept...but you're right, Chicago has pretty much stayed the same while Miami has improved. Hard to see a playoff series between them turning out any differently from last years.
Nanrad_91::I don't; I think there has been improvements, but we have been plagued by injuries and other things, so these improvements are overlooked.
Hands Off Hobo Joe::The Heat beat Chicago without Battier. There is no "missing piece" when it comes to beating Chicago because they've already done it.
RunTheBall22::yeah, Battier was the missing piece. LOL
SevereInsanity::LEBEAST JAMES Member Since: March, 07 2012
SevereInsanity::And he just made it 10x more pointless. I'm done.
42Wolverine21::u got poo on your chin
TheWalrusnow::you guys are having an idiotic, pointless conversation.
SevereInsanity::Am I speaking too intelligent for you to understand? Which instantly makes me "gay" in your eyes?
SevereInsanity::How is graduating highschool, going to College and getting a real job, and living in a nice house with a fiance being gay?
42Wolverine21::lol you gay man?
SevereInsanity::Selling drugs, none the less. That's nothing to be proud of, lol.  NOT graduating.
42Wolverine21::$$$$$  i makin bank wout school $$$$$
SevereInsanity::Get a highschool education then come back and talk to me. Christ.
42Wolverine21::go home lil boy
heisenburg_1::How is this not the best trade for Orlando? ......Dwight and Ryan Anderson for Blake and DAJ. Nobody has even mentioned it. And how does either team say no to that?
heisenburg_1::And I could see Stan Van turning blake into a decent defender. Vinny is not doing him any favors in LA.
TheWalrusnow::that trade was discussed on espn a few weeks back. it would be an extremely smart trade for orlando as they will be losing howard this summer. however, devos is being a selfish idiot, caring more about himself than the future of the franchise and the city of orlando.
heisenburg_1::The problem with the Clips is their defense. Dwight would fix that in a second.
Dem_Canes_Man::The Clippers will get to the Finals.
Dem_Canes_Man::With D12, Ra and CP3 at the 1.  They can get by anybody.
42Wolverine21::waheheeehe!!!!!!!!!! you snortin poo?????
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Rose tweeted kobe and asked him of he wanted to open up a masonary company.....bricks....bricks....bricks....
Dem_Canes_Man::What up people...how is it going in here? Has it calmed down, or is it still crazy!
Robert24907::good- nite!!!!!!1
RunTheBall22::This shortened schedule has made for one exciting season so far, I'm all for doin away with the 82 games. it doesn't need to be this compressed but this has been one of the more fun and exciting seasons to watch.
pspank1::I agree with you...  It's always a game on..and you right exciting
TheWalrusnow::82 season is better. this has been a good season soley bc their are great teams and players in the league. last yr. was also a great yr. however over the next few yrs. the level of play should continue to rise, as the young talent (durant, rose, westbrook, griffin, love, etc.) continue to improve their games.
TheWalrusnow::when did the players admit to not caring about the season until christmas? that has been ridiculous commentators making such statements.
RunTheBall22::no one even cares about the season till around Christmas anyway. even the players have admitted to that. it's just to long, and the playoffs already take forever
pspank1::Look at all the BUlls fans in here...We even have Heat fans in here for the Bulls...nice
pspank1::Hey Aicyla,  u still here.  It looks like it got worse in here.  I like how you standing in there...
Robert24907::Nanrad_91 makes kinda a good point, its kinda hard to be critical of my kids to someone else, ithink it hard to find things wrong with my team.
Nanrad_91::I didn't say that you had to find things wrong with your kids, but even if your opinion is valid, it doesn't give you or anyone else the right to bad mouth another kid (or team). That's all.
LEBEAST JAMES::Rose blew that game last night! 6-22 from the field! Ouch and missed another crucial freethrow yet again! Bulls need help ASAP
SevereInsanity::LEBEAST JAMES Member Since: March, 07 2012  Nice one, now go somewhere else and troll.
SevereInsanity::Because he was saying $@%!$@%! things I don't have the right to see if he's not a troll? Lol.
LEBEAST JAMES::Who cares? this proves what
42Wolverine21::damn you're nosy lil boy
TheWalrusnow::rose did have an off night last night, so did everyone but boozer and gibson. korver had several opportunities to either tie or take a lead with open threes, deng was basically non-existent. rose looked tired and was leaving all of his shots short and missing layups he usually makes. it was an overall bad game for the bulls.  however, losing by 5, when two of your top 3 players go 7-31 fromt he field, your starting center 3-7, your "shooting specialist" 1-5 from three, and your starting sg, is benched in the 4th, while a top 5 team shoots 50% from three and their superstar center notorious for his free-throw woes shoots 70% from the line, one would think that the bulls shouldnt be worried.
RunTheBall22::yeah it was a bad game but I did like how they fought back and made it close. to much D12 and 3 point shooting in the though
42Wolverine21::they need dhoward to compete w heat
SevereInsanity::Cool story bro.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Whaaaa.......whaaaaaaa......whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.........
Nanrad_91::Here's why the Heat gets so much crap apart from the Decision: SOME of their fans. I'm not talking about the level-headed ones, but the ones who says that the Finals are in the Heats pockets and that everyone else is crap in comparison. They'll insult teams when they lose, and then find excuses for when they lose. For example, when Rose missed a crucial free throw in the end, he is a choker and has always been. But, when LeBron does it, it's "But, he scored 34, 10 rebounds, 9 assists." (made a stat--I don't know his numbers) The same goes for other teams--it doesn't matter how well they did, it is always downplayed to uplift the Heat.
Nanrad_91::Robert, I met some parents who has. But, there is a difference between saying great things about your child and belittle another child in comparison. It's like saying, "My child is incredibly intelligent and your child is intellectually inferior." You can say the first without saying the other.
Aicyla22::why even worry about what the trolls say? they do that to get under your skin and obviously its working.
TheWalrusnow::the heat mainly get crap bc fans were upset about the decision.  it is an idiotic reason to be upset, but most nba fans are idiotic.  as for the description provided above most fans blame someone else for the lost, the bulls fans usually do so as well. d-rose does however take the blame for some losses which is what a leader and player should do. fans then defend rose for doing so and blame other factors instead for the loss
Nanrad_91::Hmm??? I've said the Decision is one of the reasons they get crap, but just about every fan I've met always belittles every other team--win or loss. I don't know about other fans, but if the Bulls lose, I blame it on the Bulls if they played poorly. Like the loss this year v. the Heat, Rose should have made those free throws. I don't think I've ever blamed another team for the Bulls playing bad.
Robert24907::It depends ,its like talking bad about ur kids to someone you can not do it...
42Wolverine21::every other team inferior to the heat it a known fact
TheWalrusnow::i actually agree the heat are the best team in the nba, but that is my opinion NOT fact as you state.
Nanrad_91::It may not, but it is a way to measure the success of a team. But, then again, you would switch your argument around if they did have the top spot.
42Wolverine21::best record don neccesitate best team
TheWalrusnow::when you state "fact" you mean opinion. the heat dont have the best record in the league, so they cant be objectively considered the best team in the league.
NoThanks2U_7::idk about you guys but i'm tried of getting suspended over night by the mods... wtf!
Robert24907::I think in the playoffs rose and c j watson on the floor a the same time is going to be good,cause rose could play shooting guard and c j pg.
TheWalrusnow::so you think going small and forcing either watson or rose to guard bigger players is good for the bulls, basically taking away their defensive advantage? watson is okay to play with rose, when watson is hitting his shots, but in that scenario, rose usually still handles the ball as watson is a fairly poor passer/ball-handler for a pg.
TheWalrusnow::it makes sense on certain occasions. but it hurts them defensively and again when this usually happens during the regular season, it is rose still dominating the ball and bringing it up.
Robert24907::Rose would be more free to drive to the basket and kick it out to watson or deng,plus he would not have to bring the ball up every trip.
LEBEAST JAMES::Welcome to CHOKE CITY! Population Derrick Rose!
42Wolverine21::i know right, drose chokin v the heat earlier this year
TheWalrusnow::what is the point of bringing up a game 3 weeks ago, if not simply to incite? did d-rose choke that game? yes, but he was also the sole reason the bulls were in that game. furthermore he has been extremely clutch in many games this season, see two nights ago against milwaukee and opening night against the lakers, not to mention against the sixers on sunday.
SevereInsanity::Damn that ONE game sucks man. and btw, wasn't just talking about LeBron, I'm talking about the whole team.
42Wolverine21::damn i was jus talkin bout drose. everyone always talkin crap w lebron an 4th quarters, drose missin crucial freethrows v the heat in 4th quarter means he choked
SevereInsanity::Look at all those games, every game that I looked at involved an Overtime breakdown, or a fourth quarter breakdown, please.. please test me.
SevereInsanity::i know right, theheat chokin v the mavs last year Theheat chokin v the jazz this year v the lakers this year v the warriors this year v the clippers this year v the bucks this year v the hawks this year v the nuggets this year v the magic this year  bout the only non-choking, non-fourth quarter breakdown the heat haven't had this year, was the first game against the bucks.
LEBEAST JAMES::Good one! Copy Much
SevereInsanity::Good one! Room to talk Much
TheWalrusnow::choke? you talking about his game winner against milwaukee?
SevereInsanity::Welcome to CHOKE CITY! Population Miami!
