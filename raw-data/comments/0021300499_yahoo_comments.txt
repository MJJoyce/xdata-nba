Jethro & Granny::The Cavs are the worst shooting team in the NBA.  If they can't get that round ball in that round hoop, find somebody who can.
The Question::Stats man! 30 teams,69 title series,59 titles have been won by 10 teams with multiple championships,8 teams with one each, and 7 have never gone to the finals. 15 of the league's current teams have not won one.I expect a title in 24 years Cavs!
Lawrence::Small forward position tonight was shared by 3 players, and they scored a total of 8 points.And some believe this team is playoff material? I would like to know what they are smoking?How about blowing smoke up their a--es.
Lawrence::Jack and Clark have been free agent signing DUDS. Draft picks Bennett,Felix and the Russian kid have been DUDS. Just an example why management ,coaches and scouts should all be fired ASAP.
Sherri::I am a big Pacer fan, but there is reason for concern this evening. 4 of our six loses came on the second of a back to back that was an away game. This is the only time we typically do not do well.  We have won in this situation and I believe we can tonight. I just think the Pacers need to figure this situation out.
Commenter::Indiana for the win
HORSESHOE::The Pacers and the Colts are rockin' Indy!!!  Go Pacers - it's always fun to watch you guys play as a team.  GO Colts next weekend!  Luck is on his way to becoming one of the great ones.
Barancy Peloma::go get 'em pacers!!!!
MONTE::I've been a Cavs fan all my life and this season is bad, come on guys we had the No. one pick are we going to remain the mistake by the lake. The Bobcats oops I mean the Hornets are looking good. Signed, A loyal fan from Cleveland living in NC
tom chong::Good to see Delly getting alot of court time!
