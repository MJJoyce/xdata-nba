SportzSoul3711::Hey Guys i missed this game because it wasn't viewing in my are so who was it who hit chris paul in the nose was it an "accident"?
Bexindy55::After 11 straight beatdowns I guess we'll let the Clippers win a game.  No way Paul drops 36 pts. with Parker in there.  Hope the Clips fans enjoyed the asterisk game.
JeremyLinTimTebow...::Because Parker is so stellar on defense...there are no asterisks on regular season games.  And if we want to nitpick, Kenyon Martin and Billups didn't play for the Clips.
Bexindy55::Freakin Spurs with their injuries.  Knock on wood that isn't next.  They could go far if they had everyone healthy for the playoffs.
Bexindy55::...that "Duncan" isn't next.
jorgii05::yep that Duncan is one of those top draft pick bust like Kwame.
KeraGriffin32::I love when CP3 takes over games!! Especially with Chauncey gone. They need some more offense. Chris and Blake are a one two punch. Add Mo's instant offense and other teams may have a problem.
KeraGriffin32::INSTANT MO!!!!!
lakershowcenter::JOSH SMITH TRADE RUMORS HEATING UP  http://www.fancloud.com/nba/nbachat
torrtis::Parker chose a previous game to play hard, too hard that he can't play another. That's the trend nowadays LOL.
KeraGriffin32::It was Pop's decision. Sometimes it's not the players who choose to sit out. They play basketball for a living. It's their passion. They wanna play. Sometimes the coaches have to make tough decisions. Especially in a season like this. You need your key players to be healthy. So do you leave him out there, risk further injury, and end up losing him for a very long period of time or demand that he rest and not push his body too hard?
Kobrick is a thug::<b>Hahahahahahahahaha..... Spurs are looking old and destined for another CHOKE!  CP3: best athlete in LA sports history.</b>

OrangeTempo::I like CP3 style~   I am from china,
jorgii05::Are you that blind lawyer dude who is now coming to the US with his whole family for free? Welcome to the US btw!
pioms::I like China! I am from US!
Dancing_Chalupa::Those Bulls trolls should watch some Clipper games and see what a real point guard looks like, and not the overrated fake mvp they have there now.
pioms::Apples and Oranges. Ali and Tyson. Old School PG, New School PG. You can't compare the two.
KeraGriffin32::Rose is sick but what people fail to realize is that he and CP3 are not the same kind of point gaurd. CP3 is a traditional point gaurd. His game is true to the position. Pass first. Facilitate. Set your teammates up for the shots they need. Rose is more of a shoot first kinda guy. If that's what that particular team needs then Rose is your guy. However, if you have a team full of guys who can't really create their own shots then you need a PG like Chris Paul. They are definitely the top 2. I think choosing one of them depends on the specific needs of the team.
Yo11Centerfield9::Interesting... It seems that Chauncey Billups was the key to the Clippers success,
KeraGriffin32::They both were. Chauncey is a scorer and is amazing in the clutch. Having him AND Chris out there together made up for the lack of contribution from the bench. Chauncey being out just left a big hole in the offense. Especially considering the fact that CP is a pass first kinda guy. Now if he takes over games the way he did against the Spurs and scores more. They'll be better. He kinda has to fill that void of Chauncey being gone.
Clipshow07::You are waaaaay off base with that call. I mean I love CP3 but Derick Rose is sick and definitely not overrated.
1Dre8::Your right. Especially when Rose drops 32 pts and 16 assists on chris paul
NOVABuffalo::Clippers played well, but I recall a time when a team would put 120 on the Spurs, the Coyote would be shot by Pop.
Bexindy55::Haha.  You're delusional.  Pop gets 4 rings with a small market team and playoff appearances every single year since he's taken over.
pioms::Best coach in the game.
Nerissa2525::Overrated with 4 rings yeah right
NOVABuffalo::I agree with this one.
nolefan6363::Not with Dick Jefferson starting.
nolefan6363::Pop is sooooooooooooo overrated! Don't agree? Well, who else would continue to start Dick Jefferson and keep Matt Bonner on the roster?
jonathan3019::Clippers. Won't make it past the western conference finals and we all know that
pioms::I'd be totally happy with a WCF appearance!!!!
KeraGriffin32::I think we all knew they wouldn't become a championship team overnight but there is promise in this team and they'll have their season in the near future. No doubt about that. I don't doubt that they'll make a hell of a run in THIS year's playoffs.... but I don't think a ring is in the cards this season.
Clipshow07::I would have to tend to agree with you and it's because of the fact that are defense is pretty much non-existent. If we can tighten up our d on a consistent basis than we have a chance. We really needed Chauncy to make a run that far. Best we can hope is that he comes back soon and starts "coaching".
drmcfunk::Yeah seriously as a long time CLIP fan just having a winning record is awesome and something most teams in the NBA dont have. As long as we keep it going i feel like next year will be our best shot at the title
kezmicdust::As a Clipper fan, I'd be very happy if we made it that far!
Ultras South::Clippers = Bandwagon since this year. FACT! Talented team though.
KeraGriffin32::Well you gotta understand that nobody could even tell you the names of the starting line-up before this year. They got key guys that the people actually KNOW. CP3, Chauncey, K-Mart, Blake Griffin who made a name for himself in the previous season. When you get guys like that, you can't but attract fans.
gt1master_ike::Chris Paul is a beast. Imagine if he still has his pre injury burst. The dude would easily be the best point in the league no questions about it.
Andy Devendorf::http://t.co/z9dGh4pp &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong> Rumor: Pau Gasol traded to the Rockets for Lowry and Scola. </strong>
Txboy12345::It's nice to lose 4 outta 7 and still be the 2nd seed and still only be 4 1/2 behide OKC. Then again, winning all those games we would be 1/2 behind OKC....
SB47-Locker10::As long as everybody is healthy coming playoff time !! It's all GD!! Most importantly is winning in playoffs !! Could care less about SA seeding!
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Agreed!!!!
Antsea91::<b> Clippers suck.</b>
SpeakerOfTruth7::Man losing Chauncey hurt though. With him, we maybe win the west
roger_z0::Sure thing bro
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Lmfao^
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::How long is he out?
WreckemTxTech::Please don't say bro like that Jersey crap show
SpeakerOfTruth7::For the year bro
SpeakerOfTruth7::This is boring. I was expecting a bunch of jealous Laker fans in here
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::They're in hiding.
SpeakerOfTruth7::Hey Lakers, we let you sit in our seat tonight at 1st place in the Pacific for about an hour tonght LOL. How did it feel?
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Believe me....their era has come to an end...no phil...no more dynasty.
SB47-Locker10::CP3 took advantage for a once in a lifetime win vs SPURS MINUS PARKER!! Enjoy clippers! IT'S A RARE OPPORTUNITY! :) LOL
Bexindy55::Chauncey? Hahaha.  That guy is totally washed up.  Insignificant on the floor.
sly86921::Billups holds thevteam together. That 3 gm losing streak wouldn't have happened with billups
Nerissa2525::Win is a win but Chauncy is not their leading scorer or PG but Parker is.
roger_z0::No excuses, clippers without chauncy
BRAY5150::Win is a win
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::And only their first win in SA in 17 games.
holmes90001::go Lakers
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::where?
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::Farther then the Cowboys,. talk about a dead franchise..lol
WavyBaby1988::One thing I seriously hate seeing is Oh this guy is a real point guard this guy is a fake point guard like shut the f*ck up !! If he's listed as Pg he's a f*ckin Pg you decide because a guy doesn't have a certain amount off assists he Ian a point... It's like saying a run firs Qb is a "real quarterback" it's stupid ! Cp3 Nash Rondo Westbrook Rose Jennings all POINT GUARDS
Dane Kitazaki::bonner sucks, the spurs are terrible
SB47-Locker10::kitazaki SUCKING ON THEM KRISPY KREME DOUGHNUT " FAT ORCA SPECIAL"!!

redbob4444::what happened with Deandre jordan ?
redbob4444::thanks
Dane Kitazaki::foul trouble
redbob4444::why only 5 min ?
laxfiles::the clips over paid him.
smr1274@gmail.com::They didnt, blame the Warriors for that godawful offer sheet, or else we probably would've been stuck with Kaman.
iwentpp3::I say the Clippers won't make playoffs and will end up in lottery.  Lakers going to finals....SWEEPING the Heat 4-0 baby!!!!      Thumbs up if you agree! (if you don't agree then maybe you don't know ANYTHING about basketball)
smr1274@gmail.com::Thanks man, that's the funniest thing I've heard all day
Nerissa2525::hahahaha your dreaming dude wake up
GBTsports7::The reason I'm not agreeing is because YOU know nothing about basketball. Lakers are old and Clippers will run them over in a best of 7.
SB47-Locker10::Wiz&gt; LAKERS!
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::What the hell is this dude on?
Dane Kitazaki::lakers suck
redbob4444::na not really i just hate haters
redbob4444::im the 1 who like his status
redbob4444::so other dude is dumb im an idiot u mad man ?
IlyaKol::Then you're an idiot lol. Lakers will be lucky to get past the 1st round with their AWFUL road record. If they don't get home court and are expected to win on the road to advance...forget it.
IlyaKol::Stop liking your own statuses. It's dumb.
IlyaKol::You need to put down whatever it is you are smoking.
iwentpp3::So you don't agree?  Maybe you need a reality check.
IlyaKol::Hate to beat a dead horse (been saying this for months now)...  CP3 &gt; Rose. The ONLY thing Rose can do better than CP3 is attack the basket. That's it.  CP3 = better shooter, more efficient shooter (picks his spots better, etc.), WAY better passer, better defender, more of a pure floor general, etc.  Rose is just an off-guard playing PG. Can pass, but prefers to score.  36 Pts, 4 Reb, 11 Ast, 4 Stl? Really? Great game.  And before you Rose-Shlong suckers start commenting about how Rose owns CP3 when they play...Rose's teams &gt; CP3's team. By a lot. CP3 is usually looking to set up his team not score like Rose. CP3 can drop 30 on any given night if he wants...but, like Lebron, he keeps his team involved and trusts his team. Rose, on the other hand, is like Kobe. I don't think he truly trusts his team.
smr1274@gmail.com::Again with the Rose&gt;CP3 or CP3&gt; Rose thing, $@%! man get over it already!
1Dre8::I dunno, chris paul himself did say rose was a better pg. And he did have 17 assists against paul
GBTsports7::Rose is not a true PG in the NBA. CP3 can pass, score, and rebound. A team does not revolve around the PG. It goes around the rock star, Blake Griffin. Rose runs a one man show in Chicago.
dabears2253::roses team may be better but CP3 has better players on offense which allows him to get more assists.
marting260::NUT GRIPPER..CP3 CANT GAURD ROSE...LAST MEETING ROSE..29..17 ASSIST..  CP3 WAS TELING BLAKE TO SET MAD PICKS CUZ ROSE WAS ALL OVER HIM...  MOST OF HES ASSIST ARE LOBS TO JORDAN AND GRIFFIN..ANYBODY CAN DO THAT   SAY WHAT U WANT ITS BEEN CLEARLY SAID ROSE IS THE BEST..THEY SAY IT ON ALL THESE SPORTS SITES AND NETWORKS...
IlyaKol::Relax with the caps there kiddo.  Rose is much faster than CP3. Which is what I said. Speed is one of the biggest strengths of anyone who can attack the basket. But when it comes to playing the PG position like a PG is supposed to play it? CP3 is way better than Rose.  Rose is a SG playing PG because no one else on the Bulls can play it. John Lucas? Come on. Watson? Get out of here.  Westbrook and Rose are 2 guards pretending to be PG's. Neither of them have EVER averaged as many assists as CP3 and don't give me that 'he's had people to pass to crap'. Who did he have in NO to pass to? Not that much.
marting260::stop suckin cp3s c o c k....rose all day he makes cp3 look like a 8 year old out there..
marting260::ROSE ALL DAY...EVERYSINGLE MEETING THEY PLAYED...ROSE WAS ON TOP...HES A BETTER PASSER BUT HES EFFECIENCY IS BETTER CUZ HE HAS SOME BETTER SCORERES IN GRIFFIN BILLUPS MO WILLIAMS AND BUTLER...ROSE IS THE PRIMARY SCORER..TAKES LAST SECOND SHOT..AND TOUGH BASKETS...ROSE ALLL DAY CHECK THE STATS..NO CONTEST..ENOUGH SAID,,,
IlyaKol::Sure he does. I'm not a Clippers fan or a Hornets fan. CP3 is the best PG (not guard) in the game. Rose should play SG...he'd be better at it.
Clipshow07::9 for 9 three pointers with 11 assists. CP3 IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OVERRATED.  Let's hear it all you f ing yarners. CP3 is SOOOOOOOOOOOVERRATED!!!  Bottom line here is we still gave up 108 points. We are going nowhere if we can't learn to play some defense. Our offense can't consistently make up for our lack of defense, especially not in the playoffs I'm afraid.
jruss1427::i do beleive hes being sarcastic guys!lol!
dabears2253::and the spurs didnt even have their best player
Blitzbolt::Cp3 is not overrated the rest of the clipps yes.  Last year Hornets all over again.
Txboy12345::Well the Thunder lost to the Cavs, that's about as rare as the Clippers winning in SA, so we knew something was going to happen. lol
Blitzbolt::the West is crazy.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::$@%! happens! Lol
Blitzbolt::Are the Spurs ever gonna be at 100% because I'm so tired of that excuse and I'm not even a clipps fan.
vinnie_del_n.igger::THE CLIPPERS NEED TO FIRE VINNIE ALREADY!!!!!
PadresChargersClippers::Vinny is at least A LOT better than mike dunleavy.
laxfiles::Dunleavy always needed a really smart PG to memorize his huge playbook. If he had Billups I'm sure Dunleavy would've never got fired.
Clipshow07::No, I wouldn't come close to saying A LOT better. If Dunleavy had this same team, I think he would be doing better. Of course that is useless speculation at this point.
Clipshow07::Wow, crazy screen name there. I don't think he's that good either but you've taken it to a new level with that screen name. You'd of think VDN would've learned to implement some defense from Popovich, huh? Not the case, Clippers play no defense whatsoever!
Killabeezle::another "big picture" loss for the spurs
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Elaborate then.^
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::And thanks to coach Vinny he gets a win against he's former team. Haha
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Like the beating the blazers put on our Spurs when he rested Tim and Tony.
txryguy4.0::thanks to coach pop resting parker
cadarn1::Can we talk about the Lakers home/road record as proof that they get ridiculous homecourt officiating
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Kobe always cries to the refs....hollywood actor. Btw....I'd root for the clips anyday...and hopefully the clips can dominate the lakers since the phil era is over.
IlyaKol::Fan of neither LA team. Kobe DOES complain a LOT to the refs. People say Wade/Lebron whine...but Kobe glares at one of the refs damn near every time down the court. It's ridiculous.
comedy2424::Mo Williams on clippers live talking about the will and his 30point game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZLsl4j6ZSk&amp;feature=channel

supreme91::Did Pop rest Parker or something???
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Right quad contusion...he's coming back next game I think.
lewisrush12::Injured with a right quad contusion
Lavender5226::he has a few minor injuries so Pop gave him the night off
Fattyarbuckle1313::That Chris Paul guy is pretty good at basketball
lewisrush12::Third best PG in the West after Parker and Westbrook
IlyaKol::lol. Westbrook? Westbook is like Rose. SG's masquerading as PG's. They are shoot first players. PG's should NOT be shoot first (see Nash, Paul, etc.)
GermanKlippa::HaHaHaHaHa....made my night, dude.....now, I am really outta here......LOL....Westbrook......!!
clippsallday::You aint lying.
clippsallday::As a Clippers fan, id hate play the Thunder, Nuggets(if healthy) nd Grizzlies in the play offs, but im more than ok playing the rest of the west
clippsallday::Cmon now dude, the wolves games were BS nd the refs were against us. Also their inexperienced nd we got home court if so.
cadarn1::Anyone but the wolves
The_Guido::Nuggets don't seem like they have a lot of playoff xp and the Thunder can ball
clippsallday::then*
clippsallday::Yea, but with Billups idc who we play. Too bad he wont be able to return by than...
PadresChargersClippers::Nuggets are the team (if healthy) that I would be most scared to play, besides the heat maybe.
lewisrush12::It's all gravy until playoff time....the rest is just havin fun and talking until the last couple weeks of the regular season.  West is wide open this year.
eightman2303::memphis about to get zack back, too....that team is going to make some noise and could steal the southwest if the spurs and mavs don't wake up....
The_Guido::what happened to DJ? he only played 5min
The_Guido::as long as he isn't hurt
The_Guido::lol WTF
PadresChargersClippers::Breathing?
GermanKlippa::Man, he was called for ticky-tacky fouls.....you are supposed to be native speakers ?!?
GermanKlippa::He was called for breathing on Ginobili....or Duncan for that matter.....
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::???
cadarn1::Let's be honest, both teams have issues that need work before the playoffs.  Would love to see this match up.
PadresChargersClippers::I agree.
PadresChargersClippers::I hope the clippers keep Mo Williams.
The_Guido::They already said they wont trade him
PadresChargersClippers::Sweet! (:
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Clip fans coming out of their closets getting wet for oNe win! Lmfao

cadarn1::U mad lol
PadresChargersClippers::actually #23?
eightman2303::suddenly, the spurs have hit this funky stretch.....better now, maybe, than next month......  the defense....wow....I mean, just no aggresiveness at all...ho hum and when shooters get hot, its almost too late to do anything about it.....  anyway...great play by the Clips....they did what they had to do.   Moving on and awaiting the wizards.....
clippsallday::Nd Spurs fans real talk my boii Maun is the leader of the team when his healthy, not parker.
clippsallday::Manu*
OutOnStrikes11::Spurs defense is atrocious,good enough to win maybe 2 games again in the playoffs before getting sent packing like last season
Soonerhopeful1::I think  Griffin will rival Duncan as to PF's over time,    if he stays healthy...  The Kid is good, and can play center..!
Lavender5226::unless griffin develops more of his game he won't have a very long career.  Once he starts getting older and loses some of his athleticism he will need to do things like hit jumpers and have a very well developed post game
Soonerhopeful1::Funny  there is only one group who suggest Griffin is over rated...  Homer fans..!   Those who extoll and praise Griffin the highest, are his contemporaries, like Duncan  Love and Amare and etc , Players and even coach's all fear the Griffin, he is a monster..!
The_Guido::why shoot a jump shot if u can just dunk over people? i'll take the high % shot all day
SB47-Locker10::Overrated DUNKING MACHINE !!
