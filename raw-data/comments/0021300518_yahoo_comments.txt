Guest::Love the Melo comparisons now. Hey genius' KD was taking 18.2 shots per game with RW. Now 23.2. RW was taking 17.9 per game. So wow KD is taking 5 more shots per game in his absence. Isn't that what he should be doing? Or do you want him to take the same amount so you can call him a coward? A lot of jealousy going on because so far KD has kept them with a winning record so far at 4-3. Boohoo.
Tony Anthony::Gordon Hayward is amazing. It's good I got him on fantasy.
ThirdyDot::Utah started playing not to lose in this 4th quarter instead unconscious play-making and being aggressive in going to the basket and it's costing them a lot of points right now.
Eric C::Sefolosha needs to stop shooting. His shot is off this game, i mean this year.
Curtis::Sorry Thunder, injuries do make the difference in this game and the Thunder will lose tonight, however the Thunder do have the making of a championship team and I hope you beat the Heat this year in the NBA finals!!
bluuzman::Ho hum. Another game with the NBA trotting Durant to the line 20 times.
Curtis::Sorry Thunder, but you will not win tonight against the five lottery players the Jazz have drafted the past four years. They are ready to throw the hammer down on the Thunder and will win by 5 points tonight.
ThirdyDot::It's virtually KD vs Howard but Howard obviously is the more efficient of the two.
Aktion Pak::this what separates lebron from durant; durant like melo and kobe doesn't trust his teammates
Keith::i suggest the westbrook haters simply do not pay any attention to thunder games, because russell is not going anywhere.  whether you like it or not, this team is built around durant and westbrook. take it or leave it.
