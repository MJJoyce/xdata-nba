cardinalsballer23::great game by the cavs. showing those young legs with all that hustle...cleveland out-hustles every team in the NBA. no questions asked.
jank6708::Thanks Irving &amp; Cavs for putting Rubio &amp; the wolves into the 8th seed
cardinalsballer23::haha shouldnt that be love &amp; the wolves bro?
ClevelandsPOWND::For now
nygiants731::lol the chicken nuggets lost to the cavs cavs r doin the stanky leg cuz they won!!!!
jayeteee::What's even funnier is, you make fun of the Nuggets and your Knicks are a much more inferior team. Typical Knicks ________.
bmosheman::Irving was a stud and CLE played well enough to win.  Kudos to them.  But Denver played like @ss and I'm still fuming at the indifference they showed.
Pusherman3::No D in enver last night
The Land of Cleve::No O in Denver either... ever
c5a1t3s::...#1 in ppg don't let stats interfere with your argument, though.
swoosh212396::Kyrie is boy magic! First the Celtics game last second layup. And then last second free throws made against Kings to win now this!! Hes boy wonder! GO CAVS!
dcreery15::wat ppl don't get about knicks is that the problem is ther defense, lin shump walker jeffries and chandler is way better then lin fields carmelo stat and  chandler  more on that here http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
swoosh212396::This isnt even bout the Knicks! this bout Kyrie boy magic!!
Impounded216::if it had been lebron in the same situation he would slowly dribbled down the court and passed the ball at the last second. Kyrie has that killer instinct something lebron has never had.
brutang77::KYRIE THE CLUTCH KID!
eototal::Way to go Cavs!!! Wolves nation thanks you.
sillerdu44::I think this is Kyrie's 3rd game winning shot while his team is trailing in the last 10 seconds.   Anyone know where to find stats on this type of thing?
DannyMejia15MVP::I feel most sorry for Ty Lawson3. It was his birthday
DannyMejia15MVP::I guess we didn't take the Cavs very seriously which is why we lost, Good Luck to the Cavs for the rest of the year
cardinalsballer23::why is it that everytime someone's favorite team loses to a lesser team the reason is always because they didnt take them seriously? cant it just be the fact that the cavs out hustle every team they play?i hate the fact that people think the cavs suck because they have a lot of young, raw talent and they just havent fully developed yet.
ryanvdonk::if you watched the nuggets you would have seen the huge difference in focus in this game vs. the ones they play well in.  they have had a big problem with this all year.  also a bit of rust on nene getting in the flow of the offense and defense (he was awful on that end).  additionally, gallo still looks not 100%, but he was better than last game at least.
jayeteee::For some reason, and I can't for the life of me figure out why, but the Nuggets act like if they just show up at home, they'll win the game. 11-9 says that's not the case. Maybe somebody should inform the home team. Hey, George, do something productive for once.
DetKoolAid::first espn doesnt show stuckeys crossover on kobe and now they dont show Gee's dunk???
cardinalsballer23::that dunk was SICK!!! better than denver's so called "manimal"
Nuggsdip4life::Where was faried at the end? He would have stopped (girl name I don't know) Irving.
cardinalsballer23::well, me being a cavs fan, i dont think faried could have stopped kyrie. rondo couldnt, and hes one of THE best deffenders in the league.
jayeteee::Man, Nuggsdip4life, you beat me to the punch. The correct answer is, "Because George Karl is an idiot."
billymitch14::He can't stop himself at the end of the game which is why he wasn't there let alone a 19 yr old who may be one of the best closers in the game,
Nuggsdip4life::They get in shape by playing in the 1st half not the last most important minutes of the game.
diehardnr1::GK trying to out genius himself again!   Wants his starters back in game shape and figured Cavs would fold I guess... All I know is Faried closing last 4 games = 4 Ws...like my grandpa says..." IF IT AINT BROKE THEN DON'T FIX IT!"
MileHighFan9::Fun fact Denver is actually 0-40
diehardnr1::I like cheese
diehardnr1::nacho cheese
MileHighFan9::.
prezh601::Affalo needs to give some of his game check back after the way he defended the rookie down at the end of the game.. I thought that you were a defensive guy.. and that is the 2nd time Bird man has been dunked on in the last week... tim duncan was unacceptable.. Alonzo GEE has great Hops.. if he can establish a jumper and a hald court game..and work on that defense SON.. cleveland may have themselves a Hooper..
cardinalsballer23::Gee's got some moves but sometimes he does a little too much and winds up getting himself in bad situations.
B.Baker.24::He can shoot the three not to mention he averages 2 steals a game.
diehardnr1::agree on AAA....but blame Karl more for not having Faried in to close out the game
NBA_refs_are_weak::jamison has been ballin lately. if the cavs were lookin to move him, now would be the time. a team like the lakers might jump the gun and give up more than they should. maybe even the celtics, although idk what we have to really offer
MileHighFan9::Nuggets will never win again ever! I'm always right about these things it seems i mean they havent won a game all year
diehardnr1::Absolutely the worst game of the season for the Nuggets!  Lack of effort from beginning to end....kind of expecting to get bailed out late apparently.  Apparently, Nene is Portuguese for Burnt Marshmallow....7' beast who thinks he's a matador, or worse, a Ferdinand...and always during crunch time. Karls decision to go with Nene and Gallo to finish the game gets added to his impressive collection of horrible gut calls.    Its like this team can't stand success and is going to melancholy its way into another first round exit (IF they even make it that far!)  TOO MUCH TALENT TO BE THIS APATHETIC.....if you can't win the "easy" games at home then you may as well pack it up...Get your heads out Boyz (read AlH, AAA, Brewer, Nene) before its too late!  GO NUGGETS!!!
ryanvdonk::first lost to the eastern conference this year...
diehardnr1::ps...  Is it just me or do the Nuggz seem to get more "home calls" when they are on the road than they do in The Can?   Just seems like every 50-50 call goes to the visiting team....any thoughts?
Impounded216::yea i got a thought about the calls... cry me a river.
hillbilly344::Wow.......Cleveland won over the Nuggets..........    Kyrie pretty legit!!
Kamikazi02::Guys are just standing around watching Kyle Irving doing lay ups... Please nuggets do something about it.
cardinalsballer23::its not only them watching kyrie do lay-ups but what about antawn jamison with 26 points in the first half? ouch...
1mproperDancing::I remember Kyrie's first handful of games he was getting blocked constantly as he got a feel for what he needed to do to get around NBA big men.  Once he cracked that code, he became damn near impossible to block.
quickbr0wnf0x::Yes those double clutches, underneath shots, and acrobatic body-controlled leaps are not easy to defend.  The weren't just plain vanilla layups, they are designed to go around defenses.
1mproperDancing::It looked like they were trying to do something.  Irving just has too much body control and can finish shots with both hands.  That's tough to guard.
JustineS04::Jamison for Nene and Miller. Please? Throw in a pick if necessary.
JustineS04::Nene plays with the intensity of your average houseplant.
ryanvdonk::he's a good 1 on 1 defender, unfortunately he learned his help defense from melo
quickbr0wnf0x::Nene is not the problem.
diehardnr1::yeah....a $$13Million/year houseplant
trasch_man::Also has hair resembling one
JustineS04::Good game Cavs. You showed focus throughout.
JustineS04::Wow, Nuggets came down with a serious case of the Idontgiveafux.
i liked this comment::so did byron put firecrackers up everybody's a zz to get this win???
cardinalsballer23::no im pretty sure that the cavs out-hustle just about every single team in the NBA
1mproperDancing::Whatever works, right?
Betterwithoutmelo::Carmelo Anthony thinks the Nuggets are playing sucky defense.
ryensgin::Which play will be #1 on the not top ten?  Gee's dunk with Gallo hangin on the rim or nick young's amazing fastbreak layup against la tonight?
MavsNation92::I really thought Denver would win this game
MileHighFan9::Its time for Denver to trade every $@%!$@% one and start over
cardinalsballer23::i like how everyone is blaming george karl. i mean the guy is one of the most successful coaches of all time. maybe a little lack of effort by your team but thats just my thoughts...
quickbr0wnf0x::Denver has a lot of good pieces -- no team is going to win every night!
1mproperDancing::I think you Denver fans are going a little overboard here.  Karl is a solid coach and your team is pretty good despite having a ton of injuries this season.
diehardnr1::maybe just one....named George?
JustineS04::Little alarmist, no?
RayKrebbs1978::They looked good tonight.  Hopefully they got over the rough patch.  Friday will not be easy though.  Check this out - http://www.lakecounty-sentinel.com/index.php?p=51_35
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Well, Cavs show some more promise. Another step forward - but only a step in the miles long journey. Have a GOOD night, everybody!
1mproperDancing::I'm just glad they avoided a ten game losing streak.  I'm fine with them losing games this season, but ten in a row always hurts even when you're gunning for the high lottery picks.
goosu123::Good Night
MileHighFan9::.$@%! the Nuggets and all their players!
quickbr0wnf0x::You're insane.  There is a lot to like about the Nuggets team.
DyersEve06::Stuart Scott just mispronounced Alonzo Gee's last name.  Weak sauce....no respect for the Cavs.
DyersEve06::Say it like "Geek", instead of "Jeep".  Hard G
1mproperDancing::Or "3G Service."
quickbr0wnf0x::Yes, like "Gee whiz, that was an awesome dunk!"
1mproperDancing::It's actually a soft G.
tommyboyunm::How do you screw up "Gee"? Haha.
DyersEve06::He also said "Danilo Gallinaro" so maybe he's drunk or something.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::They've all screwed up names. A foul, but not a technical/flagrant one.
DyersEve06::Should be in the top 10....find out in about 2 seconds
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::They didn't? I shoulda put money on it. I KNEW they'd ignore it.
DyersEve06::Actually, the bigger foul was not showing his big dunk over Faried and Anderson.
Rengel12::I was about to Tweet something to him about it.. What an idiot
MileHighFan9::Nuggets are the worst $@%!$@% team in the league and the wolves will win the finals. where are the nugget fans ? oh yeah they dont have any
eototal::Nice try at being a "Wolves" Fan.
JustineS04::Don't forget to take your prozac tonight.
MileHighFan9::I think its time the Nuggets owners sell the team and be done with it, its over folks nothing more to see.
The Land of Cleve::Seattle needs a team
Kirchhoffs Law::LOL Denver sucks, proven tonight.
ricksiter9::No, i think it was the "attitude".
The Land of Cleve::I think the altitude got to them
BroncsAvsRocksNuggs::Not to take anything away from the Cavs.. but the Nuggets will make any team look good on offense.... their defense is just awful... they have some good hustle plays and decent rebounding which make they look a lot better then they are...  but their perimeter D and penetration help is non existent.. the proof is in the puddin... 102 points points allowed per game...  sounds like another George Karl team is right on track for another loss in the playoffs!
quickbr0wnf0x::Not sure why everyone thinks the Nuggets don't play D.  Some of those hard traps on the pick and rolls resulted in turnovers, and they played a lot of "in your face" aggressive defense.
1mproperDancing::Feel free to take a little away from the Cavs.  It's not like they're some elite team this year.  They're bad (especially with Varejao out) and just had a really good night last night.  It happens.  Still, happy to see them net a win and avoid the ten game losing streak.
JustineS04::Nuggs cannot execute two consecutive switches to save their lives.
yata9arasu::Good night everyone!  KYRIE IRVING=CLUTCH!  GO CAVS!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::'Night, yata!
Rengel12::I want Jeremy Lamb from Uconn in a Cavaliers uniform next year.
navyctr312::me too!
navyslson1::I have a bad feeling with Barns..
DyersEve06::From what I've read, Chris Grant and the Cavs brass are all about Harrison Barnes.  Supposedly they would have drafted him number one if he had come out.  Hopefully they can figure out a way to get him.
1mproperDancing::No kidding.  Then it's just a matter of finding a two-guard who can score 15-20 a night and a starting caliber SF.  I doubt the Cavs will be lucky enough to win the lottery twice in a row, but you never know.
DyersEve06::I think the Bulls won the draft lottery with like the 8th worst record.  That would be ridiculous if we did...welcome Anthony Davis.
goosu123::Either way, he just doesn't impress me. He never seemed that great in the season before when the team was less talented. We wouldn't need a losing streak, just a lucky draw. Remember we get Kyrie off of a pick that had a 1% chance to win. Hopefully if we are in that situation, we take someone else. I think T-Rob or Davis would be much better picks if we get a good draw.
DyersEve06::Some analysts seem to think that Barnes will be a better pro...just because he's not expected to do anything but score for that loaded UNC team.  He doesn't need to rebound or pass, just score.  And yeah, it would take a big losing streak or some sort of trade for us to get him, I realize that.
Rengel12::I dont see how we will be able to get Barnes though.
goosu123::Kyrie was different, I really favored him over DW. In fact I argued many times with the people who wanted the DW, Kemba combo. Barnes just strikes me as a bust. He isn't great passer, he isn't a great defender, or that good of a rebounder. He can score, but I wouldn't really consider him someone who is great at making his own shot. Plus, he doesn't strike me as a passionate player. But who knows, maybe he'll prove me wrong if they pick him.
DyersEve06::Maybe, but Grant has made some pretty good decisions so far.  Not everyone was sold on Kyrie either.  Barnes and Irving are friends already, so maybe bringing him in would have the added bonus of keeping Kyrie here too.
goosu123::ugh, I don't like Barnes. He has bust written all over him.
goosu123::Another scorer/ball handler is always nice. Biel from UF is another option at SG. Honestly, I think I would rather see them pick a Big though.
KingGeorge53::Would be a nice addition.
venator360::Irving=clutch. He's got a bright future. Cavs need to get some more talent around him.
DyersEve06::Let's be honest: they should sit Andy for as long as possible and start trading the vets.  Then we'll have a better chance at a top 3 pick.  And why not give Manny Harris some more run?
The Land of Cleve::I don't know why everyone says flip sessions.  He's an excellent player, it would be awesome to have him as a backup PG
DyersEve06::They would get torched by opposing guards.  This is Kyrie's team anyway.
The Land of Cleve::What about if he played the 1 and Kyrie started playing the 2?  Irving is better at scoring, and Sessions is a better ball handler.
DyersEve06::He's not going to exercise his option just to backup Kyrie.  That's why people want to trade him.  Plus he actually has some value.   It's a Dwight Howard situation...may as well trade him and get some value because he's leaving anyways.
yata9arasu::He won't stay because he deserves to start.  I would keep him if he agreed to an extension....
DyersEve06::Gotta get another good player in this draft, flip Sessions and Jamison for something useful, and then take advantage of the massive cap space they'll have.
navyslson1::Around #8, probably.
The Land of Cleve::we should get a good draft pick this year
ndorow25::Can anyone tell me why Stern was in Denver before the game?
ndorow25::^^^one day maybe...
The Land of Cleve::To watch the irvmaster play
BroncsAvsRocksNuggs::in the recap it says he was vacationing (skiing) in Colorado..
ndorow25::Ah ok, I only briefly skimmed the recap and noticed the picture. Thanks
navyslson1::How funny of a thought is that.... Stern skiing!
BroncsAvsRocksNuggs::I only got to watch half of the last quarter of this game... not too surprising... Nuggets still have a ways to go before they want to compete... with Nene and Gallo both coming back from injuries the chemistry is not there at all... Only so many buzzer beaters you can pull off before it comes back to bite you.. Cavs just wanted the win more tonight... First time I've got to watch Irving in the NBA... he is legit.
The Land of Cleve::Cavs had lost 6 straight, damn right they wanted to win
DyersEve06::Cavs need to bust out some gold jerseys with wine stitching.
Impounded216::teams seem to change unis ever few years now and hell they have like 5 of them they can pick from.
Stainless Steel City 6x::I miss the blue and orange unis.
The Land of Cleve::bring back the blue and orange!
DyersEve06::I like those alternates they used a few times also.
DyersEve06::I don't mind the white ones but I can't stand the wine ones.  I guess they wanted a change to help move away from the Lebron era.  Which is understandable.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Not changing them would've sent the message that the team was bigger than the player.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I hate the current unis. I wish they didn't change them after 7/8/2010.
Slom26::one thing i was thinking about, which team (cavs or nuggets) ended up in a better situation after their superstar left or forced their way out with a trade? conventional wisdom is the nuggets because they received some nice young talent and actually got something in return. however, by cleveland sucking so bad, they were able to get kyrie irving, who is probably already better than everyone on the nuggets. it is fact that in the nba you gnereally need a superstar to win a title. i think the nuggets, by acquiring talent in return, perhaps put themselves in the cycle of mediocrity and will continuously be a second tier team. while the cavs, on the other hand, have a better long term chance of building a championship team because they were able to get a superstar talent in the draft. anyone agree?
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Gears meet wrench: 2004 Pistons.
KingGeorge53::time will tell, but I like the Nuggets team and they may have a couple stars on this team already.
Slom26::a superstar? i think they have second tier stars. i see another atlanta hawks in the making
auetao::zozo is an illegal or welfare warriior
zosoMC::Judging by your grasp of basic English, I'd have to say you were one or the other.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Zeppelin reference?
zabueteen0606::Whats the difference between Lebron and Kyrie? The 4th Quarter.
gary wheatley::i would hate to be the nuggets at practice tomorrow.  lot of butt chewing and mulling over what happened tonite.  Although in Karls speech to the press he said it was EVERYBODYS fault including him.  He said everyone was accountable tonite.  It was not a happy scene in that locker room after the game as it shouldnt have been happy.  Hope this is a wakeup call.  Not saying Cleveland is a bad team it just proves if youre not ready to play anybody can beat anyone.  The Lakers lost tonight in Washington after being up by 21.  It just shows that you better have your game face on every nite or this is what is gonna happen.
JustineS04::George Karl showed emotion? Stop the presses!
