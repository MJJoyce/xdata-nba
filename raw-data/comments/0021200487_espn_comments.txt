8723Chris::Been using a bet system called sportsbettingstar. ive made 3k a month the past 3 months straight using this system. you can find the system online by searching for sports betting systems.
steeleute::GG Suns, it was nice to see the Jazz play a complete road game and do it short handed as well
BANKROBBA2020::Suns going to miss the playoffs for 3rd straight year! HATE!!
lostjazzfan::well hopefully your FO can get some good draft picks.
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::We should be 19-15 if we didn't get screwed by the refs twice vs. the clippers. just sayin
LeBron Owns Hondo::yes
Sun Devils-Suns-Cardinals-Diamondbacks-Sun Devils::As many of you know,I have posted the message"Spurs fans suck." many times. So why do I hate the Spurs? Because my Phoenix Suns got SCREWED in 2007. That Amare suspension was totally unfair and unwarranted and it cost the Suns the key game of that series,game 5. It was totally unfair and unwarranted and it may well have cost the Suns the 2007 NBA Championship. After 2007,being a Suns fan gives me no choice but to hate the Spurs.
lostjazzfan::haha "Laces out Dan" Sounds like this guy has Ray Finkle Syndrome.  As a Jazz fan I completely get it though.  We got screwed in the finals in the mid 90's.
jawn01::Even this suns fan says its time to let it go. Yes it sucked and stern screwed the suns but there was no guarantee the suns win that series even w/o the suspension and even if they did, they still would have had to have won series against a gritty Jazz team and against Lebron in the finals. Granted the suns would have been favored heavily over both but still upsets can happen. Anyways I'd be more concerned about the 2013 version of the suns and their continued mediocrity and inability to make the playoffs when at least half the league does so. THAT would concern me way more than the screw job of 2007.
Darkflame07::You gotta let that go dude.......
didyougetthememookur::The Spurs are spurs in the sides of many teams.  Matt Bonner is the best player to ever play the game.
mikeisildur::Is this an automated thing or does someone actually take the time to pointlessly copypaste this exact post onto every Suns board?
rengland123::The Suns need Tracy Mcgrady
backoff5736::lol here comes phx
vegasneverloses::suns going to win
vegasneverloses::next year
jawn01::A very common saying in Phoenix regarding the suns. Heck same applied to the AZ cards too.
AllGoodThingsCometo_anEnd::Phoenix suns sucks so bad  incredible
vegasneverloses::here we come ,,, come on suns win
Never Trust A Man Who Sleeps In A Hat::Hayward should get more rebounds for someone thats 6'8
JPHoks1981::Look at where he is on the floor hes on the permiter and he runs after the shot like told, hes not going to get rebounds.
wingerisgreat@gmail.com::Just an off night
Never Trust A Man Who Sleeps In A Hat::Nahh, he never really gets rebounds though
vegasneverloses::4 points ?
backoff5736::kevin bacon sux
Never Trust A Man Who Sleeps In A Hat::The Air Up There is the greatest sposts movie of all time
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Well well.
scow79::Let me guess?   You lost money on this game?
vegasneverloses::what a gay nic lol
vegasneverloses::your nic is a waste
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::So's your face.
vegasneverloses::comon suns
Alxbakari::Bad bad phoenix suns... What a waste!!
vegasneverloses::dam there bad
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=bkcyc5m  I'm just bored.
Tyler BarnesMNSports::Meow
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::roof
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::GRRRR
Tyler BarnesMNSports::Meow
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::We have the 3rd easiest schedule remaining in the west so sitting at .500 right now is not that bad if you ask me.
Never Trust A Man Who Sleeps In A Hat::If they make the playoffs, I hope they get the Clippers in the first round
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::Burks' defense alone should be the reason he plays over watson
wingerisgreat@gmail.com::Where is kanter?
wingerisgreat@gmail.com::Dang he's been good recently
scow79::Sprained ankle
scow79::I like seeing Favors directing the defense out there.
Never Trust A Man Who Sleeps In A Hat::Reminds me alot of KG the way he can control everything
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::Sorry but no one can convince me that Watson is better than Burks lol
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yeah, that was a ridiculous statement.
lookitsdeco::in other news milwaukee is garbage juice
scow79::That's why we like Burks so much
lookitsdeco::utah always has a strong third quarter
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Always?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::It's almost impressive how bad Jefferson is at D. Like, it's so bad that it has to take effort. He has to try to be that bad.
backoff5736::cmon phx get back in this yessssssssss
Josh4Jazz::I don't get why everyone is so hyped on burks... H doesn't seem that good
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Burks is 21 and he shows he can get to the rim and finish. I will be on the Burks bandwagon until he is given the minutes, fails, and gives me reason to get off.
scow79::Ditto.  When he gets minutes and fails, then I'll agree that he isn't that great.
Josh4Jazz::I mean, burks isn't bad, but I've seen him make a lot of silly mistakes this game, and if his free throw percentage is as low as the announcers say, I don't see how he is a better option right now,
JPHoks1981::I agree with you Josh
Josh4Jazz::I disagree. Watson may not be the best shooter but he handles the ball well and gets the offense rolling. Did you see him in the first half?
Never Trust A Man Who Sleeps In A Hat::No he doesn't, he usually dribbles it to half court and picks it up and gets in trouble needing Hayward/one of the bigs to ron out to him for a hand off. Telfair can make anybody look good
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::because anyone is better than watson
backoff5736::lol cmon phx get this to single digits for 4t q
NOSUCHTHINGASALOCK::a&amp;m starting to smack  oaklahoma
mikeisildur::Too bad, it's been fun watching the SEC get smacked around.  Oh well, not super fond of Oklahoma either.
scow79::You might be on the wrong board
capnchuc::shame on you Hayward
JPHoks1981::Ugh that pissed me off cuz im a Hayward guzzler but he did come back and hit a few jumpers.
scow79::Redeemed himself
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Ridiculous.
Tmac1912::Yes the Suns are awful. Keep failing so we can get a top five pick please. I want Boatright from Uconn
NOSUCHTHINGASALOCK::wow. suns now have 21 points in the last 20 minutes of play.  poor suns fans. u have my sympathies having to root for a PAL basketball team
backoff5736::cmon phx hang tough
backoff5736::lol better then phx
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By86PcLufOU
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::This board is as active as Jefferson's defense.
mikeisildur::If only he could guard Duncan every night.  Remember when he got a steal and ran across the court for a dunk?  Probably the only guy in the league Jefferson can do that too.
capnchuc::This game is really boring :(
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Dudley-do-wrong, eh?
backoff5736::alright here we go phx cmon get this
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::LOL. Ha! That was hilarious.
backoff5736::wtf phx are you really this bad

Red32x::yes
capnchuc::Well  crap now that Foye has made a jumpshot Burks won't see another minute tonight
jesseisbomb::me too! burks foye hayward milsap and favors is the dream lineup
scow79::I liked seeing Burks at the 1
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::You could remove "at the 1" and that sentence still works.
Slackzak::why is  this game in gold?
JoakimNoahforMVP::that means its one of your favorite teams smarts
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::"This is two bad teams."  - Barkley
backoff5736::here comes another barn burner quarter come on phx
JoakimNoahforMVP::why is phoenix so bad?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Goran Dragic is their best player.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Well, I wouldn't go that far. He's a solid player, but if he's your best player, you're in trouble.
JoakimNoahforMVP::true. he sucks more than scalabrine
Alxbakari::Oooh shiiit, how did Jazz end up leading... lat time i checked Suns were up by 8.. Damnnnn u Phoenix Suns, damnnn u!!
jesseisbomb::yep as soon as the starters get the floor
capnchuc::But don't worry your 10 point lead will be back up in just a few minutes
jesseisbomb::hah the jazz played a thing called defense and they got back in the game so theres your answer!!
Aliens Colonial Marines AZ::Question-So who will be the cardinals next head coach?
Aliens Colonial Marines AZ::Oh against the redskins I feel ya man I was rooting for the boys secretly ;)
jesseisbomb::yah it makes me mad! the boys cant even finish a dang season! they had it in their hands!
gao808::Dennis Green
Aliens Colonial Marines AZ::Lol cardinals have gotten the best of the Dallas and Arizona match up latly
jesseisbomb::come on! we all know the cowboys are where its at!!!! ha who am i kiddin?
Aliens Colonial Marines AZ::No no no jesse
jesseisbomb::who cares who the cardinals new coach is?! they still wont win!!!
Aliens Colonial Marines AZ::Ewww lol
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Buddy Ryan
Aliens Colonial Marines AZ::You really thank that? Would you like that? Rather than horton
gao808::Todd Haley
NOSUCHTHINGASALOCK::9 points?  how does a major league basketball team score 9 points in a quarter. it boggles the mind
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::DOMINATING JAZZ D!!!!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Brooklyn and Washington tied at 113 in 2OT. Ha.
gao808::Hello NBA!  Contraction is a necessity if there are teams that can't even score double digit points in one quarter.  The lack of talent that's on the court on a daily basis is pathetic.  Your brand is being diminished very quickly.
gao808::Where was that defense in the 1st quarter when the Suns put up 31?  Tremors is awesome BTW.  Another example of how bad the NBA is any 2 minute clip from today's Kings-Raptors game, if you can bear to watch.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Can't score on that dominating Jazz defense!
