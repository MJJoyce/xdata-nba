Cyril::Makes sense to play Humphries a little more tonight.  The biggest knock on him is his defense, and most nights you don't have to worry too much about Kenneth Faried or Darrell Arthur going off.
brian::Remember last years triple OT thriller at the garden vs Nuggets during that big blizzard? Probably the best game of the year for the Celtics last year.
pablo::Any video game players here?  Anyone know if there is a "supersim" mode in NBA 2K14 for XBox 360?  The NFL and MLB games let you simulate to the end of games in franchise mode, and then play the end (or any other part) of the game.  The old NBA 2Ks don't give you that option.  Trying to decide if I should buy it or not, that would pretty much be the only reason so I don't have to play entire games in franchise mode lol.  Thanks
William::We need to keep improving. Lets see the turnovers go down and control the glass. Lets keep improving on the assist ratio and keep using depth as a factor. The bench is becoming bid for us. We are ten deep with contributions from everyone. Now we just need a real leader to step up and lead! Go Celts!!!
delbert::Denver should let Mozgov get a lil more run. He seems to do good when he does play...
John::Too many 3's, two, three steps in hit a two better than a miss or drive to the basket good things happen. (draw a foul)
LU::Congratulate on coach stevens for winning the " coach of the year " award !
CB 25::Wilson Chandler, hit the gym man!!!
Roy Mustang::the celtics need to dump humphries and his huge contract. the same with keith bogans. and if wallace doesn't find a groove soon send him packing too. that is $27 million on those three players. they can get more bang for their buck elsewhere.
bbb::Is Kelly Olynyk playin tomorrow?
