Ngoo Nam::Eng e there is correct.  Love needs loads of support, no matter how powerful Love is.
Dan::T-Wolves just can't seem get over the .500 hump and are now 2-6 in the second game of back to backs. Rubio and Brewers a combined 3-19 from the floor. Pitiful. Those two need to be more pull their collective heads out and be consistent if the T-Wolves are going to make noise in the West.
Cyril::Kevin Love has got to realize that not every three-point attempt is a good idea. He was launching them so quickly tonight that half the time he didn't even have his feet set and the defender was up in his chest.  He has won some games for them with his outside shooting, but he's lost just as many by trying to shoot himself out of a slump.
Anton::Kevin Love isn't really that great. He lives by the 3 and dies by the 3. For supposedly big man MVP, he has no post moves (even Dwight has some), he is a terrible defender, a bum shot blocker. This game is clear evidence that Love is so overrated. He pads his stats but he cannot win games (no playoffs ever in his life) and he does not make his teammates better. That is not a superstar, that is a pretender.
Ariel::To Jeff Green. Since the injury of Rondo, the Celtics nation expected you to be the leader of the team and to be the focal point of offense. But you were very inconsistent and less aggressive. Sad to say, this is Jared Sullinger's team now until Rondo returns.
The Genius::Both Love and Sullinger are horrible. Duncan and Dirk are still the best PF's in money time.
Bob::hope anton gets diagnosed with stage 4 cancer tomorrow and dies the next day.
EIGHT::Sully is a beast!! Steal of the draft last year
PKM::11-14 First Place!
Amir::Wolves will see playoffs  if they somehow move to Eastern conference ,Rubio was best Celtics player tonight, his offensive anti-talent is unbelievable.
