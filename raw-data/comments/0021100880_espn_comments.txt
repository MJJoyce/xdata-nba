teddyt115::I don't get Skiles. The rotation is so up and down. He's going to burn out Ellis and Jennings this year. Our top 3 bench guys didn't get over 20 minutes?
Deuce200361::The Pistons need to just keep losing the rest of their games so that they have at least a shot at lottery miracle.  They is no interest in Detroit for them now whatsoever.   Mainly because of their coach who nobody wanted here
bamberg1977::I think a lot of people like the coach. Pistons have a first year coach and several new players so they got off to a horrible start.   But honestly, looking at the rosters of these two teams, I'd much rather have the Pistons future. I think the Pistons are better than milwaukee right now, they have a better record the last several months of the season.   I agree its time to start losing games though.
one way21::catch philly play them for 8th spot
one way21::bucks will make playoff
New_York_For_The_Win::Only 150 comment really?????????????????????????? Oh well, two teams that don't have fans at all
Michaelprestby65::Ive been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar for a few months now. I have made over 3k a month for 3 consecutive months just following this system.

surfzone365::As much as I would love to see the Bulls torment the Knicks yet again in a playoff series, it would be fun to see Milwaukee in the race.  Go Bucks, hope you get in!
BigBasketBallz::I want the Knicks, 76ers would be a boring series..Bucks would be interesting I would definitely buy tickets in Milwaukee to watch the Bulls lol
Madhouse_United::I want to face the Knicks. It's always a good series. 6-1 in our favor though. The 1 being due to THAT call in 94.
