jayeteee::@xNiKKiBaByxo   No, I do. :)  I listened to this game on the radio and the Nuggets got lucky. When is the issue going to be that the coach really has no clue?
xNiKKiBaByxo::No, I got last comment. xD
soloartist11::That's right Cawks fans... NUGGETS!!! Last Comment lol
CandySparker::Hawks Lotta Love!
crazycucker2::thunder denied ibaka and harden for howard.... that would have been a crazy good team http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
Souri98::Why doesn't Josh Smith plays like that every game, he'll be unstoppable.
Coldhard facts::Are you kidding me, although Joe Johnson did play well THIS game, the fact is that he is not performing. He and any sane person knows that he is getting over-paid and his game is certainly NOT worth what he is getting paid.
Celtics17Banners::Thank you Nuggets.
Slurm Soda::edit
greg94327::Joe Johnson so underrated, worth his contract if you dont think so you're a moron.
Brando Tolberto::Greg that is a moronic statement. Joe is not wirth his contract. Your an idiot. Guys like Kobe make that money. Dont be so foolish.
alexshmalix::how much are they paying him?
greg94327::not enough
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::lynx baby
nuggetsRulz::nope, just baby.
MileHighFan9::Denver_Fan_15 is like a bad version of me, but i don't bash good players when they're playing well
Slurm Soda::I still don't think you're even a Nuggets fan, but he makes it to obvious.
soloartist11::Uh huh
MileHighFan9::I am i really am. He's a angry knicks fan under a Denver name..
THE AMAZING CHEF aHAHA::WOW GOOD WIN NUGGETS WHAT A GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
Slurm Soda::?
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::denver trolling on their own board lol
THE AMAZING CHEF aHAHA::JABBA TEXT ME
nuggetsRulz::you would know.
MileHighFan9::i dont always like my own comments.... But...
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::gotta love the same comeback everytime -- wait, there are a couple more  nice pic wolves are above .500???? (don't really understamd that one) you live in mn  always the same lol
MileHighFan9::JabbaTroll_Nothingbettertodo_MN
sharkboy2421::he is pretty irate right now
MileHighFan9::He should pay attention to the Wolves and their .500 ways
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::@slurm soda  did you hear magic owner tell dwight that if he stays he can decide van gundy's and the gms future?
Slurm Soda::Damn no I didn't hear that. I think he likes Van Gundy though, but Dwight isn't the 1st guy I would want to pick coaches and GMs haha
Slurm Soda::The Warriors were dumb for doing that I think
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::yeah, gonna be interesting to see what happens now they aren't gettin monta
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::guarentee i know more about nba/nfl than you 2 clowns
alexshmalix::what does mn have to do with this game. and besides, its now over for the wolves,they're still well in the race.
sharkboy2421::Yeah put that on your resume you loser
sty34::haha i like
nuggetsRulz::right up there with his poster of the MN lakers
nuggetsRulz::sure you do sports guru, especially with all that success in MN.
nuggetsRulz::No I don't. Are you counting titles that have never happened or never will?
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::you count titles that happened before you were born and WCF??????? LOL LYNX BABY
nuggetsRulz::well, combine the AVs and Broncos championships in the last 15 years, throw in the nuggest WCF and the rockies WS appearance, subtract anything from MN and you get.........
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::and all that success in denver huh
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::denver fans pretending to play nice after slamming hawk fans entire game... love it
nuggetsRulz::wolves fan pretending to know anything about the NBA after jumping on bangwagon .... love it more.
sharkboy2421::Yes... let the buthurt flow through you
sharkboy2421::Give it up for the highest scoring team in the Association!   gg Hawks fans, I hope you win against the Clippers. Wolves fans can suck it though
Slurm Soda::So did anyone hear Van Gundys post game press conference
MarcusXP50::Yea me too.....classic.
Slurm Soda::I like when reporters ask dumb questions and they get a response like Van Gundy gave them
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::lol you just saw it on espn? me too
Slurm Soda::haha yeah I'm watching SC
gary wheatley::does anyone else have a feeling that something is going to happen trade wise by the deadling other than the hopefully the wilson chandler signing.  take tonight for instance, kufos was still out and yet birdman didnt get into the game, and Mozzy played limited minutes.  Also I have a gut feeling Dre is part of something that is going to happen
gary wheatley::what is your gut feeling helmsey? think bird and dre is gone?
alexshmalix::dre has been i big part of some of the wins for denver. like in the ot win against the sixers. i think they should keep him.
helmsey::but he has been WAY too inconsistent.  he has 1 great game every 6 outings and 4 duds.  we need CONSISTENCY
sty34::amen to that trade him and mozgovs terrible ankles
helmsey::I hope Dre is part of that something.  He is just too old and slow with no defensive ability.  Does not work with out current lineup.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::lol sharkboy you need to melo out bro  just melo out
nuggetsRulz::nothing could 'melo' someone out more than an ACL tear. That person would probably be 'melo' for the rest of the season.
sharkboy2421::GOTTEM
sharkboy2421::LMAO YOU MAD?
Slurm Soda::I see your pun there
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::kiddy needs to learn to melo, your cool tho
MarcusXP50::Joe Johnson has to be the most overrated and overpaid player in NBA history.
MarcusXP50::I figured that by just watching his body language.
alexshmalix::nah, joe played well in this game. imo.
PKfalconshomer::You won't believe how much he is ripped on here in ATL - not a vocal leader and timid to show any passion - he is not well liked by us fans - well the few of us there are....
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::joe had a great game lol?
PKfalconshomer::Hawks lose - its Lebron's fault - that will make me feel better.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::i love your little list of worst fan bases, rippin on rubio is low -- think we kno where the worst fan base in the nba is lol
Slurm Soda::there
sharkboy2421::Thats what happens when you tear your ACL. You can't form a coherent sentence.
sharkboy2421::Chill bro youre acting like your ACL is torn
nuggetsRulz::why are you here?
gary wheatley::has anyone heard any kind of latest news on Wilson Chandler
MarcusXP50::He is......wait till we get a new coach.
MarcusXP50::You fools act like Wilson Chandler is the second coming of Scottie Pippen.........BWAHA HA HAHA
Slurm Soda::You fools acted like Melo was the savior of the Knicks .BWAHA HA HAHA
sharkboy2421::Hes in Denver and ready to play as soon as a deal goes through. If he does sign, which it looks like he will, it will happen by friday
I have popcorn in my ears::I know the front office really wants to hammer this out - and they've done a great job so far.  The Melo deal, Gallo's extension, AAA and Nene - I have faith that he'll be on the court soon!
gary wheatley::boy I hope he does.  another good offensive wepon in the arsenal.  He is a good defender.  I still think something else is going to go down.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::Btw it isn't bandwagoning if you're team is the worst in the nba for 5 years and you don't feel like embarrasing yourself.  Being .500 team just made us all excited again, we never cheered for other teams
alexshmalix::anybody who supports another team outside of their state (if their state has a team) they're what i consider cheating. loyalty is a big part of being a true fan.
ChiGuy1002::It's perfectly fine to admire another team that you respect as long as it doesn't interfere with your loyalty towards your first love team.
nuggetsRulz::is that a new rule? I guess wolves fans can be dick wads for life.
rr2300::wow didnt know we came back to win it... turned it off after we were just giving the game away like usual in the 4th quarter... I dream of a josh smith trade for the nuggets...
maxfactor233::It's funny/sad that NBA refs are sooo inconsistent and bad that after every game both teams feel like they got screwed.  I'm not sure how to fix it but they could start by not calling the flop, that play kills me.
Michael70532::Night Everyone Good win tonight!
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::denver fans just need to melo out...  lol
sharkboy2421::My ACL isn't torn... I'm chill man.
nuggetsRulz::wolves fans need to tear their ACL.....oh wait.
sharkboy2421::we just won and were 24-19, not 22-21  we chillin
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::you dont sound chill bro
PKfalconshomer::Ok - good win Nuggets - but this game actually is pi$$ing me off.  Up 6 in regulation, up 5 in OT with about a minute to go - JJ turns it over twice at crucial times, Pargo can't catch a ball, Hinrich misses a FT, JS fouls out - credit the Nuggets for not giving up - but honestly we gave this game away on our mistakes - mind numbing - we are 2 - 3 on this road trip and lost the 3 games on the road by a combined 5 points because we don't know or don't have the ability to finish - life as an ATL fan of all sports - just pi$$es me off because I remain loyal.....tomorrow is another day.....
alexshmalix::its true. i dont know if you watched the game or watched the highlights to the nuggets kings game, the exact thing happened. hawks had a controlling lead in ot...
Michael70532::Hawks suck
Michael70532::We were up 9 at half we blew it
sharkboy2421::"So what's with denver hating wolves so bad?"  Uhh, its you we hate dumb f**k
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::lol, whatido
nuggetsRulz::why are you here?
I have popcorn in my ears::http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/knicks/post/_/id/14169/stats-nyk-scoring-defending-better-wout-melo
Slurm Soda::It's funny to see people even trying to defend Melo anymore. Look at the top comment on that board and thats exactly what I think
I have popcorn in my ears::I don't know - look at the comments under that article...
nuggetsRulz::that number is getting smaller, even in NY
alexshmalix::gallo's 3pt shot should've been a game winner. ridiculous refs.
I have popcorn in my ears::The refs have been turrible ALL year.  Every game I have watched they have been dreadful...
gary wheatley::on the gallo 3 ball, did you see Pargo just totally wipe Nene out from the back.  blatent  foul  and  no call. unbelievable
MarcusXP50::Stop crying man....you won the game.
alexshmalix::how am i "crying" ?
burchboy21::Quit whining. Marvin Williams and Hinrich gave you guys the game. Take the win and shut up.
Slurm Soda::That was a reach in, but the way they were calling the game before that and then calling that  was really dumb
NBA_refs_are_weak::Look at the 4 bench players that got minutes for the hawks in this one lmao. Marvin williams, which is meh, but then check out this killer lineup : Pargo, Radmanovic (he still plays basketball) and ERIC DAMPIER LOL. sweet baby jesus just let me play for them, might as well. you dont even have to pay me, just pay for my travel costs and maybe a couple tickets to the game. good grief
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::So what's with denver hating wolves so bad?
Slurm Soda::We don't hate the Wolves, we hate the fans.
nuggetsRulz::funny how fans become $@%!$@ when their team suddenly doesn't suck as bad as it normally does.
nuggetsRulz::I don't, typical band wagon fans
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::yeah it's funny, how can you expect anything different?
maxfactor233::Don't hate the Wolves, just their fans.
maxfactor233::It just gets annoying when you're trying to talk to the fans of the team you're playing and a bunch of Wolves fans are clogging up the board with nonsense.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::ooooohhhhhhh ok, why? we gotta dumb fans, but every fan base does lol.
MarcusXP50::Everyone with half a brain knows that its not Melo's fault for the Knicks lackluster play but more a lack of coaching. D'antoni has got to go!!!!!!!!!
MarcusXP50::Thats because the syle of play with D'antoni.......Melo is shooting two many three's because of the system that the Knicks run.
nuggetsRulz::because of who he is, not the system.
nuggetsRulz::yes of course, couldn't be anything to do with melo and his 40% fgp.
nuggetsRulz::you are. 39 sounds much worse than 40, nice call.
I have popcorn in my ears::39%, but who's counting?
