Wallowinit::Bobcats actually must have read a scouting report - their transition D was much better than Orlando's in the previous game.  It is still very early but without Rondo the C's are an excellent fast break team, where Crawford's skills are best used, and a terrible half-court team.  Everybody knows you have to execute in the half-court to win in the playoffs.  This is where they really miss Rondo.  I think he wins them the 4th Q last night.
EIGHT::A young Celtics team in first after 8 games, and the Knicks in last. Who would have predicated that
bald eagle::Faverani is the only one on the Celtics with a plus ten, and the coach sits him the whole second half. What's with that.
Garrett::Why is it when the defender stands straight up and the offensive player falls, it's a foul? It's not just this game, but every game in the NBA. This is a RULE which states that if a defensive player is standing straight up, it shouldn't be a foul for the offensive player is initiating contact. Refs think "Oh he fell, it has to be a foul." In the 70's-80's, that's a play on and it should continue to be a play on.
Steve::Olynyk is going to be a very nice player.
Captain Carisma::Tough game without sully.
401K::I like the hornets getting 5 and a half points, should be a close game..
Phil M @ 11::Even after this loss, I still say that the Celts are going to the super bowl.
Raphael::What's the deal with Ben Gordon?? That dude used to light it up with the best of them!!!
Ryu::I just checked Bobcats stats, their PG's don't assist enough... their highest player Kemba Walker, does 4.7 assists per game... and what happened to Ben Gordon? He used to be a 20+ point per game player...
