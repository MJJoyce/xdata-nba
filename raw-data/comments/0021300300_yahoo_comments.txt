Chuck::As long as the Pistons can contain Josh Smith they'll win. Miami struggles with strong interior teams and they're missing 2 key perimeter contributors in Wade and Battier. I'm not counting Miami out by any means (any team with Lebron has a chance in any game) but with the way Drummond has played lately and what we know Monroe can do I think the matchup down low is too much for Miami. The flip side to this is if Drummond or Monroe get into foul trouble early the Heat will jump all over them. Should be entertaining.
Arkenauo::As a star in the team turnovers have to be limited. I still believe in the Heat Team. Go Lebron
Giovanni::Lebron is quite amazing. He shoots really well and gets a lot of points, but he also passes a lot.
Ronald::Drummond will be the best big man in NBA in a few years if he start polishing his offensive moves. He is an offensive machine on the glass already and I see him average 32 ppg 15 rebounds/game at his best. He will be a better FT than Shaq but this guy is very active on the glass and his defense is not bad either. I won't be surprised if he take his talent to South beach. If Lakers had Kareem and Magic......the Heat will have LBJ and Drummond.
CESAR::james jones is a great 3 point shooter, and his couch never put him, he plays only 2 or 3 minutes or never play, it is bad decision from the DT, Beasley is very good too, wade sucesor Heat got to beat pacers, and be champ again.
Guest::Wonder if Lebron will near a quad again tonight!!!
CSONKA_39::Josh Smith was a waste of money.
Jamar::I hope Miami Heat make it to the championship again..........
Matthew::3 TOs already?!?!? Jesus Christ, Brandon Jennings!
