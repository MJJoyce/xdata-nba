HIP2CLIP::That was fun. Gotta give it to the Mavs they put on a valiant effort before they fold up like a lawn chair late in the 4th but it sure makes for good drama
Homey D Clown::Sacramento is at Minnesota tonight. On paper, anyway, this is the night the Lakers fall into last place, tying Sacramento.From there, who knows how deep the cellar is?
Ngoo Nam::These two teams could be dueling in the first or second round playoffs, folks. Or they could be in West Finals, depending on what San Antonion decides to do. tank the playoffs or get into the NBA Finals.  Should be the marquee game of the night, folks.
Tom Ford::Dallas is the worst defensive team in the league.  Carlisle is way overrated as a defensive coach giving up 70+ points in a half and rarely holding teams under 100.  They have no prayer against any reasonable decent offensive team in a playoff series if they are fortunate enough to even make the playoffs.
clint::Griffin and D. Lee play bully ball along with a few others, I wish the league would make some kind of rule limiting the use of bullying, three seconds or only one bump, something to bring back basketball "skill" to the game.
Oink Oink Dooley::I checked my family roots its a straight line like we are dead, scary.
Ignacio::Haha. I hate the Clippers but I jut had to laugh at the colossal collapse of the Dallas Mavericks in the last 1:42 of the game. Up by 12 pts and they had to somehow find a way to lose by missing their last four shots and allowing the Clips to outscore them 14-0 in the last 1:42. Did anybody say 'Defense'? I'm still laughing at both these teams. One and done.
Oink Oink Dooley::I found the UGLY convention, I thought I never would be here it is.
rich m::clips win, lakers lose. All is right in the world.
Kenny Powers::JJ Redick tore it up tonight. The Clips are happy to have him back on the floor. Tough loss for the Mavs!
