Justin::Carter-Williams is gay.  Yet he knows the point guard position and with him, Sixers have distribution; without him, Sixers suck, NONE being able to create their own shot.  Turner is proof positive; he clearly benefits from Carter-Williams being on the floor, garbage when Carter-Williams is not on the floor.  Good win, Sixers, although Joe Johnson did NOT play!  lol
Jack M::Lopez is 7 feet, plays in the post, and shoots under 50%-how can that be? The Nets have almost as many DNP (7) as those that actually played (8). Add a dysfunctional coaching staff and I am surprised they win at all...they were the pre-season favorite in the East...right now they are as pitiful as the Knicks.
donald::That's the Evan Turner who was dominating the league for the first month of the season.  When MCW goes out, Turner has to do all of the ballhandling, most of the scoring and a lot of rebounding.
larry1dart::Trying to figure out how a team gets beaten by 30 points one day and the next wins. I guess consistency and desire are not in the 76er's lexicon.
Peter::There's the 76ers team we all know. Brett Brown is like the PE teacher that just rolls out basketballs every day and sits and daydreams.
- LJ::only 15points and 10assist YUCK!!! top overall pick and future mvp anthony the beast bennet will do much better if he played atleast 35minutes...
Anthony::76ers are now 7-9 with MCW and 1-10 without him. He's had a nice impact thus far in the season.
Slownfastm1::Anyone know why Johnson is not playing?
Larry::Evan Turner is now the beast I though he would be in the NBA when I saw him at Ohio State. 76ers lost a few key players though and hard for Turner to win with this cast. Boy could a team like the Lakers(others too) use this guy.
Patrick::give the ball to evan turner for now. this guy is a beast. philly is nuts to let this guy walk. can you say most improved player this year?
