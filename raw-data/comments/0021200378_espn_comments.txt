goumich1120::Southeast Division Roundup: http://pickandpopdiaries.blogspot.com/2012/12/southeast-division-round-up.html
WeeZynX::so when lebron miss a clutch shot they say he choke,when he have aa monster game they said it was refs help n when he won the ring they say it was wade n because d rose was injured thats funny how haters think lmaooo!!!
hugefan1234::lebron is the best player today and he EARNED his ring. All those haters who say it was a shortened season are just bitter. Now to the leslurpers : Enjoy lebron's game as he one of the best to play it but stop insulting other all time greats like kobe,duncan,wilt and MJ.
Jax Hoff::OK Dad
dwight getting advice from melo on how to get dantoni fired::kobe sux
KingKobe5rings::hey Heat " fans " get LeBrick's di.ck out ur mouths ! HAHA
WeeZynX::hey kobe fan put kobe di.ck in ur mouth n pray while it is in ur muth to see if they can atleast win 5 more games hahaha
method305::Hey Lakers fans stopped getting raped in the rear by Kobrick. Ha Ha H.., oh you like that, well then carry on.
WaterPistolPeteJr::Who paid for Manziels tickets ? I wants answers ESPN
Future Primitive::LeBron is averaging 25.2 points, 8.5 rebounds, 6.8 assists on 54.2% shooting.  If he maintains these numbers he would become the first player in history to average them in a season.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::He beasting.  Others have had season stat lines better in some ways. Oscar Robertson averaged a triple double for a season (less pts though).
Future Primitive::Yeah, Oscar only shot 47% that year though.
KingKobe5rings::I feel confident in riding Wade's di.ck when i get into trouble "  - LeBrick James
koke357799::Hey Kobe tell me how my a.ss tastes  -Shaq
koke357799::Heat domination
SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN 705::SOUTH WILL RISE
Future Primitive::That's now 5 games that LeBron has sat out the 4th quarter because of a blowout.  He's averaged 23 ppg in those games.  If he would've been able to play his standard 38 minutes with that scoring rate in those games his scoring average would be about 27 ppg.  Kobe has played in every 4th quarter this year, even in blowouts.  Durant has only sat out the 4th due to a blowout 3 times.  Just sayin'...
Seskatchewan::blowouts: the only attribute to determine all-time leaders
EricB006::Yes. LBJ took 13 shots and made 9.
EricB006::Nobody since Wilt Chamberlain can dominate a game in all aspects as easily as LBJ.
nba is the worst::Amazing what ref help can do
WeeZynX::hahaha haters gon hate refs help what else ? why u mad bro?
method305::Worst, I'm gonna bet you a bottle of No More Tears for Christmas.
I survived the apocalypse::LeBron hasn't fouled in 211 minutes (5 straight games) now that's a defensive juggernaut pretty Boss
Seskatchewan::he's fouled, but hasn't been called
Oscar Robertson::I voted for O. Asik, Kevin Durant, Tim Duncan, Jeremy Lin, and Tony Allen to be the starters for the west in the All-Stars game.  I voted for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Jeff Green, Rajon Rondo, and John Wall to be the starters for the east in the All-Stars game.
method305::Well those are some craptacular rosters, aka more of a snooze fest than the all-star game already is.
Nibiru Rises::The dominance by the Heat continues. Championship #2 ready to be served!
nba is the worst::Lol - why is this funny?  (Hint - will the heat ever get a title WITHOUT an asterisk)?
method305::They already have. Asterisk are for a$$holes and bitter people. Ho Ho Ho.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::One more thing... Heat suck... LOL  j/\k bye
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Alright... i'm out of here people.  Alycia (you are already gone), CB, Duro, Worst, Run, and everyone else.. Have a wonderful weekend and wonderfuly Christmas!!!!!!! Mery Christmas to you all.

Djuki 3::what kind of phones do you guys have?  anyone have an htc one x+ by any chance?
RunTheBall22._::you should see my land line, i get both out goin and incoming calls
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::@ Duro... you said you were an accountant right.. Remind me not to hire you.. I want my accountant to play full attention and details to all my financial numbers and is obvious that spending time on ESPN says that you do not. lol
Djuki 3::i'm super duper good with numbers, maff is my specialty
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I learned it from WORST.  LOL
Djuki 3::lol it's alright, you made a valid point
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::LOL.... I'm just messing bro........
RunTheBall22._::all of you deserve to be fired for bein on here.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::and you re not gonna include yourself?
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I guess now Duro is gonna head out...LOL
nba is the worst::So what's your "real" user name?
nba is the worst::Seems a bit cowardly, but do I know you in your other guise?
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Now I can tell you out of the 30 teams who I don't like... there's only one team I don't like and that's the HEAT*
Djuki 3::he likes the Heats
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::It's not a problem... just that it's fun when people attack me for being a "knicks" fan.  And sometimes its better for people not to know who you like.... they can't attack you if they don't know.
nba is the worst::And that a problem because?
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Worst.. if I tell you that then I'll reveal my team.....
Djuki 3::where am i going? i'm here til 5
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::They should at least let you leave early this Friday.
Aicyla22::oh $@%! i just got an email i can leave in 5 see ya guys later!!
nba is the worst::see you next week ;)
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::later.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::huh?
RunTheBall22._::hope you enjoyed today's lesson
MiamiFan2004::Enjoy your freedom.
Djuki 3::adios
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Los Lakers!!  LOL
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I haven't emailed that guy yet.....  I still have my "Real" account with my "real" team working so that's all I really care about.
nba is the worst::So did your other acct come back?
Djuki 3::This was a fail!
nba is the worst::If you look closely, there's tiny diamond-encrusted asterisks on those rings
Djuki 3::hahaha you rascal!
Aicyla22::eh
Djuki 3::well you replied to Alycia, not me
RunTheBall22._::who else?
Djuki 3::i hope you were referring to me
RunTheBall22._::you need to get out more but if i looked like that i would try to stay indoors as much as possible . BOOM!!!
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::@ Alycia..  Why do you think I like the Lakers?
Aicyla22::i think you like the lakers or the celtics
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::LOL..........
Jubin3567::LeBron James is is the most dominant player in the NBA bar none. You simply can't put him and Kobe in the same sentence because of the talent disparity.
RunTheBall22._::more because of the rings. call me when lebron gets to three and maybe we can start the discussion
k_angel_iii::I'm sure a 30-something Lebron in his twilight years will not fit into the same sentence as the next major star several years from now. What matters more than the "now" is history. Kobe has the championships and the rings. Let's see if the future will put Lebron in the same category as Lebron when they're both done showing what they brought in entirety.
nba is the worst::Did I just post the bricks per game list here?  What happened?
MiamiFan2004::It didn't bash the Heat, do they figured your account was hacked.
nba is the worst::Ha ha, 2 great replies, and one clunker from alycia
MiamiFan2004::Djuki 3 - we're not defensive, take that back!  Kind of like the Heat, we are less defensive this year....
Aicyla22::"facts" aka manipulated statistics
Djuki 3::we're not defensive, take that back!
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::LOL... good one.
nba is the worst::Facts never bash, despite the defensiveness of heat fans ;)
Aicyla22::yes! it vanished i noticed that too
Aicyla22::must be it was weird there wasnt anything inappropriate
nba is the worst::OKC fan moderator?  LOL
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I thought of a GREAT poem.. but too much for the audience..
Aicyla22::whats that supposed to mean?
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Well... I never used any profanity and lost my other accounts.. I don't want to continue this everyday.
Aicyla22::you like your new username i see
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::its rated , R, X, XX,XXX, XXXXX and I'm not gonna get myself in trouble.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Los Knicks!!!   What the heck is a Knick anyway?
MiamiFan2004::Knickers was an older term for girls panties.  Since the Knickers always had their panties in a bunch about one thing or another, the term just stuck.
Aicyla22::one of urban dictionary's definitions
Aicyla22::An immature move requiring someone to fart into a plastic bottle, cap it, and open and squeeze the plastic bottle to blow fart contents into another's face.  Did you see the look on that guys face after he got Knickerbockered?
Djuki 3::i actually like your def better :)
RunTheBall22._::whats your team you phony
RunTheBall22._::hey that lakers alright, not bad thats a team i can respect
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Cant tell............... :) but its name ends with an "s"
Aicyla22::lakers
Djuki 3::Knickerbocker
Djuki 3::The term "Knickerbockers" traces its origin back to the Dutch settlers who came to the New World -- and especially to what is now New York -- in the 1600s
Djuki 3::wow thank god you guys are back, i was bored to death
Djuki 3::who do you think?
Djuki 3::yes i was including you as well Run ;)
RunTheBall22._::of course he is glad im back, how is this poor kid goin to learn about ball if im not here to correct all the heat fans blind lies
Aicyla22::duro is correct although it is impressive to see how many different ways one person can spell my name
Djuki 3::just look at her name backwards, that's how it's spelled
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::You know who I meant......
Djuki 3::and i meant all of you
Djuki 3::dude it's ALycia*
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Let me take a wild guess... Alicya?
Aicyla22::you're welcome
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::and who are you referring to?
nba is the worst::Bricks per game top 10 list updated:  1. Westbrick 10.88 2. Kobe 10.84 3. Monta 10.71 4.'Melo 10.57 5. Jennings 10.16 6. Gay 9.87 7. Felton 9.76 8.Harden 9.67 9. Aldridge 9.63 10. Waiters 9.53

Knicks Fan Since the other Week::WORST... Don't go to the Dark Side.... you must attack the heat.... it's in your blood brother.
Aicyla22::simmer down

MiamiFan2004::Nah, he is just a troll that jumps from team to team based on who he can use to be anti-Miami.
MiamiFan2004::RunTheBall22._ - im not bandwagon like heat fans slick, i just happen to pay attention to more then just one team and player unlike heatfan 2004 MR bandwagon himself  So wait, I am a bandwagon fan for over 8 years, yet your three day old account with no favorite teams on it is proof of your steadfast loyalty?  To what, trolling?
Aicyla22::bangwagon heat hater
RunTheBall22._::im not bandwagon like heat fans slick, i just happen to pay attention to more then just one team and player unlike heatfan 2004 MR bandwagon himself
Aicyla22::the miami hate is hard for me to understand they went from a team no one cared about to the most hated team in a split second
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I thought you were a Bulls fan?
RunTheBall22._::cause I need Melo to win MVP and take out the heat this year, im looking at them to get the job done

SeminoleCounty::I assume you've added in Howard's FTAs in your score. Only way that makes sense.
rube_26::never a wrong board to throw out facts
Djuki 3::wrong board
The Injured Mamba::It was practice for the Heat last night.  No Dirk, no win for the Mavs.
HEAT_PLANE_NATION17.4::WHOS GUNNA BEAT DA HEAT???????????? DA THUNDA??????????? PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DA SPERMS?????????????? PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DA HEAT WOULD SWALLOW DA SPERMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MiamiFan2004::Knick fans are the usual Jet fans that have alot of spare time since their Jets won't be choking in the playoffs this year.

RunTheBall22._::hey what did Steve Kerr do, someone said he was a dick last night?
