Al Asifyouknow::LOLLLLLOKKLLLKKIOKKKKKKKKK,,,lol
Joe Brooks::Vince Carter. 0 points, 6 turnovers, still in the game. I thought the Mavs had a coach with a brain. WRONG, they have an owner that is in love with over-the-hill players. No playoffs for the Mavs this year.
Alberto Ocasio::What a wasted effort from Calderon. Mavs deserved to lose after missing 3 consecutive shots the previous possession
Chad Wiggins::id much rather have calderon shooting the game winner tonight instead of slow footed dirk

Rolando Mercado::what is up with the mavericks never getting any calls and being sent to the line? ellis drives to the basket almost every time he gets the ball, dirk is dirk and should shoot around4-6 a game. seems like every time i look at the box score dallas shoots half the free throws as the opposition.
Chad Wiggins::are you f********* kidding u flipping moron…. u have calderon who is literally on fire and u give it to that stupid dummy ellis…. he wasn't even aware that they had a foul to give…. dirk was sitting there wide ffffffn open and he just looked him off…..  carlisle is a flipping idiot….
Steve Carman::one min you want dirk to shoot the next min you don't... dude how much you lose on this game! stop gambling you retard. You always come on boards to whinge about losing teams.. you must lose alot you dumbarse
Lester Ayers::bad lost stuff happens I think the mavs can bounce back.......beat phoenix tomorrow and this one don't taste so bad......this was like the Atlanta game
Chad Wiggins::way to play wright…gotta be a tar heel…. looking like the alien from mac and me… or a well kept popeye jones… make a freekin ft…. dirk shoot that ish
Brandon Tigues::monta and dirk play well off each other..monta's been very efficient so far this season, he's shooting around 47 percent
Brett Goldman::Mavs don't deserve to win this game with their poor effort in the 2nd Q and terrible coaching, hope the Raptors pull it out
Al Asifyouknow::Vasquez fan but he better start hitting those shots or next year he be playing in Europe's third division...lol
Yak Djukanovic::WOW. AND THIS IS WHY THE MAV WO'T MAKE THE PLAYOFFS. AFTER LEADING A GARBAGE TEAM BY 20 THEY LOSE THE GAME AT HOME...
Pablo Juarez::They're the 6th seed in the west right now, they're making the playoffs. lol
Duddly Jones::dalllas................needed a break after the first quarter
