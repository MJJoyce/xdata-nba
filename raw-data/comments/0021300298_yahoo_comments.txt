David::I knew Dallas would come out firing in the 2nd half in order to try to negate the home court advantage most see in the 2nd half. It's time for Portland to mount a comeback now. Dallas has to be tired.
Special K::Should be an interesting exercise in shadow boxing.
Anton::Glad the Mavs exposed the FrailBlazers. They only win blowouts but in a close game, when you have Dik Nowitzki and Monta Ellis against Lillypad and Math-eww, you gonna win.
Doug::Gotta give props to Dallas. They played hard, hit shots when they needed to and didn't panic. I guess this game was their revenge for last year....
HughJohnson::Keep it Red hot and Rolling Blazers, RIP CITY!!!1
Donnie H::Lamarcus Aldridge is still probably the most underrated superstar in the NBA.
Commenter::this game is way better than the other game on the jazz and the kings
sergioi::i'm like the only mavs fan in the comments
Dennis::Dirk still has it despite his age. Gotta respect that guy.
Paul::No problem with the loss.  If the other team shoots 53% FG and 50% 3's, and still needs a buzzer beater to win, then that tells you that Portland is a pretty good team.  They fight to the end and never give up and that's what you want from your team.  You can't win them all.  We still need greater bench production, but overall, just keep playing hard.
