Jamie 1144::68 pts! What the hell. Sounds like a high school score.
X3picWarfareX::Were pretty much playing all are games with are  bench players
nonaligned::this can't be the team that took down "king" james
philswin08::wasnt john wall supposed to be good or something?
BearJWS::Don't you know Wall hasn't played this year because he's injured? Try reading the story or looking about the box score. Talk about an uneducated statement.
doggbrown1::who cares if he's injured? have YOU seen him play? the wizards would still be below .500 anyway. 1st pick? i don't think so. OVERRRRAAAATTTTEEDDDD
tizi6969::hm pistons have played 5 more games at this?
willie m::DC area fans used to complain about Mr Pollin's lack of control and talent for both his basketball and hockey teams, now they can complain about Mr Leonsis and his staff too. This organization is interested in one thing and that's taking your money. Wizards poor talent is on Ernie the GM of the year ! As for hockey, I feel for the area businesses that thrived on once sellouts at Verizon Center. Oh wait, DC must be getting a kick back somehow.
EKast2012::Anyone know why Jerebko is not getting much floor time this season?
warrendotcom::Who's worse... the Bobcats from last year or the Wizards this year?
tizi6969::Wiz were bad today, but there whole starting line up is injured...  Wall, Beal, Ariza, Booker, Nene and add in the backup PG too
eric-bledsoe-666::bobcats from last  year
2008PreseasonChamps::Drummond is gonna be a beast
DragicDeath22::Lol the wizards
JamesZhou13::Would you guys go to the Pistons game next Friday just for MC Hammer at halftime?
JamesZhou13::Lol yeah nvm it's against the heat
TigerMichLion111::No
TigerMichLion111::And it's 12-22-12.....
kingtai01::Lol at the idiots that believed that doomdays crap yesterday....
gogreengowhitespartyon73::Drummond and Monroe said no to my autograph request :(
trademarktaz::Do people really think Slava is good? Lol maybe in a couple years if he's even on the Pistons still.
t casey::lol Somehow he was hyped as being better than Drummond leading up to the preseason.
ben_jam_in_5::Michael Smith is the worst official in the nba, not the 1st time ive seen his name mentioned in a officiating controversy, however it rly didnt matter tonight, wiz got they tails kicked and rly couldnt compete against the pistons big men
samerzz16::actually the worst official is Joey Crawford.  There is no competition when it comes to him
FaggenP636::Can we just ship this entire Wizards team to the D-League? I mean now. Worst organization in professional sports.
Rob Parker 1st Take::Seriously Washington, why even have a team?
Dramatic12000::Does anyone remember when Jordan Crawford said he would end up with a better career than MJ.  How's that going?
Philip3664::I wonder what he was on when he was saying this.
Dramatic12000::http://www.bulletsforever.com/2011/10/28/2520506/jordan-crawford-michael-jordan-washington-wizards  Here ya go
JimDetroitFan95::Hilarious...................... I think he scored 16 points after his first 20 shots tonight.
Philip3664::What an idiot lol
Dramatic12000::Jordan Crawford did
JimDetroitFan95::That is hilarious if true............. lmfao
Philip3664::Who the hell said that??
TigerMichLion111::Andre Drummond with 11 pts 14 rebounds and 5 blocks....he's a beast!!  And how many minutes did he do this in?
kevinkeira2::Time to start Drummond coach.  Isn't 14 boards in 21 minutes a clue that it is time to take the training wheels off.  Sure all he can do is dunk on the offense but he is a beast.  He is going to change the offenses shots when on defense because he is such a presense in the lane and he is going to get 12-15 boards a game.  Way better than Jason M. could be expected to deliver.  What do you have to lose coach, you are going to have a sub-par year no matter what with absolutely no chance of a championsip.  Put Jason on the bench, he is a B player and put your real talent on the floor.
BEastChamps2013::21 minutes... only one minute more than starter Maxiell who ended with 4 points and 2 rebs.
manimarf09::I would say this win is 30% Pistons at home and 70% the Wizards FLAT OUT STINKING.
JrueRandallHoliday::Awesome line by Drummond! When he gets it together, boys going to be a straight BEAST!
hoopster_u::Say it again J......
thelakeshow77::Where is Gilbert Arenas these days?
Xx JayHawksFTW xX::Poor Wizards :(
Eric18986::I am surprise anyone would pay Charlie V to play basketball what a bum
BEastChamps2013::Stop being a hater.
Sam_Cassells_Spaceship::Incredible that Joe Dumars hasnt been fired yet.  Why is Tayshaun Prince still on this team?  Why hasnt Charlie V been dumped into the Detroit River?
denn19641::No team would want to trade for them at the moment except for Moose, BK7 and Drummond. will have to wait until the week of trade deadline before any major moves. I'm surprised Frank is still at the helm.
Eric18986::the only players I like for Pistons are Singler, Monroe, and Prince
JrueRandallHoliday::No love for Drummond?
BEastChamps2013::He's a UConn alumnus hater... he doesnt have a clue. Singler blows, as does Prince.
Eric18986::wonder if Pistons can make it to double digits in the win column.
denn19641::Probably 35 to 40.
PrinceofDetroit28::Pistons always get late wins when other teams are trying to tank. They don't know how to tank.
Philip3664::They have a good stretch of home games coming up. Maybe they can take advantage of those. First one comes against the Heat though.
Eric18986::LOL you must have the good weed
PrinceofDetroit28::Nahhh they will get 30 wins.
Eric18986::this team sucks I forgot when Pistons were good
Sam_Cassells_Spaceship::Wait till March.
Jthizz69::this is about as low as the Wizards can go, losing by 32 to a team that entered the day with more losses...
Eric18986::Nice to see Pistons can win one, it's about damn time.
Philip3664::Stuckey got a tooth knocked loose. OUCH
SportsFanatic8564::Who cares?
Sam_Cassells_Spaceship::Washington has 46 total wins in the past three seasons.  OKC had 47 last year during a lockout shortened season.
shut the front door please::Chicago or San Antonio would've been better examples
Sam_Cassells_Spaceship::I felt like the whole 47&gt;46 made it sound better.
scorpioking50::Starting Lineup: C: Drummond PF: Monroe SF: Prince SG: Singler PG: Knight  Reserves: Slava Stuckey JJ Charlie V (lately has shown me he deserves some minutes) Bynum  End of Bench Daye Maxiell English
Sam_Cassells_Spaceship::Charlie V needs to be put in prison for grand larceny.
iVoted4Kodos.::Joe Johnson can be his cell mate.
PrinceofDetroit28::I would rather see English play instead of Bynum.
scorpioking50::I really considered English over Bynum but went with Bynum because of his experience.
JoJo_Reeves612668::Get your draft on: http://tinyurl.com/nba-free-entry5
DetroitFaninDenver::Missed the game, but wow. 100 points with no one scoring more than 15? Thats pretty nice.
hoopster_u::You missed an old fashion $@% kickin'.  They looked like the 2004 Pistons.
scorpioking50::It's Washington. Wonder who would win between these Wizards and last years Bobcats. Game of the year worthy.
PrinceofDetroit28::Drummond played great again.
iVoted4Kodos.::Lots of bench production. Wish that Middleton was activated and played instead of Bynum though.
scorpioking50::Right? Not only that, he should be starting at C in the All-Star game. MVP MVP MVP
iVoted4Kodos.::Yes, Scorpio. Slava should obviously be starting instead of Drummond in the future.
scorpioking50::SLAVA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ksesch313::monroe might be the most underrated player in the nba
etony3314::No, Tayshaun Prince is. People realize how good Monroe is.
QuietStormX::The Wizards are a JOKE! I don't even bother to watch my local NBA team in years now. It seems like the team is just going through the motions or don't really care? Every other pro team in D.C. had shown progress and the fan base with the Nationals with the best record of 98 games last season and Redskins leading the it's division and the Capitols locked out but doing well in recent prior seasons. It's no reason why the Wizards haven't been doing well in seasons now. Just a Joke!
Trey Burketize Me Captin::Haha. Keep drinking the kool aid
etony3314::Give them time. They need a new GM, for one thing.
Trey Burketize Me Captin::You at least have the Redskins. We have to deal with the Lions in the D
scorpioking50::I ask this question not as if I am taking a shot at you Wizard fans: do you guys wish you took Drummond in the draft now?
hoopster_u::Say it again Kennedy.  Drummond looks what?  :-)
mrkennedy23::Beal has kind of stepped up his game lately, but Drummond does look great.
ksesch313::Drummond might not have the offensive game that anthony davis has, but he will be the better player in a few years and the steal of the draft
Philip3664::Haven't heard his name a whole lot this year. I know he had that stretch where he was out with a injury, but still.
Philip3664::I agree. Its a shame he doesnt get enough minutes to be in the ROY conversation
ksesch313::If drummond was playing starter minutes he would probably be in 2nd for ROY so far behind lilard
Philip3664::Knowing how BAD the Pistons are on the road, they will go into Washington tomorrow and get blown out just like they did to the Wizards
Philip3664::You know what, i take that back. What i saw from the Wizards tonight makes me think it will be a close game but the Pistons will lose it just because how BAD they are on the road.
chris99171::If any team needs Scalabrine to come out of retirement, this is it.
