Michael Repko::whaat a CHOOOOOOKE job!! bears and bulls know how to do it best...........embarrassments to the city of Chicago! how the hell do you let someone get a clear lane to the bucket and create a 3 point play???? unbelievable!
Paul Walker::Chicago sports is aweful...basketball team sucks and it's boring to watch...both baseball teams blow..and the football team is getting old and full of drama...at least hockey is good, eh?
Raj Patel::too bad hockey doesnt entertain me as much as those sports you've listed
David Han::Actually, the Bulls might be playoff bound this season
Robert Rtype Taylor::It beats what's going on in ny!!!!
Will McCoy::"Guys we gotta tie this game up.  Deng and Noah are going for 60 mins played tonight!"  -Thibs

JJ Kulju::tony snell could be the answere to all our prolbems this year lms if you think so
Scott Carter::A Bulls fan with a Tiger avi? You should be arrested!!
Erica N Kenneth Martinez::Why did he only play 22 minutes. I didn't see the game and haven't heard anything
Will McCoy::Lottery here WE COME!
Will McCoy::I just want me anti tanking bulls fans to stop acting like this core group of bulls players just cant be broken up when their proudest moment in 3 years is getting to the ECF and losing in 5 games.  Stop acting like this team is the old Spurs and you just gotta keep them together because they ve accomplished so much
Taylor Manes::THATS WHAT THIBS AND GAR TRYING TO DO..YOU HAVE TO GET NEW PLAYERS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIX..LETS SAY YOU HAD A FIRE IF YOU ADD FUEL   TO THE FIRE IT LASTS LONGER BUT IF YOU LET IT SIT IN THE COLD IT DIES OUT...We need new players to add fuel to the fire, and we dont need to just have this group together because it will not get us anywhere...Im still trying to find out, How were going to get deep in the playoffs..Im tired of getting shutdown by miami..
Taylor Manes::"Man WE got the heat next"  -Chicago Bulls  "Naww YALL got the heat next, IM injured" -Derrick Rose..LOl I felt like making this..btw its not originally mine.
Al Sotowitz::You miss me now don't you b*tches!  -Nate Robinson-
Matt Cauthen::Us Bulls fans are in purgatory.
Paul Walker::I do t know what that means but it sounds about right
Taylor Manes::If you give up on the bulls just because their not doing their best right now, Youre a bandwagoner...Some of yall worst than heat fans..i mean heat bandwagoners.
Jason Peters::college basketball>NBA  and its not even close
Will McCoy::There is a difference between me giving up on the organization and not believing this currently assembled team is the epitome of mediocre
Paul Walker::Taylor, you're the same person talking about wanting to tank games. Shut up.
Joshua Hsu::man bulls fans are really down. just scroll through these comments. losing rose again destroyed the hope in this city. i feel for ya.
Chad Wiggins::Alex Doub lol
Joshua Hsu::haha i'll one up you alex doub. i'm a 76ers fan living in illinois. so if you want to talk about teams stuck in the middle with major injury pain (see Andrew Bynum), then let's be friends.
Taylor Manes::Alex Doub  True...
Tyjuan McCants::Bulls-97 Pelicans-89
Casiano Servaz Tubana III::Lol
Eugene Wilson::no   anthony  davis  for  pelicans   fractured  his  arm   gooooo   bulllls
Joe Re::what happened to BOOZER??
Taylor Manes::Ikr..WHAT HAPPENED?
Tar Yak::Bulls Win.  83-76
Casiano Servaz Tubana III::Lol
Taylor Manes::wow...DOES ANY BULLS FAN BESIDES ME WANT THE BULLS TO TANK? Trade Boozer now while hes looking good,get another center to help noah,WTF IS NAZR GOING TO DO? Trade Deng..(Some teams REALLLY WANT HIM) D-LEAGUE TEAGUE (LMFAO) Trade Hinrich (get another   backup pg) TRY TO GET NATE ROBINSON BACK(trade players  iif necessary) TRY TO GET MARCO BACK (trade  players if necessary)  USE THAT CHARLOTTE PICK.... and tank this season like hell to get parker...BUT WIGGINS LOOKING GOOD THO!! GET RID OF MIKE JAMES!!! GET RID OF MURPHY!! AND TADA YOU HAVE ROOM TO REGROW..  If they find a way to get parker or wiggins, which they wont, Chicago would be very happy... I can see it right now..ROSE and parker standing side by side  on a poster with a bulls jersey on and parker with the basketball,and the poster says THE CHOSEN ONES FROM CHICAGO!  IF that happens, GOD IS A BULLS FAN!! See More
Al Sotowitz::Rose would be wearing a suit in that poster.
Tony Ellis::A) Boozer might have some value, but Chicago would have to take back salary in the form of expirings, and any team that would trade for Boozer at this point in the season wouldn't be able to give a high pick in return.  B ) Deng has some value. He has an expiring contract and can help a contender. But, once again, the Bulls would have to find a suitable trade partner and would have to take back salary in return, and also, they wouldn't get a high pick, since anyone who would make a move for Deng would not be a lottery type team. The Bulls would get, at most, sixty cents on the dollar.  C) Sending Teague to the D-League is fine, except that the Bulls would have no suitable backup PG. They could always sign one off the street.  D) You won't get much for Hinrich.  E) Denver can't even trade Robinson until December 15. And why would... they trade him? He has a team-friendly contract and has been a catalyst off their bench. He's exactly what the Bulls DON'T need right now, as he wouldn't be in Chicago's long-term plans, and if tanking was what they wanted to do, this year would be a wash anyway.  F) San Antonio can't trade Belinelli until December 15. Once again, why would they trade him? Who does Chicago have that they would want? They would love Jimmy Butler, but it would make no sense for Chicago to trade him. For them to trade for Deng (who would fit in great with San Antonio), Chicago would have to take back matching salary. The only other player besides Parker and Duncan to, along with Belinelli, have enough matching salary is Tiago Splitter, who has a $10M annual salary and three years remaining after this one. This is the only thing that even comes close to making sense for both teams (Deng for Splitter, Belinelli, and a future 1st round pick)  G) Get rid of Mike James and Murphy...just waive them? Why bother? Are they too good for the Bulls' tanking strategy or something?See More
Paul Walker::Bulls will still be 4th seed at worst...you're a LOSER if you want your team to lose
Paul Steeno::This loss really hurt for me as a fan. It was ironic as heck that we lost on a defensive meltdown when Coach Thibs was playing his best defenders the entire overtime. If I was Coach Thibs, I would have switched defense-offense between Gibson and boozer. Boozer provides another scoring option that the defense has to worry about. The Bulls showed fight and resilience tonight though. I'm so proud to root for a team as tough as the Chicago Bulls. We will get the Heat on Thursday.
Taylor Manes::Thats right be a tough fighter..DONT QUIT..I still think we need jesus though..
Paul Steeno::what we need is to figure out why we are getting all this bad luck. GO BULLS. FOREVER
Taylor Manes::Paul Steeno  WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO US?  ALL THE TEAMS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE LOSING ARE WINNING AND ALL THE TEAMS THATS SUPPOSED TO BE WINNING ARE LOSING... MAN LOSING ROSE AGAIN WAS THE WORST THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN TO US...THATS PROBABLY WHY THE BULLS CONFIDENCE IS DOWN..AND LACK OF EFFORT...THEY TRIED TONIGHT THEY REALLY DID BUT I KNOW WHAT THE BULLS ARE CAPABLE OF THEY CAN BE BETTER THAN THAT...Losing rose really did bring their self esteem down,..
Tyler DuPont::this will show you all http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZgqVEmPCWg&feature=youtu.be
Bheng Zhuum::What idiot names a sports team the Pelicans  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Andrew Fuehring::It's so depressing, the Bulls are screwed, Thibs will make sure they win enough to get into the playoffs... get hammered 1st round... and end up with a late first round draft pick to draft some career bench player... FML
Chad Wiggins::lol i use the fml  way too much... my wife slugs me everytime i say it now and calls me an ungrateful jerk... she says what does that say about me and cash ( my little boy ) and i reply with the obvious, im not counting u 2, ya'll are the best things that have ever happened to me..  sports means way too much to some of us... bless our hearts... my condolences about d rose.... hated that ish happened to him again... hopefully he comes back next year and stays completely healthy
Taylor Manes::Nice choking another game Chicago..You surely do know how to disappoint us...As for the haters You sure do know how to hurt a person even worse when hes already down..THANKS ALOT...
Chad Wiggins::behindlick hynrich is the biggest brick laying bum ive ever seen get big min... the bulls need to go get fredette and let him run around and jack it like he did at byu.... the need help offensively
Taylor Manes::IF WE END UP LOSING THERES ALWAYS ANOTHER CHANCE...NEXT GAME!! YEP...AND THE GAME AFTER THAT..AND THE GAME AFTER THAT...Hopefully we win this game..
Jason Peters::Bulls got it now, that was the Pelicans only chance and they blew it.
Paul Steeno::This game just adds insult to injury after all the crap we have been through the last week and half. The Bulls will rise again. Never give up. Bulls all day, every day.
