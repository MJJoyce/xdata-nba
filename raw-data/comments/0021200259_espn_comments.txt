Kobe6rings2013::notice KG hasn't been pounding his chest ever since he got punked...he hasn't been the same since..LOL
themightyrule10::Klove's love affair with the 3 point line will the wolves downfall
luvnbayes::I sort of agree with you on Randolph, though I get the feeling he's not exactly a bright bulb.  But I always liked he way he played too.  As far as Love goes, I've said since the start of last year that it is obvious that Rubio is the Wolves MVP, not Love.  Love now plays like he's entitled, instead of out working everybody like he used to.
Kev_010::kevin love makes some of the most stupid decisions with the ball no wonder wolves lost.
luvnbayes::Somebody has to be the WORST player in the league, correct?  I nominate Greg Stiesma.  He can jump.  That's the list of his positives.  But he has bad instincts, terrible hands, and no skills.  Name someone worse in the league.  I thought the surest way to sport riches was to be a left handed relief pitcher.  But no, it's being 6' 10" and being able to jump.
Syrindge::I don't know man, Ryan Hollins is pretty damn bad...
themightyrule10::should have kept anthony randolph, he can run and plays well with rubio
Bandwagons should not post in this site::Rondo went to Mexico for his 2 day suspension, seems like it was more of a vacation then a punishment.
catimmerman::i'm 12 and what is this
Paul Pierce is the TRUTH::I can confirm, I am Mexico
_I Am A Celtic_::Don't believe everything you read/hear
_I Am A Celtic_::C's!!
ThatsGoodSoup7963::14/30 from the FT line? Yikes...anyway, go CELTICS. Good to see Rajon back, he's a true baller.
4thQuar7er::Rondo lost his 10 assist streak right the other day?
Excelscior1::YES
ChrisSinatra::Rondo= best pg in the game baby
SFthomas1969::Ive been using a bet system called sportsbettingstar. Ive made around 3k a month each month I have followed this system. If you search google for sports betting system you will find out how this system works..
SFthomas1969::Ive been using a betting system called sportsbettingstar the past few months now. I doubled my starting balance my first month and made almost $3,000 my 2nd month using this system. If you search google for Sports betting systems you can find more about this system there. If you bet on sports this system will make you money.
puntang sally::2 games for a push (defending a teammate) was stupid to begin with.  in the 1980s, you had to punch and connect with a guy's face (hard) before you faced a suspension.  p u s s y -league now

Minnysota Vikings::Nice win tonight ChargersFan. I think Cousins has the potential to be a top 3 center in the league.
ChargersFan4Life001::ty, but im not sold on moving evans. he has been great recently and if he keeps it up we should keep him
Minnysota Vikings::Which one would you say is the best distributor?
ChargersFan4Life001::great last year, struggled this year. we have 3 pgs but not sold on any of them as the long term pg of the team. I like him but he needs to be better
