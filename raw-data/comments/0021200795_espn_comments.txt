ATL Bravos_do it for bobby::GS thinks a soft schedule will help them down the stretch? you guys are another curry broken ankle away from being the bottom dweller trash your team always has been. only this year it's prolly too late to maintain your protected pick...no matter how badly you guys try and tank.
LilDwayne21::What's going to happen in the Western Conference when the Warriors have to try and hang with veteran basketball teams like the Clippers and the Spurs? In spite of all the improvement this team has made, they just might be too young at this stage in their career to make a run in the Playoffs and have to grind out wins against veteran teams like the Clippers and the Spurs. #EXPERIENCEMATTERS
LilDwayne21::The Utah Jazz is a veteran basketball team. Yes, the Golden State Warriors have made tremendous strides to improve their game, but they're a young who lacks the experience of the Jazz.
bullsonparade1986::As a Rockets fan, I find this hilarious
sfurse77::I Love how Karma works, GSW are going to keep losing and Jazz will get there lottery pick this year. What's funny is there tanking again this year but it's not on purpose.
tbest23::Remember a few weeks ago when ESPN went off about the Warriors as a contender and some fans pounding their chests? I do. Bwahahahahaha
BRAY5150::it took longer than expected but the Warriors are finally the team everybody thought they were. Fighting for a playoff spot is in their future
sfurse77::To all of you GSW fans Talking trash yesterday! I just wanna say one thing! Suckit Tribeck!
gswarrior831::warriors are in a good spot at #6...the clippers are probably the best match up for them...
NYeltigre::They WILL not stay put at 6. They will drop to 8
popeseanpatrick::ESPN: Your writers are terrible. This article was nothing but grammar mistakes and mixing up a players name (hard to do when there is only 13 guys on a roster). You guys should really re-evaluate how you run things over there because these petty mistakes you guys make over an over again were corrected for most people while attending elementary school. The sad part of this story is realizing you know more than this idiot but you'll still be glanced over while he continues to put out this mediocre reading material. I look forward to the day a different network is able to run unbiased sports highlights so I don't have to listen to your people talk about the same thing for thirty minutes just to see my team get a 30 sec highlight on ESPN while other games get talked about for 5-10 minutes. Good riddance!
NashvilleBulldog28::Glad Gordon is back!  One tough guy taking that early hit to the shoulder and powering on.
Whittinghamscalves::Tankers
walle D_ D::I think my Rockets got in their heads, ever since they had to foul fus to prevent us from breaking a record, the team just doesn't seem nearly as good. I don't see how getting eric gordon would help them either. Just another injury proned player on their team.
bullsonparade1986::yep
Dawan208::.
Grindhouse2413::Bwahahahaha do you even want to be in the playoffs Cowards? How many losses is this in a row?
Bala88::It's a bad stretch, these guys have the personnel to turn this around
TheWalkingDead92::Warriors have just been overachieving. Now they are back to earth...
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Both these teams are cool!
nba is the worst::Bogut with the 0-pt game.  Harder to integrate him than it should be, apparently.  And PHX took it to Portland on the road last night - is that good or bad for the warriors?
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Damn ESPN, get it together
CrabtreeWasHeld::@houston, @OKC Back2back, @memphis, @Dallas b2b, vs Houston, @ houston....every team in the league would lose 6 in a row...so i dont care about it
PlayaMade5::Whatever the case may be, keep on losing
LightsGoDownIntheCity::We have an easy schedule to end the year. Dubs will bounce back my friend
CrabtreeWasHeld::@houston = @ jazz but I dont really care about the loss so ya
LightsGoDownIntheCity::We have a cake schedule to end the season, dubs will come back strong my friend
CrabtreeWasHeld::steph curry is better than everyone so I don't care about the losses
tbest23::But we all know he has glass ankles and plays matador defense...
Ivanov21::what is that supposed to mean? you like Curry but you don't care about his team??
Sinistersedan847::Lol! Golden State is sh*ting the bed! Lol!
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Still 6th seed my friend with a soft schedule coming up
ensign.devyn::I dedicate this to all the GS fans that were on this board today.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xdPu3fnGrc
jzalvarado2.0::ensign.devyn What's sad is without tanking, I, and I'm sure most Jazz fans, could see myself supporting GS as much I support any non-division, non-rival, small(ish) market team. No one to hate on their roster, in fact plenty to like. But Mark Jackson, the tanking, the way that organization is run, and the fans that showed on these boards today (this has been the worst gameday we've had with an opposing fan base as a whole, I'm pretty sure) just ruins them for me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The difference between our fans and your garbage fans is that our fans don't troll your f.ucken boards.  Utah is irrelevant.  I could give two s.hits who and when they play.  Your garbage fans on the other hand, trolled every single one of our games during the 2nd half of last season.
Whittinghamscalves::It looks like we will be trolling your board again this year because it looks like your organization is tanking again...still trying to keep that draft pick?
jzalvarado2.0::And that's the reason why we dislike your fans.  Your fans trolled at the fact that we tanked your pic.  AND they trolled hard.  This is not like a SF Giants/LA Dodgers rivalry were both fanbases troll each other in an endless cycle.  This was started directly by all the Jazz fans trolling every single one of our games in the latter half last year.  Before that, I (and most of the regulars on here) couln't even give two s.hits about the Jazz one way or the other.
ensign.devyn::What do you expect? Your organization made a classless, pathetic move and tanked, and that tanking cost Jazz fans a draft pick. Draft picks are very important to a small market team like Utah, and are a valuable commodity in every offseason. Idk why you WOULD care about the organization you're hurting by tanking. You directly affected the Jazz organization, it's team, and it's fans. Your organization is not one the Jazz respect, nor will they ever, as you do things the exact opposite way of how our FO's does things.
ginblossoms1972::Been following this bet system called Sportsbettingstar. I doulbed my initial balance my first month and made almost $3000 my 2nd month just following its bets. You can find the system on the first page of Google by searching for sports betting systems.  I have bet on sports for years and this is one of the better systems I have tried.
limespiderz911::thanks....and go away forever......amway geek!
ginblossoms1972::Thanks mate
ensign.devyn::Impeccable timing.
Hank10593::Free fall for the GS during the last 10 games or so, I guess they are what we call the pretenders.
ensign.devyn::What's sad is without tanking, I, and I'm sure most Jazz fans, could see myself supporting GS as much I support any non-division, non-rival, small(ish) market team. No one to hate on their roster, in fact plenty to like. But Mark Jackson, the tanking, the way that organization is run, and the fans that showed on these boards today (this has been the worst gameday we've had with an opposing fan base as a whole, I'm pretty sure) just ruins them for me.
rbmw263::I like Klay, I like Curry, I Like Lee, Bogut etc....If it werent for Mark Jackson and the GS FO i would root for GS
rbmw263::Barnes definitely.  Draymond Green was one of my "sleepers to watch" coming out of college.  no tools on that roster.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Jarrett Jack was awesome in "Jerry Maguire" and "As Good As It Gets"
ensign.devyn::I'd add Barnes to that list too, good up and coming player. And Jarret Jack.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I just don't like that insufferable "K he spells his name with. I also hate Indian food.
D-Will is a fat coach-killer.::<b>"No one to hate on their roster"  You mean besides David Lee, Curry, and their sh.it-talking, taunting, classless bench?</b>
ensign.devyn::Most benches get into it...
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Hmm. I didn't see Lee do any of that tonight. As far as the bench, nothing wrong with talking some trash. Part of the game.
D-Will is a fat coach-killer.::<b>David Lee talks sh.it to Blake Griffin all the time while getting outplayed by him.  Curry is an annoying fluke jump shooter who celebrates every made basket like he just won Finals MVP.  The bench ridiculed Blake for missing a shot, which is pathetic.</b>
ensign.devyn::Why would you hate Curry and Lee? What does their bench do that's so bad?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I don't have a problem with David Lee.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::BOOTY LOAF!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::BOOTY LOAVES!!!
ensign.devyn::We had about 8 of them tonight.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Interesting, Curry went 2 for 5 in the 1st, 3rd and 4th quarters and 6 for 7 in the 2nd. GS got outscored in the 1st, 3rd and 4th quarters but outscored Utah by 2 in the 2nd. So, if Curry shoots over 80% all game, they have a chance.
D-Will is a fat coach-killer.::<b>"What's contending? I've only heard of tanking."  - junoXJ</b>
junoXJ::What's alcohol? They serve apple cider and orange juice at the game.  -Utah fans
free derrick favors::Alcohol is banned at jazz games. We only get chocolate milk. Not even apple cider is allowed
HayesBischoff::Theres several bars at the Jazz arena. Idiot
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Cider resembles alcohol. Gotta be on the safe side.
rbmw263::Score 1 for stereotypes.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::"Get a free switch blade with the purchase of any ticket to a Golden State home game!"
ensign.devyn::Yeah, we need bulletproof vests just to go the bathroom in oakland.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Only because anyone who talks... gets stabbed.
junoXJ::we aren't even known for stabbings.. fail
Ruckusmh::Millsap for Bledsoe + Odom, getter done KOC.
danielwsmithee::I'm surprised there is not more talk about Jefferson going to the Clippers.  He could play center in the place no offense Jordan, when defense is needed they could swap them out.  Jefferson + fillers for Butler + Odom + Blesoe would work out well.   Jeremy Evans (I would hate to loose him, but he would fit in really well in Lob City).
2noodlekaboodle::I would rather have Millsap than BG, in the last 2 minutes of a game. Sap is clutch, and actually can hit a free throw.
thejunkinmytrunk::As a Clippers fan I really don't want that trade to happen. Like really really don't want that trade to happen. Millsap makes no sense for our team.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::And CP3 is playing 40 mpg in the playoffs. Bledsoe will hardly see the court. If they are in "win now" mode, Millsap will be very helpful to that end. Jazz fans will be sad to see him go.
rbmw263::you will never get everything you can out of Bledsoe bc of Cp3.  Millsap fits perfectly in your style of play and would give you a very strong 3 man big rotation.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Not sure how anyone would think that, but I'll fight to the death your right to have that opinion.
Ruckusmh::I couldn't care less which one.
free derrick favors::Butler instead of Odom
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Jazz have $8 million coming off the books at the end of the season if Millsap isn't traded and he walks. Jazz have $8 million coming off the books, plus have Bledsoe if the trade is made. Financially, getting Bledsoe for next to nothing.
rbmw263::Thats an expensive no show tho..Maybe Greg wasnt ok with paying a guy 8 mil to not even show up
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Odom would never even take a flight to Utah and that's fine by everyone involved.
rbmw263::Odom would be our 8 million dollar Raja Bell.  he would just cry until he signed back in hollywood anyway.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Odom's contract is expiring. Buy him out and send him on his chubby way.
rbmw263::Clips would never go for that.  Butler actually contributes
cardsbluesjazz::If the playoffs began today.  Western Conference:  1:SA 43-12 vs 8:Hou 29-26, 2:OKC 39-14 vs 7:Utah 31-24, 3:LAC 39-17 vs. 6:GS 30-23, 4:Mem 34-18 vs 5:Den 34-21.

legend_jr27::Who doesn't know the standings? I'm sure 90%+ check the standings and know who's matched with who? Except for 7th and 8th seeds in each conference the matchups haven't really changed much.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::You could have just posted a link to the standings.
thejunkinmytrunk::'"Everyone kept saying, `We owed them," guard Paul Foye said of a spirited Monday night practice session. "Tonight we came out and had a different swag about us. . We wanted to show them they're not going to walk over us this time."'  Apparently Utah got a new guard named Paul Foye. He might be related to Randy Foye ESPN, I would go look that up. Come back and tell us ESPN.
thejunkinmytrunk::Good for the Clippers, the Clippers pitching this year has been weak. The Clippers needed to improve there pitching.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Cliff Lee started for the Clippers too.
rbmw263::I keep seeing that we are "only" 4 1/2 games behind memphis, thinking it might be possible to catch them.  Then I realize if they finished the season 16-14 we would have to go 19-8 to catch them.  My memory sucks, im sure ive said this before
ensign.devyn::Hey, Al Jefferson's defense COULD be worse. He could be David Lee.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Man, his D really was p¡ss poor tonight.
ensign.devyn::He knows the definition of clear out. Just on the wrong side of the court
free derrick favors::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0-nRWiVuHU

TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::T'was a good shot.
killeryams1779::Please trade Millsap..I beg you
killeryams1779::I'd take anything over nothing.  Which is what we get if we hold onto him.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::No, Jazz get over $8 million of cap space freed up, which would later be used to ensure Favors and Hayward get resigned at the end of next year. Any trade  needs to be a smart one.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::That's a weird thing to say.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I'm all for a trade if a good one is available, but yours seems overzealous.
killeryams1779::Why's that?
junoXJ::Joe Johnson &gt; anybody on the Jazz

Ruckusmh::Millsap for Bledsoe + Odom. Book it.
adamsbrian88::we probably wont hear about anything till its a done deal
ensign.devyn::Nothin at all. You know as much as we do. However, Dennis Lindsey was on the broadcast tonight and didn't deny nor confirm the rumors, and the Jazz have shot down a lot of others, so it's probably a legit one.
Chin6biz::What trade scenarios do you like?
