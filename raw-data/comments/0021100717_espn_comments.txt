angels5824::why doesnt gooden play more?
New_York_For_The_Win::Bucks suck they won't make the playoffs even with that EASY SCHEDULE they have, and that says all. Bucks just suck big time
Antsea91::Bwahaha a NY fan shouldn't be talking. When was the last time the knicks won a playoff game?

Oaktown1029::Ellis took the least number of shots of all the starters - what's going on?
buckspackers23::Injured, and he wants to fit in right now.
Oaktown1029::I guess he's trying to show he can pass too - his assists were way up this year.
ColtsnIrish038::I just can't figure out the Pacers.
J-Tjuan::What happened to the Bucks Defense from last year?  I thought thats all what Skiles was good at.

Larke30864::Good job, Indy.
gupsphoo::Nice blow-out.

buckspackers23::Okay, WiscoMase23... Can you explain to me why JON-FUCKING-BROCKMAN is active over Leuer? It doesn't make sense.
WiscoMase23::i have no good answer for you
WiscoMase23::i will just say this . . . there is no reason whatsoever to have a solid rookie wasting away on the bench. none
buckspackers23::Even though Skiles has this team winning, i still think he should be fired for stuff like this.
WiscoMase23::i have a hard time believing its an attitude problem with leuer but that is what puts players in skiles doghouse
buckspackers23::Do we not want Leuer to develop?

Rexanilatorz::Brandon Jennings has all his shot attempts
maccasgay::he sucks
adavisrc09::Damn San Antonio barely beat the hornets?
mrkennedy23::As long as they pulled off the win, unlike the Clippers.
mrkennedy23::If you're an above .500 team you should beat the Hornets.
adavisrc09::LOL but the clippers aren't that good
NickMull2::Haha... Nice momentum killer Delfino
buckspackers23::He kicked out his leg......
sabermetrics are right::I don't want to make a huge deal about this because it's not a close game. But there is no 5 second closely guarded violation in the NBA. there is a 5 second back to the basket rule, but no 5 second closely guarded rule as there is in college.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_second_basketball_rule  Say "it's wikipedia" all you want but the citations link directly to the NBA's website.
