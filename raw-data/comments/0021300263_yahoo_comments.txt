WISCO::Kidd will be gone very soon.  I thought maybe he'd do well, but after seeing his immature games and definitely the soda dropping incident, I don't believe now.  I have youth coaches in my high school program who are better than this.
clint::Nets there must be 50 assistant coaches available and you picked someone with zero experience and call him coach? Maybe you should have spent 100 million $ on players to cover up this mistake?
Rasetsu::Nets really suck! since they suck, they've got nothing to do but try to injure key players of other teams.
Anton::Looking back, this was a genius trade by the Celtics...
Rico M::Billy King is more to blame than Kidd.. The Nets need a new president and coach.. I vote for Jerry Sloan to take over both jobs and make Kidd his assistant.
Joe::brooklyn is a joke. hire jason kidd who has no coaching experience, sign old veterans who dont have much left and who are starters. the owner spent all that money and look at their record thus far. he will learn the hard way u can't buy championships.....and also nearly every time nets lose is by blow outs hahaha
tony p::Nets are an exact mirror of the lakers last season. New coach , ton of injuries !
PKM::Should be another tough one for the Nets to win.  I'd like to see Lopez dominate.
Wasp::Wow Garnett had two points. Thats half of his season average!   LOL
Plain Truth::As a knicks fan I am very distraught. What a waste of players for Melo. Mozgov looks like a beast 20 boards.  Knicks and Nets are overrated. Nets complained that Lopez not being in the line-up was the reason of their losing, well he was in tonight and they got blown out. Chandler will come back to the Knicks and it will be the same story - lose. Time to blow up the knicks and then Nets who cares.   Thursday's game between the Nets and Knicks will be bragging rights to what? who's the less crappiest team in NY?
