Justin::Good win, Bobcats (HORNETS)!  If Jordan/Management can hear me, get 3 VETERANS to compliment the HORNETS (Bobcats) then NBA league, watch out!  Good win, Charlotte!
Leigh::Rotation?  They have no rotation...to go with no rebounding, no shooting and no defense.
Conservatino::Bobcats has great deep roster on forwards and centers, but very thin roster on guards. Bobcat's big guys such as Josh McRoberts, Al Jefferson, Bismack Biyombo, Jeff Adrien, Cody Zeller, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, play really well this season. Jeff Adrien is very good on offensive rebounding. Guards, Kemba Walker and Gerald Henderson, played very well. Hope they keep improving.
michaela::As much as I like Zeller, I still think he made a mistake leaving Indiana for the NBA.  He isn't ready for the NBA and he really could've developed a lot more with another year at IU.
jammin400::Milwaukee may be the worst team in the league.  This coach needs to figure out a solid rotation or he needs to go.
PKM::Bobcats vs Bucks, battle of the forest.
Anton::Bobcats are on pace to make the playoffs...
Devil's Advocate::I thought is was bad when they had 35 points out of their starting 5 a few games ago.  18 is atrocious!  I can only laugh (sadly).
acenando::and i want to see erson as a shooting guard not a powerfoward guy cant post up
acenando::gm i s the worst maneger ever u dont bring back old players that never showed any potantial ridnour delfino and zaza and then getting brandon knight and oneal  wow  we have a gm that has no clue on building a team
