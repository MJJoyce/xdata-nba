mosesbyu::Free Jimmer.
Cp3TheSavage::Looking good Clippers keep it up #LATakeover #Cp3
sklater::Ailurophobia, you are quite the comedic.  You say that Jimmer sucks.  Then when someone says Brooks sucks, you call them out that they can't rip Brooks, because it's Smart's fault.  When someone says it's Smart's fault about Jimmer, you just say no, Jimmer sucks.    AND, don't look at my kid, I don't want you to get tempted or anything.
razzledazzletj81::I know it's only 6 AM on a Sunday, but did Smart get fired yet? Either way if they replace him from within Jimmer will still be stuck. Jimmer can only be saved by a trade and the team can only be saved from an outside coach if they want to be saved.
ArtieSullivan::Clips with Chauncey: 2 - 0
SSparkySteelerssaysJetsStink::Not sure who is worse the Maloofs or Smart?
C.H.Soopadoops::maloofs are worse because the kept smart for another season.
johnnyx2011::Maloofs are worse bc they hired Smart.
TyrekeTheKing13::good game clips our offense sucked!!! jimmer didnt do great but thats all right its just 1 game... good to see JT doing alright. GO KINGS!!!!
ChargersFan4Life001::well since this board is pretty much dead, im gonna leave. UK, there are people on the c's board which is where im going if you want to go there you can. GG GL clips, kings suck sadly. gn all go kings
Ailurophobia::jeremy Lin &gt; JImmer
Ailurophobia::I'm going to pick up JImmer right now and make a straight trade for LBJ.
Ailurophobia::LBJ ws mine to begin with.
Ailurophobia::Boogie, did you pick up the Jimmer in fantasy?
jonh876::lets go clippers  we should ge a cwin in utah on monday
dahojas::doubt it. Undefeated at home.
Ailurophobia::Let's all picture a Wade v. Jimmer showdown...  LoL
Ailurophobia::I think everyone here should forget about that flash in the pants Jimmer and honor Tebow, a man who is truly being held down.
ChargersFan4Life001::no
Ailurophobia::Get off the Jones kool aid.
ChargersFan4Life001::brooks has struggled recently and isnt a good passing pg, jimmer is a better passer and maybe a better shooter
Ailurophobia::How are you going to rip Brooks when it is clear that Smart is the problem.
ChargersFan4Life001::i dont think tebow would have made the jets into a playoff team this year, and im not saying jimmer starting would have made the kings elite. but both would probably be better than sanchez and brooks
Ailurophobia::Finally, but I know you are being facetious.
ChargersFan4Life001::fine, tebow should start, but so should jimmer
Ailurophobia::Tebow beat the freaking Steelers last year. The Steelers.
Ailurophobia::AND you want me to agree to liking the Jimmer??????????????
Ailurophobia::Tebow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ailurophobia::How can you hate Tebow and love the Jimmer?
ute-jazz for life::we dont know that....
ute-jazz for life::fredettes never had a chance to run his team... and if taking measely white byu to #4 in the country isnt qualification for making his team win. nothing should qualify
Ailurophobia::Jimmer could never lead an NBA team. get real.
ute-jazz for life::prob has something to do with the whole aztect thing.... lol... the little chubby wonder was lights out man... he deserved some lime light
ChargersFan4Life001::he was great at byu but was getting a LOT of coverage
ChargersFan4Life001::i dont hate jimmer, i was just sick of his coverage all the time(like jimmer at byu).
ChargersFan4Life001::I meant tebow
Ailurophobia::How should I respect that?
Ailurophobia::But you hate tebow and he he made his team win1
ChargersFan4Life001::JIMMER!
ute-jazz for life::dont mind him... he the equivalent  of the devil, trying to keep u from traveling down the straight and narrow.. shun him and speak to him no more.. he starts pedi convos on a sports forum
ute-jazz for life::dont be ashamed.. never tooo late... jimmer will forgive u of any past transgressions
Ailurophobia::die
Ailurophobia::....
ute-jazz for life::feels good huh...
ChargersFan4Life001::he deserves more time, smart is an idiot.
epitome1986::what?! lamar odom showed up today with a nice little stat line.
ute-jazz for life::http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/scoring-per-48-minutes/sort/avg48Points/position/point-guards
Pau Gasol.::That stat is skewed. Jimmer plays minimal minutes so any points scored in that time are inflated through a full game estimation
kingsdynasty12::yep he sucks this year...... sad stat.... especially when u consider that he never played tonight until mop up duty
Jail Blazer::The Kings tonight were just like Sacramento's new arena plan. Not there at all
ChargersFan4Life001::this board died quickly
LobCityCP32BG32::are the kings the new clippers?
ute-jazz for life::worse
ChargersFan4Life001::no
LobCityCP32BG32::you're right...they might be even worse...at least the old clippers were entertaining
Ailurophobia::I told everyone that the Grizz would surprise the League and that the Knicks were an unknown. No one freaking listened.
ute-jazz for life::wonder y
Jail Blazer::I could go for some nachos and a slurpee right now

Delontes Alter Ego::Best freshman in the country = Ben Mclemore  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHeM9WPOqEI
ChargersFan4Life001::jimmer does not suck, he should play more than IT right now
ute-jazz for life::his number this year look like what
kingsdynasty12::brooks sucks
sklater::He's a speaker of truth, not an idiot.  Brooks has not been doing well.
Ailurophobia::You're an idiot.
Ailurophobia::I told you before the season that Brooks should play before IT and you downed me.
ChargersFan4Life001::i didnt expect IT to play this bad, but right now jimmer is playing better than both

ChargersFan4Life001::jimmer deserves to play more
XCbeza3.0::those dudes suck though

kingsdynasty12::jimmer has a great attitude
ute-jazz for life::anyone but boogie.... i agree
Ailurophobia::Boogie needs to grow. I completely agree. Do I think Jimmer is the answer? NO
Ailurophobia::Brooks or Hayes should be the leader.
Ailurophobia::You have joined the cult
kingsdynasty12::u mean im on the jimmer board lol

GrandmasBoyBro858::80% of black people are on Foodstamps!
GrandmasBoyBro858::ok 85%?
NoOnGlutenLA::The internet hides your identity but not your ignorance.
Delontes Alter Ego::Mr. Trump, is that you?

LACLIPPERSFANSINCE1994::Anyone that says passed instead of past clearly didn't get past the second grade.
LobCityCP32BG32::you would know
Ailurophobia::Oh, and Jimmer will be gone in February.

itsatrap123::Yeah he'll probably take a road trip with the team if that's what you mean by gone.
Ailurophobia::NO, he'll be trade with Tyreke.
