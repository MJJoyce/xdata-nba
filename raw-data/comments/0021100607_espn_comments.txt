bell_alex2001::Oh <b>s</b>hit I didn't know that the Lakers were losing to the Grizzlies.  Woa.
pooor rangers::cavs still suck .
knicks_11::does anyone else see that  Lowry has the same jumpshot as D.Rose??
CandySparker::Hola Lotta Love!
robertloggia16::Knock knock  Who's there?  Cleveland.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Only ONE game out of the playoffs!!!
BringbackDtrain::heat fan here, irving and thompson look legit, cleveland has a bright future.
Chris287907::What? A good heat fan. I bet you were a fan before lebron went there. B
brutang77::Irving is the MOST clutch player in the NBA hands down!!!!
benga4lebron::yup, all of a sudden he is "sick"     dragic is not bad either, he been ballin.    get pau now, rockets are barely in 8th spot. the way the roster is now, they aren't going to win, might as well gamble with pau and give up lowry.
yorkdoggto::dwight demanded orlando trade for nash, and apparently ther close to a deal.... rest of the league better watch out http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
Giggity.iggity::It's gonna be tough for management to convince Kyrie that they're trying to build a winning team when they trade his backup PG and Jamison (AKA, the 3rd and 4th best players on the team).. The more I think about it, I kind of hope they don't.
ClevelandsPOWND::Jamisons not going to get bought out by the Cavs. He'll finish this season here and see what direction the FO wants to go. He (Jamison) also stated he wouldn't mind staying in CLE. Sessions is the only trade commodity we have.
mfj1010::teams that finish #7 thru #9 are stuck in purgatory forever. keep 2,13,17 &amp; 33. everyone else...bye, bye.
CTownHiLo::r u kidding? I would push Jamison off the cliff myself. Sure hes playing great right now but he's done - huge money and wont sustain this level of play. If we make the playoffs this year thats great experience for Kurie but no way we make it out of the first round. If we come close then we just moved DOWN in the draft. So trade Jamison if you can, trade sessions, and just cut gibson. Don't even ask me about Casspri and Erden....
cardinalsballer23::why in god's name would you cut daniel gibson? you obviously have NO idea what you are talking about. you might be one of the biggest morons ive ever seen. PATHETIC...
DyersEve06::Sessions isn't going to exercise his option just to be a backup.  Better to get something for him than just let him walk.
Giggity.iggity::Very true..  Hopefully they hold onto Jamison, though.
PK819::To Daryl Morey, Seeing the rockets stuck in a state of mediocrity is getting very old. I would like to see some rebuilding being done instead of just hoping a bunch of average players will take you anywhere in this league each and every year. Sincerely, a concerned fan.
benga4lebron::yup, all of a sudden lowry is "sick"     dragic is not bad either, he been ballin. would be great as their permanent starter.   get pau now, rockets are barely in 8th spot. the way the roster is now, they aren't going to win, might as well gamble with pau and give up lowry.
1ooclicck::swang on 4s wit me!!
1mproperDancing::I have to say...of all the recent games on the Cavs' schedule, these were three of the ones I thought they were least likely to win.  Nice to see them playing with some energy after that losing streak.
yata9arasu::Missed the game.....  :/  Great win Cavs!  Good game Houston!  Kyrie was great in the 4th again!  16 pts!!!  WOW!
KingGeorge53::tough loss for the rockets and their fans.  Go Cavaliers!
LP4TTU::Houston...We have a problem.
XxLeprechaunxX::Nice work Cleveland!  Signed  Delusional Twolf fan
ThaPriceisRight::Still a mystery to me why Kevin Martin is still in Houston
SRStark20::Kyrie will be the best point guard in the NBA in two more seasons.
BMS092::Maybe if Jordan swallows, Stern may be leinant?
cardinalsballer23::that was a stupid comment bro...
1mproperDancing::The Bobcats aren't even good enough to win the lottery.
BMS092::Bobcats - 2012 Lottery Champions! And with the first pick, they select Festus Ezelli!
BMS092::Just like Adam Morrison right? I guess Kwame Brown became the next Karl Malone right? Hey, maybe Jordan found someone who can at least score more than 5 ppg.
cland4ever::as the bobcats have what 5 wins?
UltraBobcatsFan20::kemba wuld hit them 3s deep in ur Q  GO BOBCASTS   NBA CHAMPIONS -2012!
SRStark20::The Bobcats will be lucky to get three more wins.
cardinalsballer23::yeah because the bobcats only lost what? like 20 some in a row right? good try though bro.
UltraBobcatsFan20::Y-E-I-E Y-E-IO  yayayaya  kemba &gt; cleveland   kemba culd beat the cavs by himself hes soooo good
rockinvette88::Another Southerner who still hasn't grasped the concept of spelling.
cardinalsballer23::you are stupid!
babaganoosh7492::Who are all of these chumps to say that Cleveland is trashy or classless?
UltraBobcatsFan20::KEMBA IS BETTR!  He scord like 49 pts the othr day
SRStark20::Maybe in ten games.
cardinalsballer23::your a moron.
UltraBobcatsFan20::EXCUSE ME! BUT I THINK THAT KEMBA WALKER WILL B THE MUCH BETTR PG WHEN HE IS BETTR  KYRIE IS A HICK  SORRY CLEVELAND BUT HE ISNT GOOD HAHAHAHA  GO BOBCATS!
The Land of Cleve::Seriously?  A hick?  He's probably one of the most well-spoken guys in the NBA, and he went to Duke.
duke of early bird::and cleveland and dan gilbert will once again show their class when he bolts in 2016!
BMS092::Why would he bolt? Chris Paul would've never left if Byron was still there. And yep us Clevelanders were classless, we just had our hero, our homegrown superstar not just leave, but to leave in a nationally televised one hour special where he gloats on how a greener pasture lies somewhere else. I mean it's not like he planned it years ago, it just magically happened all 3 went to the same team. He never notified our team, never gave us a chance to spend our $21 mil on another FA, and worst of all threw a huge party when all three arrived. If anyones classless it's him. So we can't be mad when we are thrown under a bus? If wade left Miami I believe it'd be like Vancouver times 10. Enjoy your words LeBron because remember, "not one, not two, not three, four, five..," yup zero. Looks like Cleveland still has more championships then LeBron.
i liked this comment::i dislike your comment
TheTristanShow::Back to back games are just an excuse, Kevin McHale is right.  How could you be tired after sleeping in, eating lunch, and taking a pregame nap?
Madhouse_United::It can affect a game to an extent IMO. But overall I agree, a lot of fans use it as an excuse.
who is jim brown::they're ducking and dodging baby mommas and whatnot.. it wears them out
Madhouse_United::Interesting race for 8th. NY is only a game ahead of MIL and CLE.
Madhouse_United::CLE's next few games aren't too hard. Other than ATL. But they are as inconsistent as it gets.
who is jim brown::if karma has a hand in it... Kyrie has been nothing but the utmost professional since coming to Cleve.
Madhouse_United::It would be amazing if Irving won a title before Bron.
who is jim brown::Yes, but we finally seem to have a good core group of young players.. I think I can finally see where LeBJ leaving has helped the Cavs... Irving is the real king
who is jim brown::I wish Dwight would come to Cleveland and help us win a championship before Miami does, if they do  that alone, almost, would let me die a satisfied Cleveland fan
i liked this comment::you "duke of early bird",  are an idiot.......yes you are...

TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::And when Cleveland gets Andy back...
cleb976::I think Dragic shows a lot of potential as a starting Point Guard in the future...what do you all think?
CTownHiLo::I used to think Dragic could be a started also I also thought JJ Hickson could be an effective power forward...
cardinalsballer23::haha he was for one season...then he got cocky and we ditched him...kyrie is the one with the potential...for MVP...
TheTristanShow::I think they've been saying that for the last 3 years.
cleb976::When he gets more minutes he exceeds that by a long shot
TheTristanShow::Still... He's yet to average 8 ppg and 4 ast in his career. Solid backup though.
cleb976::Look at his stats as a starter for the past few years....they're very impressive.
DyersEve06::Could be a late bloomer.  Look at Kyle Lowry
i liked this comment::the rockets lost cuz they played last night, this is what the announcers said in the post game show........HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA, poor lil' rockets are tired..
DyersEve06::Rockets fans trying to say that being without Lowry was a bigger deal than the Cavs being without Varejao.  Lowry's replacement gave you 20 points and 8 assists.  Varejao's replacement put up a whopping 4 points and 3 rebounds while allowing Scola to score 30.  Houston still loses.
cardinalsballer23::haha yeah and there were two of them...
Doinnn::Kyrie Irving = Rookie Of The Year

jcr54321::LeBron has the most points in Cleveland Cavaliers history.

cardinalsballer23::Kyrie is 19 years old and he already has the balls to take the game-deciding shot...something lebitch has yet to find...
CTownHiLo::who is jimbrown I am so copying that - thanks man!  "he's lost... he wandered out of the nascar page and can't find his way back..."
ampbains::last comment was @ HiTide808
ampbains::Yeah, clearly that disaster of a Knicks team is going to stay far ahead of us.  LMAO.  Dude, how do you tie your shoes in the morning without strangling yourself?  I'm reminded of the Family Guy episode where Peter almost drowns in his soup.
HiTide808::Who gives a $@%!..cavs still aint going to the playoffs.
who is jim brown::he's lost... he wandered out of the nascar page and can't find his way back
DyersEve06::This guy knows the future.  Makes you wonder why he's on an ESPN message board.
who is jim brown::I approve of this post
ampbains::And in 39 games, Irving has already been more clutch than LeBron has in his entire career.
SportsFanfromNY::alright im out. but lets just clear something up. im sorry for hating on ur city. i wuz just having fun and i wuz a little jealous tat u guys are catching up on the knicks.  i dont want to offend the city of Cleveland and its fans. truth is, is that u guys are probably one of the most loyal fans ever. i mean if my teams sucks like tat i would no cheer them on.  u guys are in gud hands with Kyrie. and if Dan Gilbert can add another gud player than the Cavs really have a chance in the future. i hope u accept my apology.

The Land of Cleve::Byron Scott best coach in the NBA
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Andy comes back, a good draft pick in the interior and we could be onto something with a solid young core.
CTownHiLo::TT is 2 years out from being a reliable effective PF. By the time any young core develops here Jamison will be done so I say cut him now. Andy will be in his last stretch but still very effective with the new core so keep him. Gee will be in his full stride as a player so no brainer keep him. We still need alot but I like where we are headed.
DyersEve06::We need a wing player.  TT will be the PF of the future.
JohnsonnnL::Yea the upcoming draft looks like its going to be stacked with PFs
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Kyrie ROY
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Cavs are going in the right direction.
EricTheYank::SportsFanFromNY got raped by a transient in downtown Cleveland. That is why he has a vendetta against the city.

EricTheYank::Dog $@%! &gt; SportsFanfromNY.
EricTheYank::First two are true, but Cavs &gt; Knicks
EricTheYank::Won't be by the end of the season.
SportsFanfromNY::Knicks won a championship cavs havent Knicks hav the better record right now
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::In the last 30 years, NY has won 4 Stanley Cups, six World Series and four Lombardi trophies. But apparently, that's not enough to enjoy solely for it's own merit. I guess it's no fun unless you use it to make the rest of the world feel worse about it. If that's how you're supposed to act when your team wins...
SportsFanfromNY::not the rest of world just cleveland
SportsFanfromNY::CAVS, INDIANS, BROWNS all have one thing in common.  they all suck
etripp216::Only $@%!$@% type stuff for attention.

The Land of Cleve::Hey remember the playoff series gnat game when the wimpy yankees pitchers couldn't handle the bugs flying on them and blew the game?
EricTheYank::Duke Blue Devils blow.
SportsFanfromNY::Do Cleveland Fans actually think their teams are good?
JohnsonnnL::When was the last time the Knicks won a playoff game.
SportsFanfromNY::idk but at least we got the Giants and Yanks
matt_makela@yahoo.com::besides the Giants
SportsFanfromNY::no
matt_makela@yahoo.com::they didn't buy that?
SportsFanfromNY::Yanks 09
matt_makela@yahoo.com::when's the last time NY won a championship without buying it?
matt_makela@yahoo.com::Cavs 2 years ago, and not that long ago the Indians were a game away from going to the World Series...
SportsFanfromNY::Giants won the SB and they didnt buy any good players b4 the season when did any cleveland team make the playoffs?
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Do you actually feel better about yourself now?
EricTheYank::Do you actually think you are intelligent?
SportsFanfromNY::im sorry i didnt know i was in a spelling bee
SportsFanfromNY::well excuse me
EricTheYank::You still can't spell.
masteroftheboop::I don't think someone with a medical degree would say pretty gud. Maybe pretty well
SportsFanfromNY::well i guess im doing pretty gud
EricTheYank::Rich daddy, huh?
SportsFanfromNY::yes because im a pulmonologist who graduated from duke
SportsFanfromNY::its so easy making fun of cleveland fans because everything i say about the sports teams are true. for example, cleveland teams sucks
EricTheYank::Here is another fact: You have nothing better to do than troll boards. How sad is that?
matt_makela@yahoo.com::when's the last time the Knicks made it to the finals?
SportsFanfromNY::idr but i know the Giants won the SB and the Yank won the WS in 09 when did any Cleveland team win a championship
masteroftheboop::Congrats. A team you never played for or had any impact in is better than a team I never played for or had any impact in. You must have a pretty pathetic life if you are so proud of something someone else did.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::What do you plan to actually accomplish by ripping on Cleveland, dude?
EricTheYank::He gets his jollies doing this. He has nothing better to do, which tells you something.

billymitch14::how many turn overs did linnjoke have today??
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::We keep rooting for our team. Just like we did last year.
who is jim brown::I don't think Kyrie would act in the same manner as one Mr James, if he did choose to go elsewhere.   LeBJ didn't just leave Cleveland, he threw the entire city, fans, and most importantly his teamates under the 'bus'.
SportsFanfromNY::u guys will also probably burn his jersey and Dan Gilbert will write yet another letter hoping that Kyrie will never get a ring
SportsFanfromNY::wat is really funny is when cleveland fans think tat they can win a championship before Lebron does. LOL
billymitch14::ouch my elbow my elbow, nobody like me anymore boo hoo
SportsFanfromNY::zero but chances are is that he is going to win 1 this year or nxt yr
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Or that Jeremy Lin is an athlete.
billymitch14::How many has he won???
