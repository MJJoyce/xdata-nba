donald::Conley is being asked to carry more than just the Grizzlies, he's being asked to carry an entire state, that has nothing else to cheer for except Al Gore's invention of the internet.
Jao::Those bashin Kirk, he is +13 tonight. DJ is -8. There's more to basketball than points.
Anton::I take it back. Bulls look better without that overrated pretender D-Rose. Once Deng is back, it's Heinrich Jimmy Deng Boozer Noah and they will make playoffs and I think they can beat Indiana easily.
HavlicekStoleTheBall::How is Kirk Hinrich still a starting point guard in the NBA?  The guy is a train wreck!  Augustin has twice as much talent.
Greg Dizzle::Johnson has arrived! Just dropped McBob for him!
jzreal::Tony Snell!!
Amir::Well coached Memphis looks like average Euroleague team, any Hollins requirement wasn't exaggerated
Mike::I agree Hinrich belongs at the end of the bench.
mike::Put Franklin in, they need atheliticism
chris::I think the bulls should trade Boozer and M. Dunleavy
