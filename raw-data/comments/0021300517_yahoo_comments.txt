Be+::I would start Nate over some of the starting point guards in the league (not in Denver though).  He would pump up the energy as soon as the clock starts.  I find him exciting and inspirational to watch even though I've never lived in the cities he's played for.
Gary::well,I wonder who the Nuggets are going to trade Miller to and for who?  Wife and I were at the Grizz game and he wasn't even in the arena.  guess he hasn't even been at practices. whenever that happens to any player that usually means its gonna happen.
mark::Boston is starting to play like the garbage team I thought they were in the beginning of the season. luckily they have a very good young coach!
Pamela::This is sad, pathetic really. Jazz just beat Thunder and Celtics laid down for the Nuggets. Guess they have decided to blow what good they had going. Ainge sucks.
Army::Shaw has given up on the slowed-down, play-calling offense he was trying, and failing with,  for the running offense that George Karl was using successfully.  About time that Shaw caught on to the Players the Nuggets have, and the andvantages of the altitude.
.8734::Who didn't see this coming. A Boston team well on its way to another 50 loss season on the road against Western Conference team
Matthew::C'mon back Rondo -- I can't stand these terrible Jordan Crawford outings : /
EIGHT::Nate and the Nuggets just embarrassed the Lakers. Hopefully the Celtics show up
Gary::someone on another post, a fan said he heard from somewhere that the thunder is talking to the Nuggets about Miller to help them while the other guard, Westbrook is down for awhile
John::38.5% shooting... get real......make changes NOW ...
