Austin::Tony Parker got the night off and the only player to play more than 25 minutes tonight was Marco Belinelli, yet the Spurs still took care of business handily. Pop just knows how to get the best out of his team without fatiguing his team.
Sean::Spurs are a well oiled machine. They just win every year. What a great management team they have. Probably the best in all of pro sports.
Mr::No disrespect to the Magic, but I'm curious to see how the Spurs will approach this game. Will they go all out and inflict a heavy loss or will they conserve energy and rest it up for the Houston game tomorrow?   Either way, should be an interesting game.
Austin::Sooner Bill talks about how the Spurs can only beat bad teams and under performs against good teams, but OKC has had the same dilemma. OKC has played the Jazz twice, the Pistons, Wizards, Bucks and Nuggets, but lost to elite teams like the Clippers and Warriors and even lost to Minnesota!  Just some facts here, Spurs are 6-2 against above .500 teams and OKC is 5-3 against above .500 teams. So Sooner Bill can take his stupid argument andstick it where the sun don't shine, cuz the Spurs are the real deal!  Go Spurs Go!!!!
BSupreme::Afflalo would be a cool fit for the Kings. Give Orlando anything but picks and Cousins
I Am The World's Most Interesting Man::And that's why I dropped Danny Green off my fantasy team, but I have a hunch that Pop could give a rat's #$%$ about Fantasy Basketball!
SOONER BILL::Good News ! Spurs get to play another sub 500 team tonight ! So they will look awesome tonight untill they play an Elite team again then it will be another off night and the refs that cheated them .
Anton::Spurs are going to make the Finals again but will lose to Miami again.
Commenter::Like I said, Spurs beat weak to average teams but the losses they have now are from elite teams. They can't beat the Thunder (7-2 in last 9 games vs Spurs), Heat, Pacers, nor Blazer in a best of 7 games. Where were the Spurs fans when they CHOKED in the Finals? Prentis P, Tay, BB, Terry, Shaw, Phillip, Straitballin, Chapscat, Moses, Donald, proudveteranwoman, Guest, etc? I watched NBA for 27 years & I never seen a team so pathetic & choke like the Spurs. Double digit lead in the 4th, up by 5 with 28 seconds left, Leonard missed 1 freethrow to close out the Finals & Pop took out his rebounders & starters at the end like an idiot! They CHOKED as USUAL LOL. THIS IS THE 5TH SEASON I WILL SAY IT, SPURS WON'T WIN THE TITLE! HAVE FUN REPLYING TO YOURSELVES CAUSE I WON'T COME BACK TO READ IT LOL 2014- Will CHOKE in the playoffs 2013- CHOKED in game 6 after having the game won & CHOKED against the Heat in Game 7 2012- CHOKED losing 4 straight games after winning 20+ games straight, best record in the west, & being up 2-0 with home court advantage. BIGGEST CHOKE IN HISTORY! PATHETIC! 2011- CHOKED in the 1st round to a 8th seeded team after having the best record in the west!
