srqman1::do miami trolls still think that the heat laid down for the knicks because of hurricane sandy?  thats some clown shoes sh*t right there
srqman1::i have ties to brooklyn, but i'm sorry to say - net fans - it's all about DA KNICKS  we gonna win the championship dis year
elcappytan::thank you Brooklyn..i couldnt take one more season of Joe Johnson
Miami Sports Rock::Much Deeper Bench For us Heat.
ESPN BANNED MY ALABAMA ACCOUNT::WHAT DOES ALABAMA AND OBAMA HAVE IN COMMON??? THEY BOTH HAVE BAMA IN THEIR NAME....    ALABAMA   OBAMA    THATS WHY ALABAMA FOOTBALL RULES BIACHES
have you seen my teddy bear::or the entire system favors them....duh
Jamaal 43::Damn, yall got killed lol Yall can lose to the Heat but not by 30
jrtall3n7::I know rite. Joe Johnson hasn't been doing much so far. Hopefully they start clicking after 10/15 games or so.
lebron-is-a-champion::go heat!!!
jint323::the knicks are singing " we got 99 problems but the nets aint one" hahahahaha
eagleshave0rings::they are the same crappy team as last year with the addition of joe J. this should surprise no one

Mark12081959::Lebron haters can suckit!!!!
NbaNflBoxing Lover::Lebron Just get the triple-double already!!!
MiamiFan2004::Plus, he technically got a couple more assists if you count hockey assists, meaning quick pass to quick pass to shot.  http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/15718/the-heat-and-the-hockey-assist
Rambomonster9::he cant when he only plays half the game
ElNinoDorado15::99 problems...  and the Nets are one.
ryyyang::The Bulls 72 - 10 record could be in jeopardy
MiamiFan2004::If he said they would make it, you would claim he was a delusional fanboy. When he says they won't make it, you claim he is saying the heat "didn't try".    He is being OBJECTIVE and HONEST in saying that the Heat will likely NOT make it because they have been taught by Riley and Spoelstra that the #1 seed and the top regular season record is WORTHLESS.  They will likely be the #1 seed, but that is due to the fact that teams like Boston are struggling to beat the Wizards.
method305::Nah. 65-67 wins at most.
method305::At least were not lat in our conference like the Fakers.
Full Season Heat::There we go - the heat simply "don't try"
IlyaKol::Agreed. Personally I think they will fall just short of 60 because Miami is traditionally a team that doesn't give a crap about the regular season when they are built to go deep in the playoffs. The only time they try all season long is when they are a bubble team like the Heat team that had Wade, Beasley, etc.  This team knows it can coast and will do so.
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::Its possible...my Knicks havent lost yet
NbaNflBoxing Lover::The Knicks had better focus on getting out of the 1st round...
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::Plus this aint a condensed season
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::We got like 15 of em...aint worried about the rotation
SouthFLAnative::knicks will come back down to reality. wait until the midpoint when those old rusty bodies start fading away.
IAMLEGEND_101::NETS LET THE HEAT WIN

method305::I don't think that's gonna help.
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::Let's see...NYK, minus 2 starters, and a backup C, blow MIA out by 20....  BKN, minus 1 Crash Bandicoot, gets blown out by MIA by 30....  Yes, BKN is the best team in NY...
SouthFLAnative::Hurricane sandy pumped the Knicks up
jayboyd88::knicks fan are acting like they won a championship lmao...reality check losers, you stand no chance of going anywhere in the post season...LBJ is getting ring #2 this year.
method305::1st, I didn't know Chandler was their back-up. 2nd Miami didn't play that game. It was the Hurricane Sandy relief crew in those Heat uni's. They even donated some of the proceeds to NY. 3rd, who's Crash Bandicoot on the Nets? Wallace?
Full Season Heat::Nets didn't play in this one

gigantic::We never should have given the Knicks that gift-wrapped sympathy win last week. Just seemed like the right thing to do at the time. That's what we get for being kind-hearted. No more of that foolishness. We only have ten losses to give out so we'll be more discreet about who we give them to from here on.
MiamiFan2004::See, just scrolled down and there it was, your claim that he is delusional for thinking Miami has a shot at the 72 win mark.  How many wins do YOU think Miami is gonna get this year, oh font of troll wisdom?
Full Season Heat::proof that heat fans are delusional
sources says::what has Dwill done as a Net to justify being considered top 3 pg in the league. because he can score? I thought his role was to set up his players making them better. not setting up his own shot.
joshuadhickman03::I agree but that should be applied to Pg's like rose and westbrook as well Dwill has similar skill set as Cp3 we just haven't seen it in a couple years
chocolate covered caterpillars::lol williams 14.33 PER so far this year. absolutely pathetic.  chalmers at 12.65 HA
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::Hopefully Amar'e is back by Dec 6th....maybe the Heat can make it a better game LOL
method305::That's the last thing you'd wanna hope for. All he's gonna do is get mad they lost to the Heat... again and break another Fire extinguisher case.
joshuadhickman03::he could be a volunteer fire fighter and was just trying to put out the Heat we don't have all the facts yet
chocolate covered caterpillars::chalmers deserves some credit for how the heat are playing as well. he is no longer a liability and is now considered by most coaches around the league a solid starting point guard on any team. after averaging about 3.6 assists through his first 4 seasons, he's averaging 6.6 this year through 5 games. though his 3 point shooting percentage is still pretty good, if he can get his overall shooting percentage up then it will only make the heat that much harder to defend.
method305::Very true. Chalmers is coming through
Dickiedave2.0::Pat Riley always said that the initial Heat team in 2010-2011 would be it's worst. And that team lost in the finals. So far he's been absolutely correct as usual.    He really is the Godfather.
ItsOnLikeDonkeyKongBiachh::I coined the phrase "Rasheedsanity". ---------------------------------------------------- That's a terrible phrase and is very unoriginal. First Knicks fans overhype Jeremy Lin, and now a hobbling Sheed. He's a shell of his former self.

LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::LOL hhahahaha

gigantic::What's with this crap?
method305::Well the Knickerbocker fans are gonna continue to think that they actually have a shot a beating the Heat in a playoff series this year and because you're still recovering from the Sandy, we'll give it to you, for now. However, when they come to Miami for the first actual game between the 2, you'd better get ready for a reality check.
sources says::reality check, Knicks blew Miami out. fantasy check, WAIT till the Knicks play Miami in Miami.
method305::^Sense, this post makes none.^
HeatOriginal::It has been so long the fans in New York got anything from the Knick to be hyped about so we all should understand them getting so excited after playing just two teams. Not smart but understandable. They need to remember the season is long and can be extremely difficult on OLD players. The Knicks early schedule is easy on the old guys, lot of rest days in between games. Give the rest of NBA loving fans time before we accept this team as a championship quality team
sources says::fact, Knicks have one player over 30 as a starter.
ItsOnLikeDonkeyKongBiachh::LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace Not only beat but whooped on you and took your players paychecks --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LOL how classless can someone get? What have you donated? Damn, I wish your house would've gotten destroyed in the hurricane.
JB305187::Yea who else
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::You dont remember me?? I coined the phrase "Rasheedsanity". I was the one who started "just cause the game looked like Globetrotters v Generals doesn't mean its a charity game"...hard to realize you dont remember me out of 5000+ comments

JB305187::It was only a  sympathy win it kinda reminded me of last years play offs when we didn't sweep you   You guys had to get rid that old $@% confetti

Joeschmo loves Heat::So someone mentioned it so let's talk about Knicks 3pt shooting.   Right now they are incredibly hot from the 3pt line. But do you honestly believe that it will last?  Carmelo is 33% 3pt shooter in his career (average at best). Brewer shoots 25% in his career. Kidd is at 35%. JR Smith is 37%.  My point is that outside of Novak (who is freaking awesome at 3s), nobody on that team is reliable enough to keep up that shooting effort. And let's be honest, without the 3s they've made so far... they would be 1-2 at best.
method305::J.R. is but as previously stated, it doesn't matter. The Knicks will not make it too far.
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::Have you been watching the games??? I could make those open threes with the penetration that they are getting

method305::Delusional thinking.
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::ECF
Joeschmo loves Heat::kinda like Knicks fans were calling for a Miami sweep last year. How did that go?

LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::Dont tell me sorry now...tell me sorry when it happens. Better believe I will be here ;)
ItsOnLikeDonkeyKongBiachh::Not really that great of an explanation LosLobos.

method305::yup
yourmothersmustache::what funny is I wrote the Knicks have a shot, and espn bleeped it out
yourmothersmustache::Joeschmo loves Heat - They don't like liars.  You're an idiot.  Keep hating on real fans who love their team.  Im sure youll hop on another bandwagon in 3 years anyway
Joeschmo loves Heat::They don't like liars.
yourmothersmustache::The Knicks have a $@%! to be one of the better defensive team this year.  Its all about the system, and they are in a system that is all about D.  I doubt abnyone is saying they are the best, after 3 games that would be $@%!$@%!.  However saying the Knicks are the best 3 point shooting team in the league is not a stretch at all.
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::Notice to all Heat fans who didnt get the memo in game one: These are Woodys Knicks....DEFENDERS not D'Antoni Prenteders
method305::Memo from Heat fans:  It doesn't matter. Come playoff time the Knicks will still lose, probably by the hands of the Heat or the Celts.
major red::lmao, when amare comes back say goodbye to that.
Joeschmo loves Heat::You stay up all night thinking of that one?
major red::If you make 43 3's in 3 games I would hope you would be 3-0.
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::DEFENSE
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::if they let us then why not?
Joeschmo loves Heat::If you rely on the 3 that much, you're setting up to be last year's Orlando (without a Dwight Howard)

Joeschmo loves Heat::Answer: 1
yourmothersmustache::Joeschmo loves Heat - I didn't mind. i was confident that he would reverse that. Until he won that ring, he had to deal with it because those people were fully justified in their thinking based on what they had seen from him in the past. Just as I am fully justified now.   Don't like it? Have the knicks prove me wrong.  Ok cool I'll go talk to them

yourmothersmustache::Everyone was hating on the Heat and Lebron, saying things like Lebron will never win, blah , blah, blah.  You as a Heat fan probably hated it as you should of and defended Lebron.  Now you are using the same tactics on Knicks fans?  Our team is drastically improved.  Get off our N*ts man.  Why does the idea of our success bother you?
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::How is that relevant to now and THIS YEARS 3-0 team that smashed the Heat?
joshuadhickman03::this is basketball not college football 3-0 starts mean absolutely nothing
yourmothersmustache::_Furious_ - How is this year's Knicks team substantially different from last year's Knicks team?   How is beating Miami in a regular season game in November relevant to winning a playoff series?  And to answer your question:  Totally upgraded backcourt NEW COACH, NEW SYSTEM (Coach D preached 7 seconds or less, no D) Coach Woodson is ALL about team defense and it shows.  Thats like asking what the difference would be between Thibs and D'Antoni coaching the Bulls.
yourmothersmustache::_Furious_ - How is this year's Knicks team substantially different from last year's Knicks team?   How is beating Miami in a regular season game in November relevant to winning a playoff series?  Are you serious man?  Listen we get youre a hater.  NYC is the greatest city in the world and most of you have a hard time dealing with that so you hate.  You are entitled to your opinion, if you dont like the Knicks thats fine.  Do you honestly not know how the team is different though?  I mean you're kidding right?
method305::Damn, you Knicks fans are delusional.

Joeschmo loves Heat::What mattes more? Playoff record or the first 3 games of a season.
jint323::how many times has lebron lost in the finals? exactly anything can be changed in one year.
method305::LOL
Joeschmo loves Heat::Right, but you guys haven't changed it for 12 years.
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::Knicks whooped the Heat baaaad....The Heat gave us that game alright but only after they tried their hardest for 3 quarters and still werent close
LosLobosKickUrBallsIntoOuterSpace::Just cause it looked like Globetrotter vs Generals doesnt mean it was a charity game bruh
method305::Uh...., yeah it does son. Like i said the Heat weren't gonna tear up NY after all he Sandy stuff had just happened. I'm not gonna lie the Knicks were feeling the it, mostly due to the ruckus crowd and the atmosphere, but you saw it in the Heat players faces. As soon as the game started, they checked out.
method305::Keep believing that was an actual game and not a mercy game that the Heat gave the Knicks. Wade even said it himself that they should not play that game, then proceeded to give his game check to NY for their relief fund. C,mon man.
Butta412::This $@%! is not $@%!$@% fair. Lebron might not eclipse 35 pts this season. He wont have to. I say he'll average about 24-25 a game. This is Nucking Futs! They might beat the Bulls record for most games won, You heard it here first.
KinickDiaz::I SMOKED A JOINT UNDER WATER ONCE
method305::lol
jint323::not happening
n1que_olajuwon_ewing::i bet i can throw a football over them mountains!
jint323::knicks will win 50+ games, win the atlantic division, and be a top 3 seed in the east. THE NETS WILL DO NONE OF THESE THINGS HAHAHAHAHA
