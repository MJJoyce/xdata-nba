diehardnr1::What a difference a Dago makes!  While Gallo was not the star tonight, his key makes, foul shot producing drives.... and D have been sorely missed.    Faried earned his nickname in this game!  GO NUGGETS!!!
Heat 4 Bulls 1::GOOD TO SEE GALLO BACK
rschuyler85::Faried &gt; Howard
TitanYork::If I did not watch this game and read this headline I would think the nuggets barely won because of Gallo. Gallo did not Will them to a win Faried Blew up in a Blow out! Nuggets are a bi-polar team when they are hot they can complete with anyone and when they are not they can't beat anyone and they have proved that.
CUBurnett753::Great win by the Nuggs especially after the L to Golden State a couple nights ago.  With 9 left to play, I would much rather see the Nuggs get up to the 6 seed in the West or miss the playoffs altogether.  Not sure i can stomach another 1st round disaster at the hands of the Spurs or Thunder
Frenchy2001147::anyone else notice faried got his 27-17 in just 24 games...he only played half of the game!
jason_bautista::i wonder if they kept jeremy instead of the jenkins...
2012ChampsBulls::dear espn... its danillo gallinari of italy NOT spain
Paul96857::Ali44, I think this team has been running great since he said http://bit.ly/IdCjtx
sports guy12::Kenneth Faried is an absolute beast
b2msbro::What the &amp;*^$%#@! the one game I miss and the nuggets destroy it.  Kenneth faried 27/17 are you kidding me!?
b2msbro::Haha seriously
JustineS04::Maybe miss more?
Sollam4456::gallo&gt;melo
Latino_sportsguy::stop sniffn crack
Heiroglyphic::Hopefully these guys can feed off this win and start playing inspired ball and begin to peak at the right time heading into the playoffs. I would love to carry a nice win streak into the postseason. GO NUGS!
diehardnr1::This hope has kept me going the last month...just get healthy and peak at the right time!
Heiroglyphic::Impressive win Nugs. Definitely needed this one too, with PHX, UTAH, and HOU also winning tonight.
wiqdgato::wow nugs come back and hit gsw straight up the mouth. das what i be talking abouT. capital T.
gary wheatley::see ya slurm, talk to ya wed nite after the game
dredubs99::Come son of jor el kneel before Zod!
Meet Friar Manning::snootchie bootchies
Slurm Soda::bye
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::I'm out too, GO KNICKS! Hopefully Nuggets lose. lol naah but good luck .
gary wheatley::anyway, well yall, think im gonna call it a night.  hope to talk to yall wed night hopefully another win
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Is Tulo a big star over there?
gary wheatley::just kind of MELO.  Rocks are kind of big here but this is a Bronco Town.  but he is one of the fav rockies players no doubt
JustineS04::They'll be good again if the FO doesn't blow it. It's a very young team.
gary wheatley::and of course the Avs suck,  they didnt make the playoffs again this yr.  I use to be a big hockey fan here when Roy,Sakic, Forsberg, Borque was here and they won the 2 cups but since then they have sucked
JustineS04::Huge.
JustineS04::They chant his name at Avs' games even.
gary wheatley::well slurm all i have to say is they know there is only 9 games left and they cant slack off anymore. I hope they really get that in their head
Slurm Soda::Most of the times I can't stand Al is when him and Miller are on the court at the same time.
JustineS04::Agree, but I think that's GK's fault.
muncieplumbers::<img src="http://www.ibdguy.com/images/hoglogo2.gif">
Poke6447::what is it about denver and new york?
gary wheatley::what you mean Poke?
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Is just fun and games. But yeah Melo rocks
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::They were up by 21, its a disgrace that it ended up being that close.
gary wheatley::I know he had a monster game the other night against the bulls but they needed everyone of them,  didnt they win by 1 point in overtime
gary wheatley::and wow I saw something tonight in the last quarter, granted they were up by alot, but Karl actually had 2 7 footers in the game at the same time.  And it actually worked good.  where the heck has he been before tonight?  that one play in the 4th quarter when McGee and Mazgoff were in at the same time they had 3 blocks together on just that one play
JustineS04::Well, you see, you play 2 PGs when you're getting outrebounded, and 2 7-footers when you're destroying the other team on the boards. It makes perfect sense.
gary wheatley::lol slurm
gary wheatley::so Slurm, did they say or did you read anything about what is gonna happen with Al?  I know he can be a bonehead at times but man you have to admit he is a vetran leader and he can give you points in times if you really need them.
Slurm Soda::Yeah I like him sometimes, but other times I can't stand him.
JustineS04::But I think it's mostly GK's fault he plays him too much and leaves him in, rendering him ineffective. We'd always love him if GK used him appropriately.
gary wheatley::anyway, getting back to your question Slurm , if Al does miss time I dont know whatKarl will do.  Hell do we EVER know what Karl is going to do, lol.  If Chandler comes back maybe, Hamilton maybe, I just hope its not Brewer
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Agree on Tebow, seems like a nice guy but theres a difference between barely making the playoff qbs and super bowl qbs.
amiller244::Nolan Smith over Kenneth Faried....yet another draft blunder for the Blazers. The Mavs kill us on the boards and knock us out of the playoffs, then 2 months later, after trading for a starting PG, instead of drafting the best rebounder in the nation, we draft a backup PG who was projected to go in the second round.
amiller244::Yeah, but didn't the Blazers make that trade partly to move ahead of the Nuggets in the draft order? They really had to make that move to secure Nolan Smith?
Slurm Soda::haha has Nolan Smith even been decent this year?
Slurm Soda::But hey it looks like the Felton-Miller trade ended up being bad for both.
amiller244::Don't thank me, thank our dumba$$ front office who hasn't even hired a permanent GM yet and promoted a 33-year old who was a video intern a couple years ago to head coach. I just hope we don't waste our high pick from NJ on Andre Drummond (assuming he leaves), as of right now he just looks like Hasheem Thabeet 2.0...
Slurm Soda::I was surprised Faried fell down to the Nuggets pick.... best rebounder since Duncan in college, you would think he would go higher even if he was on a bad team
JustineS04::Thanks!
gary wheatley::just what you need there in New York huh NY, more Jets contrevisery
gary wheatley::just one thing on the Tebow thing ok    I had fun like everyone else watching him but I truely knew he wasnt going to be the future qb here, even though others said different.  He was McDoufass pick when he was the coach.  Elway and Fox wasnt around.  It pissed off alot of people here when they got rid of him and got Manning but LORD, here's your sign people.  Tebow or future hall of famer??? Hello!!!!  Manning at 70% is way over Tebow anyday of the week
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Tebow will never be bigger than the Yankees, nobody is.
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Anthony is not the first uperstar not cause of Tebow but because of the Yankees son lol
BrownBagDenver::Tebow will be bigger than the Yankees...just wait...once football season starts you are going to HATE the Jets.
gary wheatley::wow  the Tebow thing, I dont want to even get started on that lol
Slurm Soda::Karl will cry himself to sleep if Al has to miss games
JustineS04::Who will he play at the 5 if Al is out? Faried?
Slurm Soda::Who knows.... whatever he does it will be stupid.
BrownBagDenver::The question I have....how will Melo handle being the second biggest superstar in New York??? ITS TEBOW TIME!!!
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Lol you funny.
gary wheatley::Justine, he must have torn it the other night in Golden State
JustineS04::Two games ago would've been Phoenix. Maybe it was Orlando.
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Bronx
gary wheatley::I have never been to NY other than Buffalo some yrs back.  I would like to see it some day.  Wife retires at the end of August so maybe some day. One of her best friends is in Philly.  she worked with her here some yrs back so maybe we will kill 2 birds with one stone so to speak
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Buffalo is part of Ny but is not the first place you think about when you think N.Y.
JustineS04::Al Harrington has a torn meniscus.
BrownBagDenver::With Gallo back we can afford that...plus Mosgov looked good...
JustineS04::He's going to play through it. It happened a couple games ago. http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2012/04/09/nuggets-al-harrington-torn-meniscus/6265/
gary wheatley::really Justine?  is he going to play thru it or is he going to have to have it scoped?
Slurm Soda::Ugh what did I say at the beginning of the game about someone getting hurt
gary wheatley::so where bouts are you in NY Mello
gary wheatley::oh ok MELO
gary wheatley::yes we did, and the city imbrased him.  It wasnt until the way the contract situation started.  and from what some of the press said, course you know what press people write about, lol, that his demnor really changed. and it really affected the team and teammates.  more times than not then he didnt want to speak or comment to anyone.  course he has the right not to.  I mean the Nuggs offered a boatload of cash like he got in NY but he flat turned it down
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::I'm talking about that baby blue and white, it looks good. Its up there with Golden State and Knicks .
gary wheatley::what uniform you talking about MELO?  sorry I lost you
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Was Melo beloved by you guys in Denver? like did you  go crazy over him when he was there . Be honest.
BrownBagDenver::He was not "beloved"...he was a fan favorite...Denver is a Broncos town first...the Nuggets are behind the Rockies...and just ahead of the Avalanche.
BrownBagDenver::@Slurm Back in the day...the Avs are close to being overtaken by the Rapids...
BrownBagDenver::If you looked at jersey sales in Denver; #1 Elway #2 Tulowitzki #3 Melo
Slurm Soda::lol but when the Avs are in the playoffs maybe only the Broncos beat them in fan support
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Got it.
Slurm Soda::It wasn't like Roy or Sakic love, or Elway, or Helton. I don't like the way he plays (except in WCF run) so I didn't necessarily love him. I didn't want him to leave because I thought we would end up like the Cavs
gary wheatley::we have all 4 major sports here but not a big metropolist as NY City
gary wheatley::they intervied gallo at the begining of the yr and asked him one reason he likes it here.  He said cause its smaller and really doesnt have the pressure here like in NY.  not near as many reporters around him almost 24/7. you know what im saying NY
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::I like teasing the Nuggets but they are kool i guess, i always liked the uniforms. Hopefully they can miss the playoffs so i can brag about MElo
BrownBagDenver::You realize that the Knicks are barely hanging on right?
Slurm Soda::http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;rlz=1C1CHJX_enUS421US421&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=667&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=wKiz458KLiLDYM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1104716-power-ranking-every-nba-teams-retro-threads&amp;docid=_tWhBuk890FArM&amp;imgurl=http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/002/028/628/apple_display_image.jpg%253F1331750902&amp;w=350&amp;h=290&amp;ei=-7aDT5rYHYGe2AXy_MT_CA&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=736&amp;vpy=106&amp;dur=339&amp;hovh=204&amp;hovw=247&amp;tx=189&amp;ty=99&amp;sig=110561154199383088952&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=141&amp;tbnw=171&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=16&amp;ved=1t:429,r:9,s:0,i:89  I like these jerseys the most
Slurm Soda::Just like it haha
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::Lol whatz good with that uniform, you wore that today?
gary wheatley::I like coming on here and saying my opinion on some things but I try to stay away from some of these comments.  everyone has an opinion and has the right to express it.  Im not bashing anyone for sure cause there really shouldnt be any
gary wheatley::thats just like the big buzz around here in denver now with Peyton Manning here.  Its all over town. T Shirts and Jersys are showing up everywhere. I need to get me mine.  People are writing here they wish is was July cause thats when the Broncos training camp starts
MELO IS THE KING OF NYC::This is why i go over board with this Nuggets fans, cause of people like brownbagdenver
Slurm Soda::Haha the reason all this happens is because at the beginning of the season Knicks fans vs Nugget fans was crazy here. I thought the rivalry died after the Nugget-Knick game but I guess not.
BrownBagDenver::There is no rivalry...Denver got rid of Melo...and his wife...and his inability to win...and in return got great young talent and lots of cap space. New York...still can't compete with the big boys.
BrownBagDenver::Hey...we suck with no superstars...whats your excuse???
BrownBagDenver::Denver gets rid of Melo, is currently in 8th place in the West.   New York gets Melo, they are currently 7th in the East...  The difference...New York was supposed to be dominant  Denver Nuggets Ball Boy &gt; Melo
