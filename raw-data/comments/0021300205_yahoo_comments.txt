Can't Belive He Just Said That.::Oh and I just noticed but hes about to break into the top 30 all time in 3 cats. total points, total assists and total steals and perhaps field goals made. Hes already up there in points per game(3) on track to end his career top 3,
Jibbs::James, 11-14 for 35 points.  Someone, please tell Kobe that its possible to score 30 plus points without taking 25 shots.  Wade, 9-13 and 12 ast.  When the Heat are playing this way there really is no stopping them.  Keep up the HIGH QUALITY basketball.  unreal.  James is just amazing with his efficiency as a player.
Ify::I'm thrilled with the high free throw percentage. Means they are concentrating in the game
TinyT::Closer then most think! Heat 96-88! Heat usually don't play great against below average teams
fcbonilla::A young Suns team that is still trying to find themselves vs a dangerous Heat team on a six game winning streak. I wonder how this will play out.
mark Gamon::Ray Allen is an early candidate for the Sixth Man of the Year!
Ruben::Not so slowly but surely Beasley's working his way deeper into the rotation. That means he's gaining the trust of his mates and coaches on DEFENSE. If that development continues Haslem will have a tough time getting minutes. After the All-Star break it'll be Oden's turn to try out his rehabilitated knees. If that works out, Indiana can go 81-1 but Miami will three-peat.
PKM::Another game for Miami to play the B squad?
luis::Go suns
Wake Up::Yeah, Beasley played well and is working himself into the rotation. If he ever gets his head straight, he will be a monster. Couldn't ask for better role models in LeBron and DWade.
