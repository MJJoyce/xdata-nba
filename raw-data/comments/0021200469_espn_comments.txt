MikeyP7773::Did anyone else see that at the end of the Heat VS Bulls game (with about 2-3 min. To go) D Wade was ready to take over and Lebron pretty much ignored it and lost the game for the Heat? Review the tape. D Wade even hit a 3 and was not givin the ball next time down the floor. If the Heat want to dominate again and not worry about "being big" they need to have an even time share of leadership between D Wade and Lebron. Wade was 7-11 from the field and ready to dominate. Listen to his post game interview, read between the lines, D Wade is ready to claim half the Heat again. Lebron is great, but together with D Wade they are unstoppable. Lebron needs to realize again why they all came together and share the lead. D Wade is truly the heart and soul of this Miami Heat team.

HeatLaughAtRegularSeason::Did the SHE Troll get suspended Again?
HeatLaughAtRegularSeason::Here SHE comes right on cue!
Djuki 3::that depends if you were flagging him =P
nba is the worst::ha ha, talk about obsessed
Aicyla22::Waze is the world's fastest-growing community-based traffic and navigation app. Join other drivers in your area who share real-time traffic and road info, saving everyone time and gas money on their daily commute.
Djuki 3::sounds very useful
Aicyla22::exactly
Djuki 3::no need for that, i'm a law abiding citizen, except when i'm speeding
Aicyla22::itll even tell u where cops are posted up
Aicyla22::in addition to that if theres traffic itll re-route you to the fastest possible route taking into account traffic conditions of course.  i used it last time i went to the heat game, it took my to some random route i didnt even know about but it was WAY faster, its amazing
Djuki 3::Alycia, it's on Ocean blvd in Pompano beach
Aicyla22::oh sorry i just saw this yes ocean blvd is a1a which is the road that runs along the beach and pompano is a little north of fort laud but still not too far at all
Aicyla22::googles lying.  its the best app ever... 1 sec
Djuki 3::lol google calls it 91. never heard of it
Aicyla22::oh no i didnt know it was called the 91 we just call it the turnpike and it would most likely be better, actually have u heard of the app waze?
Djuki 3::ronald regan turnpike or florida trnpike, am i way off?
Aicyla22::huh?
Djuki 3::what about 91S
Aicyla22::well now that doesnt take into account traffic which is inevitable on 95 s right at rush hour
Djuki 3::it's cool, ah that's not that bad
Aicyla22::probably a liitle over an hour to get to the AAA
KillaSin515::Well, my work day is over. I will see you guys tomorrow. It was fun dumping on those Heat haters. Be safe guys.
Aicyla22::you too, see ya
TheWalkingDead7::Why is Vince Carter still playing? The man was a good overall player in his prime, with extreme dunking abilities, but thats it. He wasted much of his talent, didn't build himself up as a basketball player, didn't have a good work ethic, and now well past his prime, he expects teams to pay for him to use his former image and brick more than half his shots?
Aicyla22::hes not that bad he just has too big of a role in dallas
Djuki 3::Alycia, are you in Ft Lauderdale?
flexbs::LOL
Aicyla22::yes i am
Aicyla22::k
Djuki 3::ahh i see, i'll find out for sure
Aicyla22::i see fort laud beach isnt that big but a lot of other cities that are not fort laud are called fort laud for sake of simplicity so that might be the case
Djuki 3::lol good question, i'm not sure, haven't been there yet but it's across the street from the beach
Aicyla22::that would be cool the arena's nice, wheres his condo?
Djuki 3::yeah we can go to a Heat game, i've never been to one in Miami
Aicyla22::we should have a heat fan meetup with CB
Djuki 3::yeah but this time it'll be within touching distance ;)
Aicyla22::you arent already doing that? ;)
Djuki 3::my uncle got a condo there recently, i might be coming down within the next 2 months, maybe i can stalk you =P
-Td4mvp3 -::y r u a male predator?
Djuki 3::that's none of your business ;)
-Td4mvp3 -::knicks are gonna get their @$$es handed to them tonight
TheWalkingDead7::Whats up with all these try hards on other teams playing outstanding basketball when they go up against the champs? The other day it was that midget from detroit, then today it was hellmans Mayo, and the entire season up until now its been these worthless teams with talented kids that only want to beat the Heat just to say they did it, because they know they wont see the playoffs or get far in the playoffs for the next 3-4 years
TheWalkingDead7::your just saying that to flatter me.
nhraven52::I liked it
Aicyla22::more power to them i like to see scrubs have a good game
Aicyla22::i didnt like my own comment...
TheWalkingDead7::you liked your own comment, well so will I, nice day to you.
-Td4mvp3 -::anytime the thunder and clips lose and the spurs win and the heat almost lose to a sorry team, its a good night :)
Djuki 3::almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades ;)
-Td4mvp3 -::so let me get this straight...the heat needed overtime to beat dallas and the spurs beat them by 40? man the heat really do suck..hahaha    -spurs nation
flexbs::OKC beat the spurs and the Heat won the championship.. Schooled...   -Heat Nation.
Djuki 3::you do realize Miami plays all of their opponents high on meth and acid to even the playing field right?
TheWalkingDead7::I think its the other way around, opponents are on something crazy good because they seem to play outstanding against just the Heat.
oneandonlybabe::Damn the Spurs are going to murder the Knicks tonight...
oneandonlybabe::Ha @ the twitter feed commenting on what RG3 told Romo... all I can say it's gotta be tough to get commiserating words from a rookie!
Djuki 3::hahha what a troll RGIII is
The Zink::My god, somebody is still paying Vince Carter to clank 65% of his shots?
HeatLaughAtRegularSeason::Can you Feel the Heat?
Djuki 3::not really, i'm in ny brrrrr
01Bulls4life::Why isn't lebron participating in the Dunk contest?  This would give him something more to put on his resume when debating the MJ vs LBJ.  Still, I believe MJ will always be the greatest even though no one can argue that LBJ is the best in this era.
oneandonlybabe::I hope he never enters
The Zink::Real Dunks Happen in Games.  The dunk contest should be run by Cirque de Soleil now, it's so meaningless.
RunTheBall22._::he said he would but he is scared. just the facts don't get to butt hurt people. im out
Djuki 3::my butt is just fine thanks, i work out
Djuki 3::maybe he feels he's past that, too famous to participate in meaningless events
Aicyla22::he said hes too old
Djuki 3::that's true too
01Bulls4life::meaningless?  Then why play at the All star game?
Djuki 3::did you guys know that Jesus is the second coming of Lebron James?
oneandonlybabe::Ok not a heat fan but I gave you one anyway...
Djuki 3::haha thanks ;)
oneandonlybabe::Was MJ the first and is RG3 the third?
Djuki 3::hahaha yeah i wasn't expecting a logistics debate, i just wanted likes from Heat fans =P
oneandonlybabe::LOL  Well I thought Jesus was ageless but I guess this premise is so out there that it shouldn't matter
Djuki 3::Jesus is older too, but that doesn't matter
oneandonlybabe::How can Jordan be the third when he's older?
Djuki 3::well the first coming of LBJ would be LBJ, the 3rd prob Jordan
oneandonlybabe::If Lebron doesn't play against Chicago, they'll lose.
Djuki 3::not if Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr has something to say about that
oneandonlybabe::We'll see. He'll probably play anyway.
HEAT_PLANE_NATION_BABAY13.2::WHEN HEAT NATION SPEAKS DA WORLD LISTENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE WORLDWIDE BABAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Djuki 3::FACT: Since Lebron joined the Heat, he is 100% for finals appearances and 50% finals champ
RunTheBall22._::he was also the number on reason they lost the finals to the Mavs
oneandonlybabe::you obviously don't know me for I don't praise him all the time. I have call him names I won't repeat many times for the nonsense he does at times. Still no matter how ridiculous the Lebron lovers are, the haters are much, much worse. You, for example, cannot help yourself but to talk about him all the time.  You start the topic, not just respond to what someone else says. But as they say there isn't anyone blinder than the person who doesn't want to see.
RunTheBall22._::still in my team? and i don't hate him it's just a game i just don't think he is the all mighty like most people do. and he would not have fit on my team. he was not the guy i wanted. and its people like you you have to praise him all the time that espn should be paying. wake up and see he is not a god, just a ball player and not the best ever.
oneandonlybabe::Dude you just don't get it. I am a fan of Lebron but unless someone else brings up his name I rarely speak about him.  It is the people like you who think (delude themselves)  you hate him who can't stop talking about him. You make him so relevant the NBA and ESPN should send you a check. Deep down inside you wish he was still in your team though for in reality you are just a jilted lover.
Djuki 3::we don't only like his  butt, we like everything on him
RunTheBall22._::lol, you would like to think that everyone does but it's just not the way it is, not everyone is a lebron butt lover.
oneandonlybabe::LMAO... Just admit it you live and breathe Lebron James 24/7 Dude can seriously attract some obsessive behavior
RunTheBall22._::Noah is the center of the nba
oneandonlybabe::Conclusion: win or lose he's the center of the NBA universe and for sure the one and only for RunTheBall, hehe...
RunTheBall22._::so that excuses the fact that he didn't show up?
Djuki 3::also the number one reason they got there
Djuki 3::my maff skills are impeccable
RunTheBall22._::Lebron has a 55 word vocabulary-- FACT
Djuki 3::that's 56 more words than you have
RunTheBall22._::i can spell over 13 words without spell check. lets see lebron do that
RunTheBall22._::not 1, not 2, not 3....oh wait never mind just one
nhraven52::Broken promises :(
Bamm7272::hard to won that many in 2 years...but they are working on it.
HEAT_PLANE_NATION_BABAY13.2::WE GONNA GET 7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DA KING PROMISED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

HEAT_PLANE_NATION_BABAY13.2::THE MOST FRIGHTENING THANG BOUT YA BOY LBJMVP IS HE ONLY 27!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE ONLY GUNNA GET FASTER, STRONGER, TALLER, MEANNER, SMARTER, MADDER, AND FUNNIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  NOW DATS DOIN IT BIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

FSoccer::"You cannot contend with the will of Lebron. There are none who can."  -Saruman
RunTheBall22._::the mavs did and embarrassed him
RunTheBall22._::typical heat fan i see. lol
FSoccer::That event has been erased from history. It never happened
RunTheBall22._::you don 't remember when they punked lebron and won the title or did you just block that out?
FSoccer::32/12/9/3/1  and last I checked, the Mavs lost
HEAT_PLANE_NATION_BABAY13.2::WHO DAT GUNNA BEAT DEM HEAT BOYZ????????????? DA THUNDA?????????? PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DA SPERMS??????????? PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DA HEAT WOULD SWALLOW DA SPERMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nhraven52::Sperms?

Aicyla22::where?
nhraven52::NH
halo_master14@hotmail.com::i'll be back when lebron wins a real championship
KentuckyAlum2012::Why isn't is a real championship? B/c it was in a strike shortened season? I swear haters are so stupid. The Heat played the same number of games as everyone else last season. If the Heat's title isn't a real title then Kobe's points from last season aren't real either and Kobe doesn't have 30K points.
Aicyla22::bye
Djuki 3::see you in JUne

Fanboys Crack Me Up::"All of kobe's stats from last year are obsolete so he really isn't at 30k points yet because last year didn't count"  --Ignorant haters who don't understand that if Lebron's title has an asterisk then so do kobe's stats--
cbbaseball19::Alycia I took your advice, Im going to Cowboys in Davie lol.
