whoaaa::I have to say, Courtney Lee maybe the smallest addition that helps the team the most.  He plays good D, not as good as T. Allen but very good D, and can space the court.  The guy can actually hit 3s.  Marc Gasol and Zbo will actually have room to operate.  To most, this trade was an afterthought, but to those that know the NBA this will help Memphis out greatly.  They will continue their defensive style while adding shooting to the court.
Slobodan::another ridiculous thing, of many, is that mil hired a number of shooters (like mayo and neal) and yet they either do not play or play terribly.  the team seem to regularly shoot around 38% and do not score more than 80 recently.  38%!? 80 points?!  who can you beat with that?
Slobodan::this mil is all over the place.  the coach seems to have no clear idea at all what he wants to achieve and the players must face complete mystery as for who will play and what, and who will sit and why.  i do not see them improving a single bit any time soon.  and they either need to trade some players or kiss goodbye to the coach to get something moving.
Reid L::"Lets start Ridnour and continue on with a rotation based on straw picking" - Larry Drew   This guy is the worst.
Devil's Advocate::There is no way there was 11,379 at the game unless half were invisible.
Rock'Al'Roll::For a team that's looking for the taxpayers to pay for a new arena, 7-31 is not a very convincing argument on the Bucks side.
Trace Mann::Milwaukee is horrible, they are delusional if they think tanking will make them a playoff team next year. this team plays with zero pride and is basically giving the finger to it`s dwindling fan base.
Tony::get henson back in the starting line up coach!
Josh::larry drew is the worst coach in nba history
PKM::Memphis will make the playoffs.
