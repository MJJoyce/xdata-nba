Cool Sun 13::Dragic is playing terrific basketball, this is why Darryl Morey is a complete moron for not trading for Gasol. Lowry is great and all but we needed a legitimate big man like Gasol. We have 2 terrific PGs and we only need to keep 1. Hopefully we can work out another trade for Gasol in the offseason.
sabermetrics are right::Rambis says rockets are rebuilding? They are a playoff team right now I believe. I wish all rebuilding teams could make the playoffs.
5ncounting::chris paul is the most overrated point guard ive ever seen...below .500 since billups went down...what a fraud
boom.shaka.::I think it has more to do with the Clippers' defense - or lack thereof.
Kevin_Loves_Beard::18 points and 8 rebounds for Griffin...Kevin Love puts up double those numbers a game....  LOVE &gt; Blake "Pippy Longstocking" Griffin

Shane33704::good win for the clippers today but they need to man up and stop floping so much
ChuckOlajuwon::Against a  team missing arguably its 2 best players, and 2 players it just traded for.
cadarn1::Really, I'm watching the replay after seeing the game in person.  Over a half dozen obvious fouls so far, very clear on screen, that get absolutely no call.

msuspartsnumberuno::I've bet on sports for a few years with no luck using quite a few different handicappers. Recently I started using a system called Sportsbettingstar. It is a double down type system. The the past 2 months following this system to the exact I have made more profit betting on sports then using my own picks or other cappers. Hope this helps anyone that might be frustrated not winning their bets.
Smile_kkkk::oh shoot wrong board :)
Smile_kkkk::GOOOOOOO Lakers!
msuspartsnumberuno::I found a betting system called Sportsbettingstar a couple of months ago. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I found this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. Its a double down system and is by far the best system I have followed for betting in years of betting on sports. Posting this for anyone that is looking for a legit system to win money on your bets
MonkeyPayne::How can love be number 1 power forward when he has no defense. Even Blake has no defense. Pau can guard the center or power forward positions. Also has good footwork and can shoot with either hand and can pop a three. Would you rather have a skilled 6"9 guy? Or a skilled 7 footer that can also play center for the second unit?
Here_Come_The_NDIrish::how is pau in playoffs
stevenkore::I don't know.  Oh wait, now I remember, he's got TWO rings.
323BrownPride::I wouldn't want GaSoft on my team even if he is 7ft ...
bryan-christopher::Barely 1 1/2 years in the league.. give him more time.. If you remember, Kobe.and Michael Jordon did nothing until their 3rd years.. and Chauncy did nothing for his first 3-4 years...
_tjc44_::Jordan averaged 30 PPG as a rookie.... then scored 63 in his 2nd year....
MonkeyPayne::Dunks is all Blake has.
smr1274@gmail.com::Chauncy, next Clippers coach? good idea?

crawnjc1982::CP3 has to turn it on all QTRS. not just the 4th, he has to understand that its crunch time now and you cant just feel like scoring whenever you want, wtf?
ChuckOlajuwon::Its CP3, he has never done anything more, do not expect more of him now.
CD Dogg::C3PO and Slob City.

Chip_Douglas_69::hate to admit it as a laker fan but getting nick young will help the clips alot. having said that clippers wont beat lal,okc, or sas in the playoffs.
bryan-christopher::we have beaten the Fakers 3 times this season.. The Fakers can not beat the Clippers
ROMEOx24x::lol you mean the 2 pre season games and the 1-1 split in the regular season

elibird123::SPAM
Amaze76er::Blake can become the best P.F in the game some day but for now not even top5
crawnjc1982::what? name your top 5 then
MVP3 Lebron James::Is Fisher havin a hard time leaving Kobe? smh
be_kool16::he's having a hard time playing for houston. they suck
MonkeyPayne::Huh??
Amaze76er::Best poward fowards 1.aldridge 2paul gasol 3.dirk 4love 5bosh
be_kool16::Love is playing the best out of the PF in the league right now. Gasol and Blake put up similar numbers. i think blake puts up more actually.  but personally, i'd still take dirk over everyone in the play offs. then Love.
brown and gold broncos::can't believe you put gasol over dirk and love. that was very uncalled for.
Antonello813::Love is number 1
LebronHasZeroRings::Joke of a list. Alrdirdge is not better than Dirk or Love. Neither is your "Paul" Gasol. It's Pau.   What a joke
igriff1977::gsaol over love. idont think so. the lakers wanted to trade him for love. and Dirk too, thats questionable
MonkeyPayne::The lakers didnt want to trade for love. Minny is the one that wanted Gasol.
MonkeyPayne::Out of all of them pau is the only one that can defend the best.
beachfan12::PF Rankings:  1. Blake 2. KG 3. Dirk 4. Frye 5. LMA
Antonello813::Love is number 1

GoldenGopherfan is done crying over gophers tough OT loss::how can u compare kevin love and dirk?love is the best or 2nd best rebounder in the nba.....
MonkeyPayne::Kevin love had no defense
be_kool16::his defense it probably just the same as dirks. dirk has length but slow. love is more quick. love gets way more rebounds than dirk. but no one can deny dirks clutch offense.
3diego3::Ricky rubio 0r that Kentucky kid? Whats his name? Irving?
3diego3::You right.. But I still like rubio over irving
3diego3::I can argue rondo cant shoot niether... And I think Kemba walker reminds me of wade....
MKG_Floater::Rondo can't shoot, so he isn't a top 3 pg.
MKG_Floater::How does ivring play like a sg? He reminds me of a rookie CP3. So yeah, Irving &gt; Rubio. Rubio has played pro basketball since he was 15 and he still can't shoot.
3diego3::Oh yea I dont like neither so I didnt know but yea why SG? Isnt he a PG?
GoldenGopherfan is done crying over gophers tough OT loss::duke........rubio if you want a PG, irving if you want a SG
3diego3::Blake griffin or alridge?
Antonello813::LOVE!
3diego3::Yeaa Kevin love, kinda reminds you of Dirk .. Hits the three, best player on the court. Good free thrower, and cant defend
3diego3::Oh hecks no! Blake griffin cant hit Free throws, defend, or make a jump shot. Kevin love can and hit the three just as good as the guards in the league
MKG_Floater::Kevin Love is a really, really bad defender. But yeah KLove &gt; BG
3diego3::Not an option but yea Love is better!
GoldenGopherfan is done crying over gophers tough OT loss::i thought you were thinking these 2 were the best PFs....just making sure

Iamtheone0594::Its OK little buddy.  Nobody really expected you to understand.
Oaktown1029::Just watched the highlights - I love the move Paul does when he "boxes out" his defender while he's penetrating into the key - I've never seen anyone do that quite as well as he can!

GoldenGopherfan is done crying over gophers tough OT loss::they see me trollin.......they hatin......
MonkeyPayne::He got drafted in 1984 and won in 1990-1991. If you count 1991 then that just means he won it in 6 years and 6 months. You don't count the 91 idiots.
THE JEFFERNATER::You need to count each season.. Not each calender year. His 7th NBA season he won a title.
Peyton_Manning_In_Red_and_Gold_SUCKITDENVER::its 9 man.
George Uchiha::OMFG!!! ClipsWin1 is GONE!?!?!?!?!?  This is boring... Ill be back @ the next clippers game.  Also, "Peyton_Manning_In_Red_and_Gold_SUCKITDENVER" YOU ARE A TOTAL MORON! FU!
Peyton_Manning_In_Red_and_Gold_SUCKITDENVER::If you are drafted in 84, the season straddles the 84 - 85 season.  If you win in 91, the season straddles the 90-91 season.  Now count with me idiots, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91 = 9 you FING TRADS
MonkeyPayne::Exactly but the 9 is wrong

Anti-Stratfordian::This guy is trollin'.  Stop taking him so seriously.
MonkeyPayne::You don't count 91 bro.
jeterjones05::hey BROSEF!!! yes you do!!!! its the 1990-91 season... he won the ring IN the year 1991!
Birdmann._.::he played 6 FULL seasons before winning.  He was in his 7th season when he won (His full 7th season ended and went to the playoffs in which he won)  <b>He played 7 full seasons before winning</b>
Birdmann._.::yes they are wrong count the seasons yourself  http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html
3diego3::Why are we still talking about Jordan? He's done.. He's retired. and now he owns this sorry ol team thats best player is a rookie! If anything we should talk about the way is running his team not when he won his first ring.
Birdmann._.::<b>Jordan won in his 7th season. FACT</b>  http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html
