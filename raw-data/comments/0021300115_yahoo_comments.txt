gary::The Wolves are looking good and the Cavs are oh well just as expected.
You Don'T Know, Bo Knows::Another GREAT win for the Wolves.  It was like poetry in motion tonight.  Good to see the team respond with Kevin Martin out for the game.  Go Wolves.
Cyril::Why is everyone bagging on Thompson? He has been the only player on this team playing with any intensity this year, and even tonight he managed 10 points and 6 boards in 23 minutes.  What I saw out of this Cleveland team tonight was a lack of effort and heart from nearly every main rotation player.  Even Anderson Varejao, who is usually one of the most relentless players in the game, seemed like he didn't want to be out there. There was very little chemistry between the guards, and it's time to admit that Dion Waiters is not the sidekick that everyone hoped he would be for Irving.  I still have hopes for Irving, but he's got to learn how to get everyone else involved.
doug::I am impressed with Bennett's 4.8% shooting percentage.
Yao::Ohhhhhhh my Cavs … 0-6 on the road. 6 out of 9 games on the road to start the season isn't nice, but, you gotta do better than this!! No one is performing. You can't expect Anthony Bennet to be any good if the other players aren't making the game easier for him. Too much pressure on the young dude right from the top. TERRIBLE!!
Dixon Cider::It's terrible that Anthony Bennett actually improved his FG% on the year by going 3-11 LOL
Alfren::Rubio is beasting! 16pts and 16asts
Lomar::i can smell getting a double-double here! way the go ricky rubio!
J.Singh::Like if you think Mike Brown is going to be the first NBA coach fired this year!!!
PKM::Probably a blow out loss by the Cavs, again.
