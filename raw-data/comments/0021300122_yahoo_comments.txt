Steven McCormick::Too bad Ibaka was ejected  . . . . I think that might have been the tipping point.   Do you think Barnes might have purposely started that fight just so he and Serge could get ejected . . . . or could it SAATTAAANNN!!!
PKM::Barnes attacks Ibaka and they both get ejected.  Great strategy by Barnes.  Do the refs know he tries to fight everyone?
Epidemic::I wanna see the day where Westbrook and Durant actually use their skills as defensive threats.  Westbrook has the ability to lock guys down, but he would rather ride his youth and athleticism into being a scoring threat.
bluuzman::I see the NBA's Golden Boy is well on his way to another 20 ft attempt game.
CPO. Corey Davis::kevin durant averages 17 FT's a game someone explain how that is even possibly, i understand fouling but does he get fouled on all his drives.
Ddog::The Thunder has dominated the Clippers over the years winning at a rate of 78%. This includes a 3 game sweep last season. But when it comes to road games, that drops to 51%. This game should be a good measuring stick for the Clippers to see how they rank against elite teams.
kgdkdsk jgrjfgjd;fl::I think there was a UFO sighting at the game tonight. Westbrick (PG) actually passed the ball.
John::The favoritism of the Heat, OKC and the Lakers make the NBA really a joke.   The NBA refs and the announcers love affair with these teams is so old.  LBJ is allowed to travel 8 times a game and foul folks without getting calls, OKC gets free calls after free calls, and Kobe whines up and down the floor till he gets calls. LBJ also whines up and down the floor, flops all the time (so does Wade)...
Pete::Barns and Ibaka out? advantage Clippers.
Commenter::I dont think barnes did enough the get ejected.a foul but not ejection
