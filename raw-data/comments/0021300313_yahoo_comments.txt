I State Facts And You Get Mad::KD is by far the most overrated scorer in the game... Half of his points every game come from the FT line
CSONKA_39::What's up with Teague? Is he nursing an injury?
PKM::This should be a good game.  Durant is fun to watch.
Guest::It has been nice to see Westbrick with 2 assist double doubles in a row. They play much better when he moves the ball around more. Keep it up Russell, this is how you should be doing every game!!!
fup duck::I'm a die-hard Laker fan and Fish is my man, but I don't get why he's getting a run with Okla, he's really not contributing much for someone getting so many minutes
Jabari::The OKC Thunder have won!
KEITH::Hawks goin nowhere just like the Falcons.
roe::The Hawks are good but man they won't be able to stop Durant & Westbrook thats a deadly combo
Junior Bravo::most people like okc for next year championship finals
Jabari::Anyone else think that this score is just too close?
