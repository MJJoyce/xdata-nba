Darrell::0 zero points for jimmer and a +/- -8. Just get rid of this clown already.
MiamiRomeo::Well the Heat didn't look that engaged in the first quarter whatsoever but they quickly turned that around. GO HEAT!!!
PWeis909::Good to see so many Heat players contribute.
Professor::As an analyst, I see the problem with SAC,  McLemore and Thomas continue to get beat on the defensive end.
Devon::James, Wade, and Bash lets go, Miami we can do it.
I State Facts And You Get Mad::I would not be surprised if Beasley is back for this game... It seems like Spo doesnt want the Pacers to see what the Heat look like when he plays against them
Rocka fella::Shuttlesworth dunking , Wade hitting threes--they should beat Indiana more often....
Yeti on the Loose::Cousins amazing, but he can't do it himself
David::Rudy G reportedly wants OUT of Sac. Hes already tired of LOSING and is p,,,,,,,ed off at over being banished to "Here we SUCK!!!!!"
heinzy k::The refs love the Heat so much that they gave the Kings the FT advantage
