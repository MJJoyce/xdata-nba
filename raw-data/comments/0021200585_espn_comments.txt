dwade grater den jordan 5.0::iggy sux so bad dis year are u fans glad u traded him 2 nugs?
clipctb::Two things would help the 76ers.  A big body in the paint; I think Blair would be great fit.  Also recognition that Evan Turner is the 2nd best PG on the team and let Turner run the PG when Holiday is not in the game.  turner running the point forces him touse all his skills , be more aggressive, and creates big mismatches for the sixes!
Brian Murphy 1995::Wait till we get a center--Go Sixers !
allcitypics::Jrue tied for third in the league in assists and 12th in scoring. Should make All-Star team.
TheBrownestBob::If Deron Williams or Joe Johnson makes the All-Star team over Jrue Holiday, I will literally vomit in my cereal.
Ivanov21::don't worry they won't.. but it's going to be very close between Holiday and Irving imo
CoreyGallagherArt::That All Star, Jrue Holiday
NBARefereeSucks::...
NBARefereeSucks::How can Raptors win a ball game if they are also fighting against 3 more people inside the court!... I am so used of Raptors losing but c'mon Refs open your eyes even just the final minute of the ballgame and make the right call!
Mumu8833::Didn't the refs give the Raptors a late 4th qt 3 that was after the shot clock?  Refs were letting so much go on both sides of the ball.
don garrow::There is to much inconsistency regarding who plays when and why. I have seen most of the games this season and but when Calderon plays point guard there appears to be a more involvement of all players on the floor. Not to take away Lowry heroics or shooting ability but he has a tendency to want the ball in his hands and believes "I can win this game just watch me."  In other words, regardless of the abilities of the other four players on the floor, they are not to be trusted with the ball. I don't know what the team record is when Lowry has more minutes than Calderon but I would be willing to bet the Raptors have a more consistent winning percentage when Calderon has the ball handler then when Lowry is given the same responsibility. Also the more athletic players, such as DeRozan, Davis,  Ross and perhaps Fields along with Johnson should be given more playing time during the more critical periods of a close game, with Calderon bringing the ball up the floor. Calderon has a better sense of where all the players are, more so then Lowry and is perhaps a more reliable shooter in a close game. Lowry, as good as he is does not have the court generalship as Calderon, Lowry is too erratic and Calderon is not. When the other players return from their injuries, especially Bargnani, he has to change his method of play and be more of power forward and blend in with the rest of the team, off the bench, where he can be more effective. Casey has to light a fire on all players on the floor to ensure they do not lose big leads. Get mad, do not be afraid of what you will look like on TV, kick $@%!  He has a very, very athletic and young team and they will respect him more because of his anger on the sidelines. The refs will see it.  Eventually the close calls will come his way.  No one should blame the refs, when they lose a 20 point lead!
cjax34::You should go to the Rapters blog on the score; better conversation on there then in here; where it's mostly trolls
HotdogSalesman2012::jrue's on the allstar team right??
EoaRider::Dwayne Casey needs to kick the THE FKIN SH IT out of a ref so they will respect the raps for once they have cost as 4 or 5 games already this season
patsmayo1::yep... throw an incidental elbow to the face...
patsmayo1::im going to say chances are 60/40 they do
patsmayo1::Not to keep harping on old news, it is what it is, raps got screwed by the refs, but also blew another huge lead. But what are the chances, the league issues a 3rd apology to the raptors?? lol
rsilver14::dont blame the refs. blame the 19 point lead that was blown.
celebrate good times come on::yea and philly is so much better right now
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Toronto is a bad team...and the refs make them worse. If Toronto was half way decent, games wouldn't be this close. And if the officiating was half way decent Toronto would be up 5+ wins this season.
fried blowney::Guy gets pushed out of bounds, no foul, other team gets the ball and ties the game.  I'm sorry, but Toronto got screwed on this one (even if they did blow it).
Mumu8833::yea, but the raptors got a 3 in the 4th that was after the shot clock...
patsmayo1::he's right guys
Rob Riggle FTW::wright only 5 min? why?
Classics1010::Jrue Holiday deserves to make the All-Star team...Hope he gets it
patsmayo1::agreed, jrue is an amazing talent.. he is the best PG in the east right now, imagine if he played on the spurs, clippers, heat??? wowww
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::yep
17850Tommy::The NBA is a popularity contest..not only should jrue be in the ASG he should be starting
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::no kidding. rondo and KG starting is a joke
EoaRider::Rondo leads the league in assist and is much better than Holiday , Garnett sucks tho
Romney47percent::You just wait til we get our ape back !! you know that guy we got from the Lakers the guy who always eats watermelon in between quarters and goes out with the boys after  the game to KFC and orders 2 buckets of KFC fried chicken !! yeah that guy  will make us win.. LMAO   ~ 76 ers Fan
Sh4k4zulu::Can't be offended when we won free big Mac sorry dude
Igglesnation::how much money did you lose tonight?
Igglesnation::Feels good to win for once
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::Nice!!!! Dam.n these wins are hard to come by.

koke003::Lol Fly
FlyGuys623::imma check out how it is
patsmayo1::i wouldve won 700$ lol.. thanks refs
patsmayo1::I had a 6 game parlay went 4/4 had raptors and celtics, both just got screwed by the refs to bring it into overtime, im speechless lol
patsmayo1::lol correct and correct
dm24::dont bet on the raps, the refs do not like toronto
FlyGuys623::dont bet
dm24::the raptors should be deeply ashamed of themselves for doing this nonsense again of having a nice lead then blowing the game, all you can say to the useless players is see ya!!,  lets go blue jays
just2940::It's not their fault, really. They tried. No one is clutch, too much inconsistency. I mean, look at our roster.
Tommy72931::Yeah.  It's not like the Lakers who have 4 hall of famers on their starting five and still can't get to .500.  This Raptors team honestly and genuinely stinks.  There are no top 50 players (in a 30 team league) on the Raptors.
bluedevils1148::JRUE.
koke003::Lol C's
FlyGuys623::koke, im worried to see how the celts fans are reacting right now lol
FlyGuys623::hes a cool dude but i wouldnt be surprised
IggyIsClutch::Uk might be going nuts
Tommy72931::Well GG sixers fans.  You kept it classy and it's always gratifying to come back from a huge deficit to win in the dying seconds/ot...  I really thought you were dead after Ross started hitting but Casey froze him out on the bench....
potato623::Hockey tomorrow!!!!!!!
CoachHouser::I'm not watching/attending/don't care.  Then in two weeks, I'll be over it.   :(
erinbaby1997::Yawn again, fans should boycott the greed and short season!
IggyIsClutch::Yeah it shouldn't have gone to ot but I'm glad it did. At least you kept it classy unlike some other people on here
potato623::Great game, sorry it didn't go your way but we really need that bad
FlyGuys623::yep he was automatic
FlyGuys623::nice shot hinrich. ot for the celts game
DeNiro894::lol at the celtics
Romney47percent::funny thing is all these idiotic 76 ers fans are all up and arms about a team who is 7 games under 500 and won't make the playoff ?? Hahaha bunch of tools LMAO
potato623::Up in arms? Not really, just excited it was a fun game
PhilliesFlyersEagles::But I'll stand by the team either way
just2940::What fan shouldn;t be happy when they win ?
FlyGuys623::6 btw
FlyGuys623::nice math
PhilliesFlyersEagles::Who is saying that? We suck.
IggyIsClutch::Someones upset
erinbaby1997::Nice job refs, sixers got 2nd chance
IggyIsClutch::33 points 14 assists 5 rebounds 3 steals If those aren't all star stats then I don't know what is
Romney47percent::Go blow him already you muppet!!
IggyIsClutch::Lol butt hurt
erinbaby1997::Yawn
just2940::GG Philly, but how many times will the 'Raps get burned by the refs. This is actually getting laughable.
bluedevils1148::You can't say it was the refs, because you had a 17 point lead that was blown. I feel your pain though. Whenever we face Boston this happens every five seconds.
just2940::Yea, you guys deserved the W. We blew it for sure. As a fan, it's just frustrating.
TryHardSlime::Jrue needs to be an All Star
ignasm::Raps season is cooked, they had a chance here the last couple of weeks, but key games, winnable games have been lost, now there is a tough stretch ahead with nothing to show for....
Sam Stone59::Thanks Philly, (time in a half for overtime) Really?  Overtime to beat the Raptures ...
PhilliesFlyersEagles::You could say the same thing about us had Toronto won...
potato623::We suck dude, what do you expect
crnyrbn::the raptors have the WORST coaching staff in the NBA
PhilliesFlyersEagles::Jrue=BEAST
Colin___444::people are forgetting this was legitimately the refs fault. shouldn't have had OT
FlyGuys623::you cant look forward to falling back on blaming the refs. once in overtime, its a new game
potato623::I'll take it right now
toronto-vigilante3::How can you not call a blatant push into the back out of bounds on an inbound pass?
toronto-vigilante3::Like, I can understand if it was a big market champion team contender that got that call....But the SIXERS???   The league really wants to keep the Raptors down in the garbage standings.
wilcox1232::the nba will just make another apology liek the bulls and bobcats games
FlyGuys623::a damn shame if holiday doesnt make the allstar team
potato623::He better make it, he's top 5 in the league right now
FlyGuys623::yep
potato623::Top 5 PG, not player
Romney47percent::Lol who would be stupid enough to bet on a team from Canada ?
koke003::BIG MACSSSSSSS
binskikevin::OH SAYY CAN YOU SEEE BY THE DAWNS EARLY LIGHT
binskikevin::I DONT KNOW THE REST, SORRY. LEMME GOOGLE IT REAL QUICK
DeNiro894::where would the sixers be without Holiday
Tommy72931::pretty much like the wizards without wall
potato623::Hell
nyknicksrnumber1::the raptors do not have a coach that is the problem
Colin___444::casey is a great coach, their defense improved vastly when he got here
wilcox1232::and then deproved back to worse than ever
IggyIsClutch::Gg Lets go flyers
FlyGuys623::MHMM CANT WAIT! GIROUXXXXXXXXXX
