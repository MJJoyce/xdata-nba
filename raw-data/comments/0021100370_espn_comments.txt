Crobby22::Milwaukee still has a team?  Thats a shame for the people of Milwaukee.
marcpru60::for a while there looked like bucks, nuggets and pacers to be interesting no star teams to watch... lose to suns at home?  down to two
Pan6502::Despite his age,Steve Nash is a beast.Wish he had better teamates.
CandySparker::Hola Lotta Love! Close be still Nash and young.
darrell1292::once again, as usual, the worthless,  dumb a s s ,  legally blind in both eyes, old fart ref's strike again .   friggiingg joke.    the suns get screwed by these idiots every damn night !      8  free throws the whole game.  b u l l s h i t  !     and last night it was only  7 free throws  !!!  to h e l l  with the stupid nba and the minimum age 96 yr old refs.
panther4406::Drew Gooden trying to prove he's actually worth the money spent on him.  Nice to see.
TheLuckyG85::Adios Jennings All Star bid
Ghost8210::Suns headed to the playoffs!  At least I hope, Steve Nash deserves better than to miss the playoffs to end his career (which could be this year).

brettszebraboyz::Thunder Up!
EvolutionaryMokeski::It's stunning that a team whose coach can't figure out who to give consistent minutes to is producing inconsistent results. I guarantee if Andrew Bogut were back in the lineup for the next game Gooden would play less than 20 minutes despite scoring over 16 points in six of the last seven games. Nobody knows their role. Teams don't win consistently that way.

Gt_jackets89::I'm out, have fun with the high school-like debates, it was entertaining
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::YES! Three wins in a row! Happy Birthday Steve! The birthday boy scores the GW basket. Awesome! Looking forward to watching the Suns beat the Rockets on Thursday night! Go Suns!
I know things many do not::Woohoo Arizona sports. :)
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Can't Wait!
masgtp::how does someone only get 3 points in 28 min of work, especially with talent like jennings...
cbcash4678::It wasn't about struggling last night....he went soft on them.  No idea why....Skiles getting on his nerves, GF probs?  But he didn't once dribble the ball into the lane...and going against Nash (let's face it, he's a bad defender).....not sure what the hell that was but it wasn't BJ, at least as a Bucks fan, I hope not :(
masgtp::im from chicago, so im a bulls fan ofc, but i am a huge brandon jennings fan. hes on my fantasy team, wondering if i should trade him with his value pretty high still from his huge streak of 20-25+ games
CheeseheadNation2011::No dont trade him keep him hes strugling a bit for know but he will be fine
Gt_jackets89::They play for scott skiles
CornhuskerKid02::Has to be something wrong with him, took only 4 shots and hasn't played well over the last week or so
buckspackers23::I liked the fight back by the Bucks tonight, however, what was that last play suppose to be? Jennings was open, Ilyasova had a decent look, and Dunleavy is always a good target. Ersan doesn't know what to do in pressure situations.
Gt_jackets89::Off topic, how do you say $@%! without censor?
buckspackers23::Shit or fuck?
macbeth5518::Scott Walker or Jan Brewer
jjota80::Rick Renzi
buckspackers23::Scott Walker is jesus.
masgtp::pronounced "Hey-Zoose"

KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Thats how it should me?  ___________________  What does that mean?   Lol
Gt_jackets89::No thanks I think I'm fine with my money
brehmevan::Why are we acting like this was the dam.n Super Bowl? Guys, it's a NBA game between two sub-.500 teams who aren't going anywhere. We need to take it easy!

KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::I know... I was giving him a hard time.
Gt_jackets89::High schools biggest waste of time, I'm glad i'm done
www.pornhub.com::You Buck fans have to admit it though...Milwaukee is depressing as hell!! It isn't crap to do up there!!
jjota80::"It isn't crap to do up there"  There must be so much to do in Arizona that you never learned grammar. I'd rater be depressed and informed than entertained and ignorant.  Oh and by the way - Milwaukee is home to the biggest music festival in the world. Educate yourself fool.
alstottnation::Does making cheese count as "fun"?
Gt_jackets89::All about livin in the moment
Gt_jackets89::Ever heard of making your own fun?
Gt_jackets89::Haha thats true, your username always brings a bit of fun

Orange602::God damn snow birds
www.pornhub.com::Yo ASU parties are wild as f*ck!! So you can't hate on ASU!! I wish I went their instead of Texas A&amp;M...
pvmountaineer::UW Madison is a party school and also has much higher academic standards than ASU
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::ASU is a better party school, and has the best looking girls.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::ASU is awesome!

alstottnation::Can't beat the mixed smell of cheese and cows.
Gt_jackets89::I honestly don't have that strong of a preference of AZ or WI, I just happen to go to college in Madison. I'm actually from ATL.
dcenate2012::I plan on going to Eau Claire in two years
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::You should, AZ has beautiful women and weather.
Gt_jackets89::Plus most WI residents are legal
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::No people in AZ are more down to earth.
Gt_jackets89::WI has good education, people, and kick $@% sports teams
arizonasting001::Being overweight is like having a permanent STD. You proud of that, Milwaukee?
jjota80::Meh, Milwaukee is in the middle of the pack. Educate yourself Arizona.
Pujols sold out.::Wisconsin isn't an obese state in comparison to most southern states... and probably western states too.
jjota80::It's true. Southern states dominate the weight by way of that good ol' soul food. But chances are facts probably don't have of role in your opinion so that won't much matter to you.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Lol
pvmountaineer::Only you can lose the weight, and it isn't contagious.
Gt_jackets89::Very
dcenate2012::I am proud of my abs and playing football yes.
