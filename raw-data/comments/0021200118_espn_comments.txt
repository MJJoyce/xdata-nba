pantherz515::either Damian Lilliard, Harrison Barnes , or MKG will win rookie of the year
1337s0lja::Please get RID of Josh Smith Danny Ferry!!!
ISTIK2DaGCODE::Klay Thompson has a per of 0 it says lmao
azwildcat6867::Been betting with an online system called Sportsbettingstar for a few months. I have made over $3,000 a month now for three straight months since I started following it. This system was on the very first page of Google when I searched terms like Baseball Betting System or Sports Betting System. It is extremely popular and if you have not heard of this system I highly recommend it
NBARefsRimRose::pfft! you know you're sh*t if you need  'system' website software.. i'm pro.. i don't need others to give me advice.. or gimmick. get lost loser!
BayAreaSportsFan16::Harrison Barnes should win ROY however the warriors never get respect so he won't
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::Rookie of the Year award is based on the whole season NOT one game
B lil::Harrison Barnes ROY!
BayAreaSportsFan16::i liked his status
Dontunderstandpositions::Who is the center for the Golden State Warriors
derek_510::lmao, i just read your username.
Dontunderstandpositions::Why was Blake Griffin a power forward being covered by Shane battier a small forward this is like any sense
derek_510::because battier is a good defender, he's been known to play the 4 with lebron on the floor.  you have very little knowledge of todays basketball world.
Dontunderstandpositions::You know where I can find out who's covering who on game day
Pr0ject_sky::Normally Bogut hes been shut down to strengthen his ankle. Fetus Ezlie is starting atm.
Dontunderstandpositions::Nobody ever answers any my questions are you people real
Dontunderstandpositions::Anybody know where I could find out what position is covering what position like for instance the Lakers are playing the spurs who's covering Tony Parker tonight is another point guard or somebody else
Dontunderstandpositions::First of all with the center being out how come the back of center didn't get any points
Dontunderstandpositions::I appreciate your reply see you just think it's as bad coaching also have a quick question do you know where I could find out which players is covering which players on game day
Pr0ject_sky::no
Pr0ject_sky::He got 2 the question really is why did he only play in the teens in minutes. Mjackson is way over his head. Hes lucky ATL didnt just pound the ball in the paint like the lakers did.
Pr0ject_sky::God people who bet on sports and lose then claim the sport is rigged and continue to bet have to be the most miserable people in America. You people really need to get help.
ATLANTA BRAVES TOMAHAWK CHOP::no horford or devin harris....we almost pulled it out....good try hawks.
1337s0lja::As long as we have Josh Smith and his 4 for 15 free throws. Also his 23% shooting from outside and his lack of scoring in the paint now a days the Hawks are in for a long season. Get RID of Josh Smith, he should have went to College and learned something called discipline.
Pr0ject_sky::No Bogut for the Warriors so injuries cancel each other out.
ATLANTA BRAVES TOMAHAWK CHOP::um no Bogut has done nothing for the Warriors while Horford is a vital part of the Hawks.
MetsoooNLoooChampsooo2012::i must have lost 1300 in the last 2 weeks and each game right down to the wire... $@%!$@% cornell fouls with .6  left to make me lose by half a point and now this
Pr0ject_sky::hookers =/= models. Only fake a** chumps need to pay to get laid. loser.
NBARefsRimRose::Pr0ject_sky - hookers =/= models. Only fake a** chumps need to pay to get laid. loser.  only a dumbarse is idiot enough to tie themselves down to 1 $@%!$ and get whipped! lol while you're stuck on one loose cookie all day i've got plenty of fresh ones week in week out! who's the chump now?

NBARefsRimRose::Condo Snap - you sound like a bigger loser you have no secrets... you will break even, more likely a little under when all is said and done.  LOL! mate i make a living off chumps on betfair.. i get $1000 hookers week in week out to suck my balls and lik my ar $e! you can only dream the models i get with!
Condo Snap::you sound like a bigger loser you have no secrets... you will break even, more likely a little under when all is said and done.

xgamesfan81::What betting site do you use
xgamesfan81::Was it a 3 game parlay?
xgamesfan81::Won a grand on this game, never betting on gs again thoa.
WarriorsWarrior::I'm convinced the warriors have the worst team doctors? Bogut is a disappointment!   Good win though!
Pr0ject_sky::I would  rather have injured bogut on this team then a healthy monte. Plus if there was no questions about bogut no way the bucks trade him. If he gets healthy Ws easily make playoffs.
ATLANTA BRAVES TOMAHAWK CHOP::Bogut has been injury prone his whole career.
marat 2.0::Biedrins is +11. Now that's funny!
SB4LlFE::lol was about to post about it... that's the highest on team too
MetsoooNLoooChampsooo2012::wanna know what the outcome of the game will be? check to see which team has more gamblers with money on them and the other will certainly win
xgamesfan81::So true for Miami vs clippers. Easily 60% of people went with miami
nate.farey::I did
stat3250::Which deal should I do or should I just stay pat?   Trade 1: I get: Kyrie Irving and Marcin Gortat. I give up: Lebron James and drop Seraphin  Trade 2: I get: Kyrie Irving, Marcin Gortat and Glen Davis. I give up: Lebron James and Javale Mcgee  (Drop candidates: Jason Thompson, Kevin Seraphin and Andre Drummond)

SB4LlFE::barnes is clutch
masterp0703::I'm pretty sure he made more clutch game winning shots his freshman year at UNC than any other player in their entire UNC career.
fredsnotdeadyet::Being a UNC fan I told people last game coach should have played Barnes because he comes up when he is needed. He is very clutch and glad to see him get some great minutes this game and see what he can do with the minutes, a BEAST
WarriorsWarrior::I agree  - Klay
bbkdta::MAN YOU GOT TO REBOUND THAT TO COVER THE LINE..
SB4LlFE::gotta start making FT's!!!
