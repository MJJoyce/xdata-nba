Rachel Sims::Ya They are doing great  BUT Its counter productive,  Fact is we still need another dynamic player to have a chance in playoffs.  If we draft 7th instead of 2nd   WE DONT GET A DYNAMIC PLAYER PERIOD.   BECAUSE WE SURE AS HELL CANT GET A FREE AGENT.   AND DONT POINT AT LEBRON HES JUST TEASING US RIGHT NOW.  HE AINT COMING HERE.  Speights can win you a few games against an 11 - 13 team, but he can't put the team on his back and GO Yard against a Playoff team forget it.  thats why we need that 2nd overall pick. .
agent_three_oh::Can't argue about Speights, but he could be a beast with the second team. The "draft 7th instead of 2nd" conversations get kinda old though. Some fans sound like they think that the team should strategically lose games to maintain a draft position. Nothing wrong with a young team learning to win. They're gonna have to do it sooner or later. right?
gplace57::Warrick only one of two players with a (+ rating), yet he sits the bench.   At some point, the coach needs to go and give some other players (Warrick) more time.
coltranesteelkirt::Cavs are the hottest team in the league right now. I'd pick them in any possible matchup.
vh7510::Speights was a steal in that trade.
1mproperDancing::They literally got him for free.  Actually, Memphis paid Cleveland to take him.
tennisfanatic0123::its alright bobcats fan you will have a better season than last season.  just wait one more year and you can potentially land Jabari Parker
Theironrod2012::cavs &gt; lebron
gocleveland07::LETS GO CAVS!!! GO CLEVELAND!!!
Kyrie_Irving_Is_The_Man::Cavs playing good ball but they're still 10 games out of the playoffs and the Celtics have just won 5 in a row. I would love to see the Cavs make a push, but I don't think it's possible anymore. Oh well. As long as the Lakers keep winning and make the playoffs, the cavs will have 2 top 16 picks in the draft. Go Cavs!
sugarglyder::The Cavs don't have a playoffs ready roster, so they're better off in the lottery.  Remember, most of the roster is still designed around tanking.
quickbr0wnf0x::I disagree.   It is not designed around tanking, it is designed around young players growing, improving, and getting more consistent.  If they win, that is optimal, but in any case they should be building for the future.
Ontario925::This is the best the Cavaliers have played since LJ left. That big trade with the Grizzlies is paying off turning them around from being doormats to big contendors quickly.
sugarglyder::lol The Cavs aren't contenders.  They're taking baby steps from doormats to being fairly competitive.
quickbr0wnf0x::And LA is almost up to a 50-50 chance at the playoffs.   Cavs fans hope the Lakers make it, so that Cleveland can get a better draft pick.
quickbr0wnf0x::Hmm, they were below 1% before, so their odds are improving!
sugarglyder::gocleveland07 - only ten games out of the 8th seed. anything is possible in any type of situation -------------------------------------------  Not really.  1.1% playoff odds:  http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/playoffodds
gocleveland07::only ten games out of the 8th seed. anything is possible in any type of situation

You can find this system on the 1st page of Google if you search the term Sports Betting Systems.
JohnsonnnL::Glad TT is proving all the doubters wrong.
EKast2012::Toronto's finest
Banned in C-Town::He is sure as hell proving me wrong, if he can show the same improvement from this year to next... Wow
navyctr312::Looks like James n Noel in 2014 are gonna bring the end of the world in Cleveland with this squad!
sugarglyder::Uh, how are you planning on drafting Noel when the Cavs will likely finish in the 8-10 lottery slot?  You're not being realistic at all.
quickbr0wnf0x::They're going to win the lottery, naturally!
EKast2012::And Varejao (if he can stay healthy)
HunterF4444::Great win
TSlakersmvp::Kobe Bryant Lil wayne
YogaBeer::Remembering when fans of other teams told us Cav fans would stop going to the Q.    Very telling when you look at the schedule for most Cavalier games, there aren't many tickets available unless you go to stubhub.   e.g.  tickets that have already sold.   OR if there are available at the most in the low hundreds.  Away games?    Thousands available at almost every arena.  Cavalier fans are loyal!
TSlakersmvp::Dion Waiters is gonna be a stup straiddup and tkaeover the team frm irving
YogaBeer::Don't know about taking over, but rather a complement.    With him driving to the basket now, he's starting to figure it out.   I think, believe it or not, CJ Miles as helped a ton in that  area.  Both are now getting to the line a ton and is one reason we're winning now.    Cavaliers have the top FT in the NBA at the moment.     shooting shots that are well over 80% are better odds than shooting for around 40%.
quickbr0wnf0x::That was always a big concern.   When you shoot 60% at the line, then lose by 2-3 points, that pretty much decided the game.
YogaBeer::oh good Lord!    I should've prefaced the FT% with recently!!!   The Cavaliers prior to were one of the worst, but recently have improved so much, they are at the top in THAT time span.    sorry for any confusion there.
Sleo810::Great win...... We still need a proven PF that can get us 20 &amp; 10 every night, we need to trade our number 1 this year... Call blazers (LAmarcus) hawks (josh smith) jazz (Jefferson) or T-wolves (Derrick Williams) don't give up our number 1 for Williams tho....
Sleo810::Zeller will back up oden..
MsWhit09::There is no reason to rush to be a middle of the pack team, get 4 top 5 picks all under 22 in your starting line up, let them grow together and then continue to build a good bench. You may be the 8 seed next year instead of the 4th or 5th but you could be the 1 seed in 2-3 years like the Thunder. Stick to the plan Dan.
OHDAWG13::The other question is center.  Can Zeller develop into a full time Andy?  Sure hope so, because let's face it, Andy's value is a big ? right now.
quickbr0wnf0x::Zeller could develop into a legit starter, but more likely he will become a good rotation player, taking advantage of playing against the opponent's second team.
YogaBeer::Zeller will need to gain some muscle to get the kind of "Andy Game".   Hard to tell in Tyler's situation, but you gotta love the improvement in his overall game.   He's starting to figure out his footwork, positioning (both O and D).    He simply lacks strength underneath the bucket at this point.
OHDAWG13::Biggest need is a SF who can shoot 3s.  Doesn't have to be a big scorer, just an equalizer to spread out the floor.  Gee is athletic but lacks the 3.  Walton is a classic "role" player but gets lost.  Casspi has just fallen off the face of the earth.
Sleo810::Lol....good points..... But I don't think we need to keep our number 1 this year.... If u look at the cavs ages most all is at 25 or younger.... Only verajo is 30.... Even once we get oden he's only 25....
YogaBeer::I agree.    The Cavaliers, depending on a couple of teams and where they end up, could possibly have 6 picks this year and all of them in the top 40.    Certainly a team that is ready to rebuild could make a BIG splash with these picks.  The team needs experience.    So if we can get THAT player, a Josh Smith, Kevin Love or even a Rudy Gay, this team could very well contend for a middle of the road PO team next season.     Maybe we could entice a team looking to rebuild to take a few of these picks off our backs.  However, I realize most fans are calling this a weak draft, remember they said that in Irving and TT's class and that draft class has put out a lot of very good rotational type players.   I'd like to at least pick one or two guys this season.  I'd go for a SF project like that kid from Ohio State and a back-up PG like the kid from Ohio U (DJ Cooper).
YogaBeer::Triston Thompson is the PF you're looking for.   He's a double double machine.    SF is the need.
quickbr0wnf0x::Look at his assist numbers when he plays significant minutes...
YogaBeer::For speed yes, but for actual purpose, no.    Luke at least has an incredible knack for being where the action is.    I've been very hard on Luke since we got him, but dang if the guy doesn't know spacing, how to clog the lane, etc.    Slow but purposeful.
HunterF4444::I'd probably trade Luke for him haha
YogaBeer::oh... and Derrick Williams is a waste.    I wouldn't trade Luke Walton for him.
TSlakersmvp::Dion Waiters Keep Ballin
carp2368::wonder how many more wins we'd have if we had speights and Ellington all year
OHDAWG13::Sounds great, would love to see Oden here, but I'm not counting on it.  Call me pessimistic ...
quickbr0wnf0x::Even if he does come, how much will he be able to play?   That is something no one can predict.
YogaBeer::Oh I'm not counting on that either.    Just a good story if it did happen.
Sleo810::&amp; a healthy Greg oden!
YogaBeer::That would be great for the Cavs and Oden.    Wouldn't that be something?    Sort of like a resurrection story along the lines of Big Z.    wondering if that's what the FO have in mind?    Oden could stand to learn a ton from Z who went through something very similar in his career.
YogaBeer::I'm thinking the only thing the Cavaliers need now is experience.
HunterF4444::This should be good for a laugh: In 24 minutes tonight, Ryan Hollins had 13 pts and 8 rebounds for the Clippers.
steve mctowelie::check him for deer antler spray
YogaBeer::Magic
yata-9arasu::...................................  I think I just died a little inside.....  Wow.
CleveHeelFan::im going to the cavs game saturday vs the nuggets
nargash::I don't like the 24 3's we took. I am not a big fan of relying on 3 pointers...!!
CKJPVBC::Cavs didn't rely on 3 pointers to win this game at all. Half of those three pointers came during garbage time, which was essentially the whole fourth quarter.
ctown8686::I'm a 3 pointer fan, as long as you make em
Wesley-Mike2012::Unfortunately, that has been one of our two achilles heels for this season for the Bobcats.  We can't defend the 3 and people score in bunches in the paint.  So it's to a team advantage to shoot 3's against us.
ClevelandBoy4321::I Told you yoga it was gonna be a cavs win!
YogaBeer::Good carry over from the Thunder game.     Cavaliers seem to be growing up instead of letting up.
YogaBeer::5 for 5  -  Kyrie Irving
nargash::I am ok with Kyrie but the rest need to attack the basket more. CJ Miles need to cut his 3's..!!
browns fan 97::good win by the cavs great team game tonight keep it up #GOCAVS
YogaBeer::Even the Cavalier girls looked great tonight.
randumo24::Lol, they were 11-36 coming in. When your record is that bad, there is no such thing as a trap game.
ClevelandBoy4321::You see Yoga I told you it was gonna be an absolute cavaliers win! HaHa! GO CAVS!!!
YogaBeer::trap game for the Bobcats
nargash::Stop hating on my girl..!!
Partridge1150::Just in: Marreese Speights is a starter  They better announce that tomorrow .
randumo24::If it isn't broke, don't fix it.
neonyte::No reason to mess with a good thing.  He gets about the same minutes as Zeller.
Partridge1150::got a double double within 16min, they need to.
You just won the internet::i hope they dont he needs to lead our second unit
nargash::They won't..!
You just won the internet::why is Gee still starting
Sleo810::We don't need shabazz!!!!! No more young players!!! We need to trade our number 1 pick for a proven PF that can get us 20 &amp; 10... Call blazers,hawks ,jazz, T-wolves...
xavier41196::Just waiting for Lebron
neonyte::SF is definitely their weakest position
YogaBeer::Who else would you play?   Omri?    start Luke ?
iWitnessAccount::Defense (and no better options)
steve mctowelie::he is our best defender
nargash::So we can get Shabazz..!!
nargash::Anyway, great to see blowout. Let's keep up this against Magic on friday..!!
browns fan 97::yeah i hope they can #GOCAVS
ctown8686::Go Cavs, Cat's fans keep your heads up, you'll get better.
Indians1028::Did you guys read the story of the mom who took her son's letter of intent?
11ClevelandSteamer11::I cant believe we only have 4 more wins than this team...No offense Bobcats fans.  Hang in there.  Itll get better when MJ leaves
Kaultar::MJ will never leave.
nargash::Who remembers the picture where Parker and Duncan were holding a fake Joey Crawford in Halloween day?
Indians1028::I loved that
Phil__Dawson::Go Cavs!
Indians1028::What is worse the Bobcats or LeBron's hairline?
yata-9arasu::Hairline.
randumo24::Nah, at least LeBron can cover up his hairline.
1mproperDancing::Well that was a massacre.
nargash::HAHA Joey Crawford talking to Parker before the Spurs game and Parker looks really unhappy. Bad bad sign..!!
Indians1028::Walking Dead commercial ftw
wtfiuwts::It's a little rough in Cleveland right now, but man it could be worse. Charlotte is awful. At least the Cavs can say they have youth and are missing one their best players. How was Charlotte allowed to build such a monstrosity of a team.
Wesley-Mike2012::Believe it or not, Kemba is having a very good year.  This is one of the bad games that everyone experiences.  Kemba's the real deal just had a bad night.
Wesley-Mike2012::It's called not planning properly and not having the right people in the places.  We are in the process of correcting that but it will take time to clean up the mess.
CursedClevelander::"What do you mean? I'm a drafting genius! Kwame Brown's an all-star, right?" - MJ, calling from the golf course
Impounded216::The answers is MJ. don't let that man ever make draft picks.
AGirlThatLovesSports_::you and everybody else in the league who thinks so. Just shut up with he's too small to play in the league crap. He's undersized. That's ridiculous!
wtfiuwts::Umm.. we could start with the fact that he is an average, undersized guard..
AGirlThatLovesSports_::what's wrong with Walker being their best player?
steve mctowelie::its not MJs fault that these guys arent as good as MJ thought they were
wtfiuwts::I guess not. When your best player is Kemba Walker, things have gone horribly wrong.
CursedClevelander::33 to 6 assist to TO ratio. Not gonna lose many games when you put up that number.
nargash::over 201. I won you stupid gamblers...!!
RayLewis KilledMe::Lebron James!!!Lebron James!!!Lebron James!!!Lebron James!!!Lebron James!!!Lebron James!!!
Indians1028::Sucks dic.k
Indians1028::JONES
nargash::I knew Kyrie would love Speights and they are already having fun..!!
ctown8686::Wayne Ellington is like $@%!$@ on steroids
yata-9arasu::Lol.
Wesley-Mike2012::My Bobcats are getting mangled right now.  Can the Cavs please call off the dogs.  You have really pounded us tonight.  It really looks like we will have to get Noel( don't like it cause he could end up like Biyombo) but this draft will be one of the talent-less in a while.  Maybe we can try to get a Pau Gasol or someone in here that either is a defensive monster or offensive monster in the paint.
1mproperDancing::I think the Bobcats will take McLemore if they get the first pick, not Noel.
Wesley-Mike2012::Thanks.....  We will return the favor someday...
NDCHEG2012::We're at the end of our bench. Dogs have been called off.
Impounded216::could have put the cavs dancers in and we still would have crushed them.
You just won the internet::why did grizz trade everyone
quickbr0wnf0x::$how me the money... or lack thereof.
steve mctowelie::jon leuer cant pass up a talent like that
RayLewis KilledMe::Lebonr James!!!Lebonr James!!!Lebonr James!!!Lebonr James!!!Lebonr James!!!Lebonr James!!!
