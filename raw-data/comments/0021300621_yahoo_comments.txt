Cyril::The Clippers need a good backup forward/center for those occasions where Jordan or Griffin get in foul trouble or even when they just need a breather.  Jarvis Varnado is destroying competition in the D-League.  He just had a 14-point, 16-rebound, 10-block triple-double in his last game, and earlier in the year he had a 23-20-7 game.  He's averaging 12 rebounds and 5 blocks.    I know it's just the D-League and he won't be able to replicate those stats in the NBA, but at this point he can't be any worse than Ryan Hollins or Byron Mullens!
Tony H::They ought to try playing Biyombo at the 4.  He is very good on defense but not much on offense.  They have big Al for that though.
creep::Pathetic. Couldn't even beat the Bobcats.  Reinforces what I've said all along. Overrated.
creep::It's OK Clippers. You always have your Pacific division banner and highlight dunks to admire.
David::The Clippers need to protect the ball better. Turnover ratio 12 (LAC) to 7 (CHA). Steals 3 (LAC) to 6 (CHA). Its hard to win that way.
RobB::Trade Gordon for Jamison and bring Jamison home to NC.  Neither player is playing now anyway.
Hans PaHead::I'm expecting to see a flop by a Clippers' player.
HIP2CLIP::I don't remember anyone in the last decade ripping the boards like DJ is right now.
Rodney::Lob City Baby!  Handling business while the master orchestrator is on the mend.  Gotta love how the Clips just keep on winning games.
donald::McBob: it's gotta be the hair.
