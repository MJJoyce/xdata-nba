Emil4617::Lakers won yesterday..... My head is exploding.....NOT.Nor will my head explode if they continue to win, thats what some joker was saying..Good luck the rest of the way Lakers..
Demoted::MPJackso Pau Gasol got robbed for finals MVP for the 2010 finals.  The Lakers lose that series if pau doesn't play like a superstar...  Biased, no basis in reality....  Pau Gasol disappeared in game 5 with a 12 &amp; 12 game (good rebounding but weak point output) in a game where Kobe went off for 33 &amp; 5 and the Lakers lost that game going down 3-2...  that is not MVP calibur
Le Brick::Lakers will probably win on Sunday, then they'll most likely lose to OKC....... I think they'd have to lose though, because if they were to happen to win, there would be a lot of Lakers-haters heads exploding.
MWP saves the day::Lakers won 12 of the last 17 games...thats a .700 record since they got their ish together. And thats with playing poor defense and being the worst free throw shooting team in the league. Sorry haters, the Lakeshow is coming back!
Le Brick::.500 here we come!!!
ElvinHayesRules::My god the Lakers are bad...still have a losing record with the refs desperately trying to help them every single game...?  Pretty tragic...
soulsnake::well thier next game is tuesday right, against OKC, we shall see.
MWP saves the day::next game is Sunday night at home against the Hawks
soulsnake::that's any team in the league.  look at the kings take the heat to 2OT's.
numb1lakefanespn::lakers can beat any team if they really wanted to
Julian N Michelle::Guess they didn't want to beat denver
soulsnake::don't they want to beat all 82 teams that they play?
numb1lakefanespn::mamba killed the wolves
soulsnake::yeah, he sure did, too bad they are horrible team,
mpjackso::The Headlines should read Opps sports nation, we made a terrible mistake by entertaining the idea that Lebron James is a greatest basketball player.  We apologize on behalf of ESPN and assure you that this mistake will never happen again.
lasportsfanforlife24::In June ESPN Headline will read Lakers overcome all the adversity in a roller coaster year and Kobe claims 6th ring
chukhustle::And Donald sterling.
lasportsfanforlife24::or okc will trade there whole team harden was just a start
SandyBeachesinla::Not every NBA owner will pay to keep his players,,,, See Harden trade
AmazinGrapeOKC::And then you'll wake up and turn off your alarm  Get the morning paper with the headline "Dwight leaves Lakers after disappointing season"
mpjackso::lol, and magic johnson moves his thearter from LA to Miami.
I have popcorn in my ears::lol
mpjackso::or it could say that Kobe's retirement will follow the disappointing attempt to reach Jordan's mountain top.  The Lakers are pursing rondo from the celtics.
I have popcorn in my ears::Rondo is too young and fast.  They'll try to get Derek Fisher back.
lasportsfanforlife24::for the haters on here why do u keep posting and replying if you hate them so much
I have popcorn in my ears::Too much fun to harrass the sensitive Laker fans.
mpjackso::misery love company....nobody wants to be mad AND alone
Steve91406::@AmazinGayOKC  Still mad about the Lakers? Your team needs to improve to win the championship man, and you should be trolling Miami right now because they are Thunder's biggest nemesis, and the Thunder definitely took a step forward by trading away Harden, lol. That move made you feel insecure, I know, how sad, but holding a grudge against Laker won't make your team or your life better.
AmazinGrapeOKC::One game at a time  You havent seen anything....wait till Tues night
SandyBeachesinla::But we have to give him credit for helping the comments count on a Lakers related article
mpjackso::Kobe and Michael Vick have the same issues....they both play too much hero ball with a loaded team
mpjackso::I bet boston cares about that rigged game 7 the LA had to do to make up for that 2008 whoopin....but like you said only idiots pay attention to details
mpjackso::Pau Gasol got robbed for finals MVP for the 2010 finals.  The Lakers lose that series if pau doesn't play like a superstar
SandyBeachesinla::Who cares.. Lakers won the championship and I was at Staples center to watch it... Only idiots  like you will care about individual accomplishment  LeTots aka LeTest's are too freaking stupid
SandyBeachesinla::LMAO,,, Lakers went to 7 NBA finals and won 5 and thats why you sore losers are following them like little kiddies
timbeebe2::If hero ball takes you to 7 nba finals than it is what it is
AmazinGrapeOKC::Dominant bigs took you to 7 finals
SandyBeachesinla::Over 5000 comments for another Lakers related article and these losers wonder why Lakers have so much media coverage......
AmazinGrapeOKC::Keep crying about it
SandyBeachesinla::Keep Posting,, you only make my argument stronger
mpjackso::Wade is better than LBJ because last time I checked, 2 beats 1 every time.  -Michael Jordan
timbeebe2::I think he meant 5-2 beats 1-2 every time
Chris31708::<b>AmazinGrapeOKC - didnt put Thabo on him last year</b> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So what if CP3 still ends up playing well on Sunday? That's why the games are played, can't go by 1 game, numerous times a player has struggled one game against a defender and then played well the following game against the same defender. It's only if the player has a long history of struggling against that defender it's a problem.  Everyone knows that OKC won't be able to beat the Heat, might as well lose in the Western playoffs and get it over with.
SandyBeachesinla::Heat beat up Thunder pretty good last time they met
AmazinGrapeOKC::So your a Heat fan now??  SMH
AmazinGrapeOKC::Nah....we wont do that  Thanks for the suggestion tho
Chris31708::The Heat beat them in the Finals last year and beat them on Christmas Day with the same strategy.  -_-  Therefore the last game wasn't just "1 game".
AmazinGrapeOKC::"its one game"  ----Chris31708 a few rows down
Chris31708::You think OKC can beat the Heat?!?  That last game in OKC wasn't a fluke, the Heat knows how to get in their heads.  But then again you're a homer fan so I'm not surprised you're defending OKC so much.
timbeebe2::12-5 last 17 games including a win over OKC
I have popcorn in my ears::And blown out by the Nuggets.
SandyBeachesinla::on a back end of back to back at Denver and only 3 teams have beaten Nuggets at Home
timbeebe2::24-3 at home nuggets
SandyBeachesinla::Thats why you see all these insecure little trolls posting ON Lakers related articles
AmazinGrapeOKC::Good job  And Tues you get to prove it wasnt a fluke...
AmazinGrapeOKC::we most certainly will
SandyBeachesinla::We shall see....
AmazinGrapeOKC::If OKC hadnt traded Harden.....Lakers would be in the playoffs right now  Think about it
mpjackso::who in the NBA would make the best quarterback in the NFL?.....I'm going with rondo
mpjackso::Kevin Love???? I think he would be another Tebow
Benefits Of The Truth::So you obviously have never seen Love shoot
Benefits Of The Truth::Kevin Love
Chris31708::CP3 didn't play in the 2nd game, which is why OKC won that game.  He struggled in the 1st game, but that was still a pretty close game. I bet he goes off on Sunday.
AmazinGrapeOKC::he struggled the first game cuz we put thabo on him  locked him up
SandyBeachesinla::AmazinGrapeOKC - What if ?  What if the sky was purple??    Sky is purple and Gold  and thats why losers like you follow them so closely
AmazinGrapeOKC::What if ?  What if the sky was purple??
AmazinGrapeOKC::didnt put Thabo on him last year
Chris31708::If that's the case then how come CP3 played well against them last year?  If you think that one game was enough to show who will win a 7 games series, you're mistaken.
mpjackso::Amazaing Stat Line  Did you know.................  That Chris paul average more steal per game than turnover per games for the last 4 season?  That means he takes the ball away from the other team (by himself) more than the other team takes the ball away from him.  CP3 where amazing happens
AmazinGrapeOKC::The Laker dynasty and mystique died with Jerry Buss
timbeebe2::Okc died when harden was traded
SandyBeachesinla::Sad thing is OKC couldnt afford to pay Harden so they traded HIM... LMAO
mpjackso::Tony Parker = Most Underrated player in the NBA  We need to stop forcing down whatever the media shoves in our face and start a TONY PARKER FOR MVP campaign.  Everybody threaten to boycott the NBA if parker isn't annouced MVP
Sugar Ray Robinson::It's generally hard to have LeBron's numbers when you are a point guard.
LebronownsPierce::Numbers aren't on par with Lebron lol Lebron had to carry the Heat at the beginning of the season when Wade was playing like crap!  Wade has only recently started to play with some consistency.
mpjackso::tru, but his per 36 minute numbers beat that of 2010 D. rose, and his team has the best record when duncan and manu been on and off with injuries.
Chris31708::He's the only PG that knows how to beat CP3.
Mark12081959::lakers beat minny at home wow!
mpjackso::Lakers need Nash to facilitate in order to beat these western playoff teams
AmazinGrapeOKC::Lakers beat a team of midgets----national news  Clippers beat the best defensive team in the league in Indy----shhhhhh
LebronownsPierce::Including the post season the Thunder have won 9 of their last 12 against the Lakers.  Please explain to me how the Lakers are going to beat OKC 4 times without home court advantage lol
SandyBeachesinla::Lets move forward KID.. You dont want to talk about last season,, that would open the door to 16 NBA titles and 5 within last 12 seasons
AmazinGrapeOKC::Jerry Buss was on his death bed and likely heavily medicated  Dont blame him......this is on good hands Jimbo
SandyBeachesinla::AmazinGrapeOKC - Riggggghhhhtt  Thats why they hired D'Antoni instead of Phil Jackson????     Again,, dumb statement,,, D'Antoni hiring was approved By Jerry Buss you dumb $@% Phil Jackson doesnt need to Coach the team he owns
AmazinGrapeOKC::Riggggghhhhtt  Thats why they hired D'Antoni instead of Phil Jackson????
SandyBeachesinla::AmazinGrapeOKC - Jerry Buss is dead  The Laker Dynasty died with him.....sorry    Jerry Made sure team is in right hands .
AmazinGrapeOKC::Jerry Buss is dead  The Laker Dynasty died with him.....sorry
SandyBeachesinla::What happened last time OKC faced a Healthy Lakers team?
SandyBeachesinla::AmazinGrapeOKC - The Lakers ARE history....kid    Is that why you and your insecure little Butt keep trolling Lakers related articles? You are a Busted Up little ******* LMAO
AmazinGrapeOKC::The Lakers ARE history....kid
SandyBeachesinla::AmazinGrapeOKC - Yes....im aware that was your NBA finals  That is your 3rd victory over OKC in 2 years    LMAO.. Kid, are you really that stupid and blind?  Lakers NBA finals was in 08,09,10  where they won back to back titles .. You lowlife trolls dont know crap about NBA and its history
AmazinGrapeOKC::Yes....im aware that was your NBA finals  That is your 3rd victory over OKC in 2 years
SandyBeachesinla::AmazinGrapeOKC - 4-1 is what happened  you havent been healthy all year    This is Jan 27 2013 game http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400278373
AmazinGrapeOKC::4-1 is what happened  you havent been healthy all year
AmazinGrapeOKC::Ive been waiting to hear this also....
Chris31708::I just don't think OKC is going back to the WCF, they took a step back this year. Sure they're winning now but in the playoffs it's about adjustments. In the playoffs in order to beat the Clippers you have to force them to play in the half-court, which OKC aren't capable of doing. Only the Spurs are capable of doing that.
SandyBeachesinla::Trading Harden was a Big Mistake then again Cheap NBA owners who own small Market teams cant afford to keep their players.....
AmazinGrapeOKC::You gotta hit free throw to advance in the post season  Clippers arent capable of doing that
Chris31708::Look brah you need to take off the homer glasses, I'm not even a Clippers fan and I'm saying all of this.  Any OKC fan saying that the Clippers wouldn't give them match-up problems is lying.
AmazinGrapeOKC::It most certainly is
Chris31708::Free throw shooting isn't enough to beat a team in the playoffs. If it was OKC would've won the Finals last year.
mpjackso::The problem that LA is having is that star studded teams need unselfishness in order to win.  Unfortanly, that's why the heat did better adjusting than the Lakers.  LBJ and Wade and Bosh are passive superstars where Kobe coming from the era where "killer instint" was invented.  I honestly believe that if the Lakers ran their offense thru Nash more, they would win more, score more, and Mike D'toni will sleep more.
AmazinGrapeOKC::Nash said it beautifully yesterday  60 games in and they still have no identity. Are they a PNR team or a Kobe iso team???
0776Randy::Kobe hasn't decided yet
mpjackso::Chris paul is the best player THIS YEAR in LA...and im sure the standing will agree with me
mpjackso::CP3 because if you actually sit down as watch the clippers play, he is the conductor of that successful orchestra.  He rarely turns the ball over, excels and creating turnovers and assits, and has the most heart in the league barring Kobe.   The lil man is amazing.
SandyBeachesinla::No need to answer the obvious,,   Its almost like Calling Russel Westbrook the best OKC player
SandyBeachesinla::Who ever who makes you insecure enough to Spend al your free time trolling Lakers related articles... LMAO
AmazinGrapeOKC::No answer it   who do you think it is??????????
SandyBeachesinla::LMAO.... Get real kid
AmazinGrapeOKC::who do yo think it is??????
AmazinGrapeOKC::agree
lasportsfanforlife24::Only teams that fear me in the west  are None the lakers can beat anybodyy
SandyBeachesinla::I see insecure little Kids trolling another Lakers related article..
I have popcorn in my ears::How'd that work for ya against Denver, Kobe?
AmazinGrapeOKC::My god man they have bslapped you twice already
lasportsfanforlife24::1 game
AmazinGrapeOKC::Laker fans have short memories
AmazinGrapeOKC::In one game at home??? yea  In a 7 game series??? nope
Chris31708::To the people saying OKC would beat the Clippers in a 7 game series because they're 2-0 against them in the regular season now...    The Lakers won the regular season series 2-1 against the Mavericks in the 2010-11 season, what happened in the playoffs?
AmazinGrapeOKC::You are CP3 and thats it in the 4th  And ya'll are terrible from the line....we'd kill you
Chris31708::Look I know you're an OKC fan and nothing wrong with supporting your team.  I just don't think OKC is going back to the WCF, they took a step back this year. Sure they're winning now but in the playoffs it's about adjustments. In the playoffs in order to beat the Clippers you have to force them to play in the half-court, which OKC aren't capable of doing. Only the Spurs are capable of doing that.
AmazinGrapeOKC::yea.....in a loss
Chris31708::I'm not a Clippers fan, just saying it like it is.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if he outplayed Westbrook in the playoffs.
LebronownsPierce::How do laker fans think they can win a first round series?  Lakers have yet to win a single road game against an elite team!  And no laker fans, the Nets do not qualify as an elite team lol
mpjackso::Ok this is my last what if question.....who is the better player?  1994 penny hardaway or 2002 Tracy McGradY?
LebronownsPierce::Don't know about 94 Penny, but 95 Penny brought Jordan to his knees and made him cry like a little school girl!  I would have to go with 95 Penny
AmazinGrapeOKC::94 penny was probably the best player in pasketball
mpjackso::lol
AmazinGrapeOKC::Umm 1994 Penny   duh
Chris31708::OKC won't make it back to the WCF.  The Clippers will beat them because CP3 will outplay Westbrook and their bench will overcome whatever Durant does.
LebronownsPierce::Clippers don't have a go to scorer that they can lean on in tight playoff games.
Chris31708::CP3=go to scorer  Durant is OKC's only consistent go to scorer in the 4th, Westbrook is likely to crack under pressure in the playoffs again like he always does.
AmazinGrapeOKC::3-0 vs LAC this year  Bout to season sweep them on Sunday
Chris31708::CP3 didn't play in the 2nd game.  He struggled in the 1st game but that doesn't mean he'll struggle on Sunday.
AmazinGrapeOKC::No...you dont  We put Sefolsha on CP3....Game Over
Chris31708::No, the Clippers will probably win this time, it's a home game and OKC aren't <b>that</b> better than them. They match up well with OKC.
AmazinGrapeOKC::Ok  2-0 vs Clipps  Bout to season sweep them on Sunday
Chris31708::1. They've only played twice so far.  2. The Clippers will win on Sunday.
AmazinGrapeOKC::Lakers have beaten OKC a grand total of 3 times in the last 2 years...including the postseason  But they think they can get 4 games in the postseason vs OKC?????? SMH
lasportsfanforlife24::maybe if durant lives at the line like he does always
AmazinGrapeOKC::SMH....Kobe fan talking about living at the line?????
lasportsfanforlife24::didnt westbrook shoot 6-22 last time he faced the lakers
AmazinGrapeOKC::one game  He'll torch the Lakers in the playoffs
lasportsfanforlife24::Kobe makes westbrick look embarassing out there
AmazinGrapeOKC::sure he does
scabbfan::kobe heroically leads the team with most talent in the NBA over: Minnesota a 7-21 team on road &amp; missing their best player, allstar Love. kobe, what a guy.
JEGRAY53::No Gasol no Hill injuries are part of the game
MinniWolves90::The extent of our injuries are unheard of. Just sayin.
lasportsfanforlife24::lakers will regret 1 month and that month is Jan
JEGRAY53::Houston and Utah we have a problem here come the Lakers.
lasportsfanforlife24::yaaa agree^
JEGRAY53::By March 15 the Lakers will be at least the 8th seed.
lasportsfanforlife24::yepp warriors r struggling and got a brutual sch coming up
AmazinGrapeOKC::so do you
jrosborough08::....don't forget the Warriors!
lasportsfanforlife24::yes, you sound scared i would love if the lakers played okc in the playoffs
AmazinGrapeOKC::so would I  in the Last 2 years....you've beat us 3 times...including the post season  Would love to send you home again
AmazinGrapeOKC::really???
AmazinGrapeOKC::no
JEGRAY53::Really
Chris31708::<b>JKUdy - I just think durant is the difference. cant stop him</b> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Clippers bench will be enough to overcome whatever he does. Durant probably can't be stopped but everyone else on the team can. And like I said, CP3 is a better PG than Westbrook is, CP3 hasn't been out of the 2nd round before and this could be the year he finally does.
Emil4617::Chris31708- Plenty of guys can run up and down the court to play D. Yes they can, but the idea is to keep your key players healthy and rested not all have the same get and and go as the next guy who can do that  without effort. I played ball I was one who could run all day long but had one or two who would get tired and start gasping for air especially if we played a running team same goes for the pros. How many times do you think you can run up and down the court and keep pace with someone faster and stronger than you? Not trying to cut you down.
Chris31708::I feel the real reason Dwight has rarely done a fast break because he looks awkward doing it, I've seen him do one on youtube and it wasn't pretty lol
Emil4617::That is funny.
lasportsfanforlife24::Lakers if they make the dance mark my words  they will go to WCF
jrosborough08::It's possible. But the Spurs half-court offense looks good, as well as their defense.  - I'm not sold on the Clippers yet. - Memphis..ahhh no! -Golden State... too young! -OKC...not the same team from last year! -Denver .... just a run and gun team!
Emil4617::Yes they could and if they do good luck to them.
fajardous::Westbrook, who looks a lot like a Neanderthal, certainly appears to think like one. The minute his shots stop falling, he starts barfing turnovers at a high clip.
Major459::Kobe (in prime) and Kyrie Irving vs Chris Paul and Kevin Durant  who wins?
jrosborough08::OKC took a serious step back with the Harden trade. They won some games, but they looked rattled too many times.   In the playoffs they may not make it out of the 1st round.
Chris31708::No, they'll get out of the 1st round just because of Durant/Westbrook.  But against the Clippers their luck might run out.
jrosborough08::There's more pressure in the playoffs. OKC doesn't looked like the team last year. And the West has caught up to them.  Durant's is still finding his leadership; Westbrook's still finding his mind!!
Chris31708::Like if you think the Clippers will end up beating OKC in the playoffs.  CP3 is a better PG than Westbrook is, the only PG that knows how to beat CP3 is Tony Parker.
I prefer boxers over briefs::Depends.  If you get into Westbrook's head, he implodes.
JKUdy::dont think they will beat OKC
JKUdy::I just think durant is the difference. cant stop him
Chris31708::Why not?  And don't just say because OKC will have the HCA, the Clippers are a very good road team.
Major459::Lebron and Durant vs Kobe and Melo  who wins?
JEGRAY53::Kobe and Melo are better outside shooters.
scabbfan::And Lebron is 42% to kobe's 33% on 3's.
JKUdy::Durant actually has the best 3pt % of the four
JEGRAY53::Kobe in his prime or the 34 year old Kobe?
Major459::Kobe in his prime
I prefer boxers over briefs::LeBron and Durant.  Hands down.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::All in their prime?  Tough one. I'm no sure who is going to guard Lebron...
jrosborough08::You sure do love these hypothetical matchups...
Major459::I'm bored.
Chris31708::How do we know the Thunder will make it back to the WCF?  They have to play the Clippers first and CP3 is capable of outplaying Westbrook in a 7 game series.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Clips v. Thunder would be a good series to watch too.
fajardous::As bad as Dwight has been this season, THANK GOD the Lakers are not dealing with Bynum anymore. He just announced he may not play at all this season. Apparently, his knee swelled up again after minimal participation in practice.   His career may not last much longer.
mpjackso::Better what if question.......if you take the best player off every team (Lebron off the heat, KD off OKC, Kobe off the lakers)..which team would win the chip?
I prefer boxers over briefs::Ya know - I may have to agree with JEGRAY53 and say Denver.
mpjackso::I would have to go with the bulls as well or the spurs
JEGRAY53::Denver
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Bulls.  They are already competitive with their best guy out.
JKUdy::i still say spurs, they are deep
Major459::tough question
mpjackso::yup
JKUdy::who is coming of spurs? parker?
Chris31708::<b>jrosborough08 - If Dwight was healthier and Nash didn't miss sooo many games the Lakers would already be a top 8 team.</b> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's not "injuries". They're 11-22 against playoff teams and 18-8 against non-playoff teams. They're last in the league in fast break points allowed. They don't have a consistent system. Their bench is inconsistent.   Those are the problems.
jrosborough08::Nash was hurt, Blake was hurt, Dwight is still hurt, Pau was hurt and is still out Hill is out, a new coach, a new system...those are the problems
Chris31708::Well what do you expect, they're not a very athletic team. They struggle against those kind of teams, that is the <b>real</b> problem.
Major459::Magic and Kareem vs Stockton and Malone  who wins
JKUdy::they would be way to tall for stockton inside.  stockton would have to  make a bunch of 3's
DodgersLakersUberAlles::magic and kareem  and it would be a blowout. :)
DodgersLakersUberAlles::You provided some rich and compelling evidence to support your claim.   Thanks for sharing.
Major459::I dont think it would be a blowout.  it would be a lot closer than you think.
JKUdy::magic and kareem  unfortunately
mpjackso::magic and kareem....i know stockton hold the all time record in steals but i was never quite sold on his defense
