91Gmoney9009::Notice how when I start to present FACTS, little Canadian boy runs! I LOVE ATLANTA!!!
91Gmoney9009::PROBLEM with Canada  The Toronto Raptors
captinbeezo::lol
murfee1::Problems with Atlanta       Summer heat and humidity.     Atlanta is landlocked – a 4 hour drive to closest ocean.     Allergies. Don’t have them? You will.     Violent crime much higher than national average.     Traffic can be horrendous, especially for those who live outside the city but work downtown.     Cycle? It’s not a matter of if you get hit by a car, but when. Not bike friendly.     Growth has led to generic looking suburbs with big box retail and chain restaurants.     Metro Atlanta is very spread out. Sometimes the different parts of the city feel very disconnected.     The business community is diffuse – there are no true “hot spots” to see and be seen where entrepreneurs and vc’s cluster, (except perhaps StartupLounge and StartupRiot).     For a city of of its size, Atlanta has very little early stage venture capital.     There is little capital. No idiot can get his stupid idea funded. Smart people with good ideas can.     Most wealthy people focus on real estate investing rather than venture/angel investing.     There are few if any visionary business technology leaders. No Jobs, no Ellison, no Schmidt, no Zuck. The leaders in Atlanta are all service providers.     There is a lack of proven executive-level venture building talent.     A lot of wantrepreneurs who talk about startups but don’t start startups.     No critical mass of startups within one field. ISS created that somewhat with multiple security spinoffs, but there are few other examples.     Some people are very status conscious and materialistic.     People wearing Bluetooth earpieces 24/7 are a common sight, more so than other cities. They look like d-bags.     Commonly seen “fashion” on men: pleated khakis, tucked in shirt, cell phone holster on hip, anchorman haircut.     Sometimes very cliquish.     Metro Atlanta might be a melting pot of differing political views, but come election day – not feeling the melting so much.     An abundance of narrow-minded people (as compared with San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Boulder).     City government and city schools are not very good.     Older (more established) community is motivated by “appropriateness.” If seeking entrance into this community, then need to toe the party line.     Passive/aggressive is the dominate social paradigm.
91Gmoney9009::You get this off of a Yahoo article too? BTW I've lived in Atlanta for 17 years, never had an allergy.
murfee1::McGrady better keep his head up next time he sets foot in Toronto. Mocking the Canadian Anthem is a classless act by a joke of an athlete. wouldnt be surprised if he is the next athlete to get murdered, wouldnt care either.
AFarmer777::91... well stated!
91Gmoney9009::And do your research next time buddy. Atlanta is the 15th highest grossing city in the world, 6th in the United States...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta
91Gmoney9009::You never answered what your gas prices are like...isnt it something like $5 per liter LMAO? Gas is $3.30 a GALLON down here.
murfee1::LOL hows your economy down there? im pretty sure Canada survived the recession no problem whats your debt like in the states or banking system for that matter. lol hows the panhandeling problem in atlanta. Rodent problem in schools. awful highways. its a blip on radar what the point of ever going to atlanta unless i need a can of coke. clearly you never been to canada as we have no snow right now and its 46.5 farenheit since US is dumb enough to stick to the imperial system costing them even more money.
91Gmoney9009::Actually the economy of Atlanta held up much better than most big cities across the US. As far as rodent problems in schools, you must have read some useless article off of Yahoo. Why are our highways terrible? Take I-75 from Michigan to Georgia, you can immediately tell when you are in Georgia because we actually do pave our roads. Lets see what else...we have the biggest aquarium in the world. One of the greatest baseball franchises in the history of the MLB. And I actually have been to Canada, I lived in Michigan for 4 years, 2 hours from the Canadian border.
murfee1::good one, your clever. what are you atlanta educated?
91Gmoney9009::You live in Canada is there even a need to argue? Whats the weather like up there today? It's 71 and Sunny here right now. By the way, what are your gas prices looking like up there? An educated person should be smart enough to know Canada is not the place you want to live.
murfee1::ya t-mac is gonna take you to the promise land haha good call bud. your a joke stick  to incest or robbing folks or whatever you do in atlanta
91Gmoney9009::murfee is an idiot, just ignore him, its clear he's never been to Atlanta.
captinbeezo::ummm im lost but ok.. i didnt say tmac was gonna take us to the promise land, but he will play his part, Joe is our superstar,  go play hockey.. or ice skate. im going to lennox to shopping which is 10 min from my condo.
91Gmoney9009::Quit liking your own comments tool bag.
91Gmoney9009::Who cares its freakin Canada!
captinbeezo::canadian murderin someone?? lol ur crazy.. go build a snowman a knock it down. t mac found his home in the atl.. toronto will never be nothing in basketball, Tmac left 14 years ago.. 14 years
captinbeezo::the hawks are super underrated! the most underrated team in nba. its ok. When the hawks are # 1 in the east everybody will wake up. The hawks never looked the way they look now. i watch every game, and i noticed this team is forreal. And joe johnson is definitly a superstar. 1 of the best in the nba. only thing lebron has on joe is a bigger mouth, bron is faster and dunks more. Joe shoots a better jumper, floater and three point shot. and he's been way more clutch many playeres in the nba. 16-6
Lebron_Chokes_In_The_4th::Damn the Raptors are garbage. They really need to fire Colangelo especcially with his crap draft pics.
Erasisn::Horford going down may have been a good thing for the Hawks. Joe Johnson and Josh Smith have really impressed me by becoming leaders on this team. Especially Joe. He's earning his paycheck and even though Horford is a great leader, it may mean more to the guys to here it coming from who really is the team's best player.
91Gmoney9009::Horford wasnt doing anything before he went down anyways. 12 points and 7 rebounds. I think those were Zaza's numbers last night, if not they were pretty close.
CandySparker::I like JoJo.
AFarmer777::Hawks have the 4th best record in the NBA (beaten the Bulls &amp; Heat) and only lost to the Bulls the other time by 1 point but they don't deserve any articles. Let's write about slam dunks since in 20 years people will remember this Clippers slam dunk dude... not who contended for the NBA Finals.
91Gmoney9009::The Hawks look better now then they have at any point in the last 10 years in my opinion. Lets just hope they keep it going for the next 44 games.
AFarmer777::I think since Atlanta plays well as a team (usually teams who win championships play well as a team and do NOT have elite players) this is mundane to sportwriters so they overlook the Hawks. This is fine, keep overlooking and we'll stay a half a game back of the Heat (who we beat in Miami).
J-SMOOVE2019::Someone posted it earlier.  Yeah, I really really like the Hinrich/Zaza for Varejao deal.  I always thought Varejao was the 2nd best player behind LeBron on those Cavs teams.  Dude has been posting some serious numbers lately.
91Gmoney9009::I see what you are saying but if we could give up those 2 guys to get Varejao I think it would benefit us big time. Especially next year. Move Horford to PF and put Varejao at C. Teague, Johnson, Smith, Horford, Varejao= 2013 NBA Champs
dudemanbro2::not that great a deal imo, if the hawks trade pieces for a big man it's gotta be one that has some scoring skills in the post, not a hustle/energy big man
91Gmoney9009::Oops, 13
91Gmoney9009::Hes averaging 16 rebounds a game over the last 5
dudemanbro2::his first of his career, ever player has his night but that doesn't automatically make him a skilled post scorer, he;s an energy/role guy and always will be
91Gmoney9009::Varejao had 20 and 20 last night
91Gmoney9009::That would be sick!!! Idk if Cleveland would do it tho
J-SMOOVE2019::If we keep this up, the NBA better consider Larry Drew for coach of the year.
J-SMOOVE2019::Finally a coach that has the correct starting unit out there.  Teague, Johnson, Williams, Smith, Zaza.  I dont know how many times Mike Woodson $@%!$@ it up.
ATLrepresent11::http://games.espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=7sugram Okay, before you go bashing this, think about it. First, the Hawks would have to throw in a draft pick too. Now, the Cavs need some veteran leadership, and Hinrich can offer that. I know Irving has the PG position locked in, but Hinrich can still offer some play at SG. Or come off the bench like he is in Atlanta right now. Zaza would be a fair replacement for Varejao. Atlanta would have the big man down low that they need. This trade is kind of a stretch, but not impossible.
dalemurphyjr::T-Mac is gonna win a playoff series finally
J-SMOOVE2019::We wont finish 1st or 2nd, b/c Miami and Chicago will, but we need to finish 3rd or 4th to have some homecourt advantage.  ESPECIALLY if we have to play Philly.
ATLJoe22::Philly is kind of scary because they are one of the few teams who are just as athletic as we are
RonoSL550::Hopefully he stays healthy. I think he's helping Joe be a better leader on the team. They play better with the guy on the court.
RonoSL550::We did it for Jamal Crawford, why not Tmac?

They are one of the SHI*&amp;^st teams ever to suit up for basketball at any level.  Look at their record to confirm the truth.  Sh(*ty

atlhawks27::the game i cant wait for is the hawks vs the lakers two of my best teams going at it toughs are the only two teams i love. but ofc im going for my hawks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hawks fans make some damn noise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dont you seat down in your damn seat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! get up! get up!! get up!!! get up!!!! get out of here and gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for my lakers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
jacklondon1234::I have bet on sports for almost 3 years now and have used endless numbers of handicappers. I started using a website called sportsbettingstar.com . Since signing up after Christmas I am already 16-0 on hockey and basketball bets combined. It is a 2 series chase system but is out of this world. I almost wonder if this Chad guy pays off to have the games hit his picks. Thought this might help you sports bettors out there that are not winning
netsbucs::i want to see raptors incoprate amir johnson in their offense more i think he needs more minutes and honestly it wouldn't be a bad idea with bargnani out. they should also still give 25+ minutes to james johnson see how well he can play consistenly. NET FAN JUST GIVING OPINION.

Demonjoe93::GO HAWKS!
J-SMOOVE2019::Zaza/Hinrich for Varejao?
atlhawks27::if the hawks can get the right big man dont be shocked if they win a title.
KingGeorge53::Trade for Anderson Varejoa?
uscatl::Very much agree.  This team seems the best and most mature.  Besides our mental issues, are biggest issue by far was our lack of size.  No way Horford is 6-10, 6-9 might be a stretch.  If we get a C who can play defense and do enough offensively to have the opposition's attention, watch out!
cmajor26::Jeremy Lin and Renaldo Balkman leading the Knicks to victory lol.
FingerRoleJoeTM::Lets have this talk...what big man could the Hawks realistically get to make a run this season, before the trade deadline
Afoah91@unm.edu::Gortat from phoenix?
cmajor26::Well Twin is just awful so it's an upgrade if he can stay healthy
FingerRoleJoeTM::he's awful fragile.. but id take him
cmajor26::First name that comes to mind is Joel Przybilla. The man rebounds almost as good as Dwight
jbfreeman62::Later all time to start off a Tough February run with a mini homestand
atlhawks27::the hawks most home sted is in april thats the best time to have a home sted
