Clipperdude::Finally the last game of a long road trip. Jamal looked so fried the last game he could not even hit his free throws.Doc's strategy is good, use the Clippers athleticism but it is like cutting the legs out from the 3 point shooters. Clippers cannot rely on the 3 pointers until redick gets back.
PKM::Charles Barkley was bullying Blake Griffin.
Christopher::simply can't believe how much the Clips roster changed from last year. I just don't see where this is going. Maybe Redick according to stats was a better replacement but other than that? I see no roster improvements.
Shaun::Go Wizards beat these overrated scrubs.
Donald The Heckler::Wizards will #$%$ this game faster than Harry Potter the Golden Snitch.
Blobby Dooley::Chris Paul scores 38 big deal do it against the Thunder than brag.
Tony Anthony::Oh #$%$. This one's over.
fup duck::Paul's best game in years
BossMan::Playing the Wizkids as a "Game 7"??!!??  BWUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
Rodney's daddy::My boy Rodney needs to quit spending so much time with the likes of Ben, Hip, Clank, and the other gayboys. I'm gonna put him to work out in the fields! Make a man out of him!!
