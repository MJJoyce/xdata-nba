mizer35752::was at the game, and new york 17 jerseys were all over the place. that stretch last year was good times for us knick fans.
Gmello6869::You know Jlin is improving on his game when u have Stephen A Smith say he starting to have regret  that Jeremy Lin isn't on the knicks anymore.. This was on 98.7 espn
setrue::SAS changing his negative tune against Jeremy Lin and finally acknowledging what all rational NBA fans already knew about the greatness of Lin, shocking just shocking.   Time to stick a fork in the Knicks because they are done.
Tstrike29::JLin is an exceptional PG... I like how he concentrated on D tonight... the Stats do not show the yeoman's work...    But man when that guy gets going, its a nightmare for the other team (who has to really worry about Harden all night)...
Tstrike29::I want my Rockets to stay the 8th seed and face SA... I-10 = more home games...
Rockets_blowout_teams_by_30::Rockets have to "win out" mentality to keep Lakers OUT of playoffs!!
no hope for the human race::keith bogans = GARBAGE
Rockets_blowout_teams_by_30::what prompted you to say that??  nevermind, cancel
Rockets_blowout_teams_by_30::Houston has already GROWN leaps and bounds and now they will have another SPURT with T-Rob coming in!!
Gmello6869::Houston Rockets has a bright future..Young athletic and have time to grow!! Cant say the same about my knicks..
Gmello6869::Agree! What I've meant to say,I see them being a top contender in a year or two!
Rockets_blowout_teams_by_30::Rockets already grown
no hope for the human race::keith bogans = garbage
nba is the worst::13 straight?  That's impressive.
hookem5746::Go Rockets!!!  Kick the crap out of the Wizards now!!!!  Got to beat all our below .500 opponents to finish strong.
Rockets_blowout_teams_by_30::and to keep Lakers out!
miami360x::Go Rockets. We're counting on you to keep the Lakers out of the playoffs.
wasteland511::Yes go rockets I can't stand the lakers
Dezagcoog::Night everyone. And good night loser. Go get a life. They're not hard to find.
HoopsSharpie::awwww, it's warm milk time for the little guy.
ScrewedUpTexan713::Its amazing how young this team is and how short handed they are and to pull wins against OKC and Brooklyn is just like ...whoa !
cfylong::Count on Lin being a winner.  His stats didn't come through today, but he facilitated and operated and D'd up.  Those are the intangibles that make him and his teams win.
HoopsSharpie::performances
ScrewedUpTexan713::oh yea but there young soo yea ups and downs with a young team like this
ScrewedUpTexan713::expect better what ?
HoopsSharpie::learn to expect better
Dezagcoog::You keep making stuff up and can't back ANY of it. Get a life dude. I don't understand your obsession with Smith but he's not on the Rockets and won't be for AT LEAST a few months. So grow up already.
JTiger83::The problem with Josh Smith is how will he get along with Harden. Could there be chemistry problems? He's also in the final year of his contract and it is no guarantee he returns to Houston if the Rockets had traded for him. Sure, they could offer max but there are probably a couple of teams that will do that. Smith may prefer to be the #1 scoring option elsewhere instead of being second banana to Harden. Then again, Howard may want it to be the same thing....so hope to sign Chris Paul? Have Lin come off the bench as an instant offense sixth man next year, then wave him around the trade zone as an expiring contract? That's assuming Paul would even be on the market.
HoopsSharpie::also, paul will technically be on the market, but not really. he's going to re-sign with the clips and loves being in l.a.  howard will get max, but let the lakers make that mistake. he's not worth max and is not what the rox need anyway.  now, if brandon jennings could be pulled away from the bucks, then that'd be a different story.
Dezagcoog::WHY would you trade Harden for CP3?????? are you serious right now??? he's 4 yrs older, and Harden has been doing things all season that only the greats like Bird, Jordan, Magic, etc have done. Stuff that CP3 wishes he had done. Dude get real.
Dezagcoog::now you respond to me? back up your words little man. Only a little man doesn't defend his own words. You have no honor and are a real loser. Go find a life somewhere.
HoopsSharpie::you fail at reading comprehension. the guy never said to trade harden for paul you idiot. he said to try and sign paul as a FA.  it's way past your bedtime little man. it's time for your warm milk and then off to bed you go.
HoopsSharpie::smoove already said during the deadline period that he doesn't need max dollars. he's not expecting max money this offseason, nor will he get it. that was never going to be an issue.
Dezagcoog::In late January, Smith said for the first time, "I feel like I'm a max player," according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He went on to deliver a few token athlete quotes about his "versatility" and him "bring[ing] a lot to the table" for the Atlanta Hawks.
Dezagcoog::I just have to say that I really do wish we could get LMA. He would instantly make us contenders.
Dezagcoog::and you keep saying that Smith is a "much better scorer." do you also have some secret insider info to disprove the stats I've shown you? Or are you also pulling that out ur as.s. Man up and prove your claims son.
Dezagcoog::instead of changing the subject once again. Be a man and backup your words. But of course I know you're a coward and can't do that. I keep talking about the ish you keep spitting son not about Howard.
HoopsSharpie::like an idiot, you keep trying to make this a discussion about smoove vs. howard. when in fact from the very beginning, it's always been about smoove vs. robinson. smart people don't even compare smoove vs. robinson, it's a joke. robinson is a nobody.  so i will continue saying the same thing, smoove is way better than robinson ever will be and would be a huge difference maker now and for the next 3-5 years. that's been the topic at hand, nothing else.  but you just keep talking about dwight howard though as if he's somehow relevant to the trade that was cancelled.  i'm not responding to your crap anymore little man.
HoopsSharpie::i already told everyone 2 days ago that we've been secretly trying to get him, get your own info.
cameraOV707::so do u guys like Lin for your long term point guard?
Brickyyy Rubio::kids young and proved much so far. are people kicking him out of houston already?
moncindy007::yes.
HoopsSharpie::if he keeps driving and dishing, i'll be fine with him. when he holds the ball, i want him gone.
setrue::Are you as dumb as Knicks owner Dolan?  Even that idiot knows he farted on himself by not matching.   The Knicks are crap without Lin.
HoopsSharpie::cameraOV707 - you want him gone? oh!  you failed at reading comprehension i see.
Dezagcoog::Yeah, he wants Smith to come play PG for us.
cameraOV707::you want him gone? oh!
Dezagcoog::I do. Whenever he plays with Confidence he plays quite well. If he can play with confidence every game he might make a few all star games.
bobbydagreat::He's alright. Nothing really special, but he'll do.
bobbydagreat::If you ever wanted to know what it's like to be in the military, this video will show you.  http://youtu.be/nGUgU15w_WM
Dezagcoog::HAHAHAHAHAHA that's fing AMAZING!!!
bobbydagreat::It happens. Honestly it's not for everyone, especially the MOS that I was in. You need a sort of flexible morality for it.
Dezagcoog::Yeah that makes sense. I think it's a personality thing. I have too many quirks and issues to be able to fit in such a rigid top down system. Like currently I'm starting my own business. I'm not the following orders type, even when they're right. It's a definite character flaw of mine, but it comes with the territory.
bobbydagreat::There were a lot of people that couldn't deal with it, but honestly, it's not as hard as most people think as long as you aren't an idiot.
Dezagcoog::LOLOL
bobbydagreat::Also, everything from the 16 second mark on is exactly what Drill Sergeants imagine goes on as soon as they leave. They're right.
Dezagcoog::I could never be in the military, I"m so anti authoritarian, ADD, and neurotic Jew that I'd probably be killed by my Drill Sargeant the very first day.
bobbydagreat::Not when Drill Sergeants were around, but yeah.
Dezagcoog::it's one of those work intensely play intensely things?
Dezagcoog::LOL did you guys seriously f around that much and that crazily?
bobbydagreat::Every day was like that when I was in AIT
Dezagcoog::This guy is worse than the hardcore LOF...he really is.
cameraOV707::sharpie I'm going to ask you one thing how can you call him the best defender when he's made the all D team once and it was 2010 and second team? lol
STEVE6163656::Last year's DPOY winner was on the 2nd team...
HoopsSharpie::#1 defender as a forward in the league by all current metrics
HoopsSharpie::cameraOV707 - IGGY Lebron over him  again, no. not by the metrics.
Dezagcoog::cameraOV707 - IGGY Lebron over him  in a heartbeat and those are only two who are above him.
cameraOV707::IGGY Lebron over him
Dezagcoog::And howard has been dpoy.
bobbydagreat::I think either Jones gets some time tonight, or he gets sent back down to the D league.
Dezagcoog::Yeah that's probably true, and Considering White hasn't done anything special he's also staying down there.
Dezagcoog::LOL
bobbydagreat::I'd say his performance today was "special" but not in a good way.
HoopsSharpie::couldn't care less, he's junk
HoopsSharpie::bobbydagreat - Dear god, you really are in love with Josh Smith, you hate every other PF out there.  no bobby, just no. i'll talk aldridge or jefferson too.
Dezagcoog::bobbydagreat - Dear god, you really are in love with Josh Smith, you hate every other PF out there.  LOLOL I bet you he's actually Josh Smith just tyring to raise his stock with Rockets fans...
bobbydagreat::Dear god, you really are in love with Josh Smith, you hate every other PF out there.
cameraOV707::first coming from a unbias fan.. robinson is a young player who at 6'8 can average 10 and 10 because of strength and vert. he has upside. i don't think he will be as good as smith BUT i also think sharpie is overrating him he's NOT the best defender secondly he is a chemistry killer. you guys should go for howard&gt;smith he's worth the Big contract.. SORRY FOR THE TERRIBLE ENGLISH i just don't care i have class tomorrow morning
Dezagcoog::LOL you're totally correct. Sharpie is just in love/obsessed with smith for some reason. Claiming he's a much better player than Howard...he's a bit loco en la cabeza as you can tell.
HoopsSharpie::the difference is that smoove can play SF and PF, is a much better scorer, and is the #1 perimeter defender at the forward position in the league
Dezagcoog::If you're going to claim it, at least be a man and back it up. How the F is Smith a "much better scorer."
HoopsSharpie::cameraOV707 - when u watch him play compared to others do u believe it?  yes, he's very solid.  and the whole point here is that we were going to get him for robinson, delfino, and a #2 which would've been a steal.  everything everyone else is saying here about howard is moot.
Dezagcoog::HoopsSharpie - he's rated #1 by all metrics, don't take my word on it  No, take his insiders words for it...
Dezagcoog::Much better scorer... Smith 17.2 ppg .462 Howard 16.4 ppg .581  .8 ppg is a "much better scorer".   how delusional can you be dude?
cameraOV707::when u watch him play compared to others do u believe it?
HoopsSharpie::cameraOV707 - your really gonna call him the best defender?  he's rated #1 by all metrics, don't take my word on it
cameraOV707::your really gonna call him the best defender?
jalfmar29::Still not quite the foot on the neck team yet, but getting closer. Good win, if a bit nervy.
Dezagcoog::Smithsanity!!
cameraOV707::http://www.kansascity.com/2012/06/09/3649553/kus-robinson-stands-tall-at-the.html READ MY BAD HE WAS 6'7 without shoes and he is only 6'8 wow..
cameraOV707::blake griffen had a combine vert of 35... he's correct people just think 40
HoopsSharpie::yep, very undersized and not a very good leaper
Dezagcoog::bobbydagreat - Yeah only a 35 inch vertical, the same as Blake Griffin.....  LOL this guy is a clown...
bobbydagreat::Yeah only a 35 inch vertical, the same as Blake Griffin.....
bobbydagreat::Or you mean 6'8.75".....noob
Dezagcoog::LOL you did kinda go off on him, but it was a bit funny.
bobbydagreat::Sorry man I've been dealing with someone who is in love with Josh Smith for a few days now.
cameraOV707::first off i never said it didn't I'm saying idc.. u can read it yourself. why are u being a dick I'm on no ones side
bobbydagreat::3/4 of an inch makes a difference no matter what your girlfriend tells you.
cameraOV707::why did u call me a noob? I'm not gonna put .75 u can read that your self
cameraOV707::Just so people know robinson was 6'8 with shoes off and 6'9 with shoes on in the combine.. they put 6'10 but he's really not at all
HoopsSharpie::he's undersized, everyone knows that
Dezagcoog::Just like Josh smith....  but i'm still very curious to know what things Smith is soo much better at doing than Howard. Please enlighten us.
bobbydagreat::But thankfully not as undersized as Josh Smith
Dezagcoog::yeah bobby put it up earlier. The combine claimed he's 6'8.75"
bobbydagreat::Yeah, he's 1/2 an inch taller than Josh Smith.
JTiger83::The way some people were talking on here after the Patterson/Robinson trade was that the Rockets blew all chance of making the playoffs this season. Patterson is a nice player, but he was a fringe starter and Houston has a bevy of young PFs on the roster. I thought they didn't lose anything on the trade. Well, now Houston has a road win at Brooklyn post-trade.
Dezagcoog::Who cares if we make the playoffs this season. considering half of our losses came during the first 15-20 games and those were the first 15-20 games they ever played together things are just getting better from here. Who cares what happens this year. I'd rather have a young guy get playing time and gel with the rest of the team than "play for a championship." I like the idea of giving these young guys a playoff series, but if it doesn't happen, whatevs.
Dezagcoog::funny cause you're clueless about Google. Still waiting to hear what Smith is so much better than Howard at? Please share your basketball wisdom!
HoopsSharpie::akhorahil - no... they need to make the playoffs this year. In fact they need to win a couple of playoff games this year.  ignore that guy, he's clueless about basketball.
Dezagcoog::akhorahil - no... they need to make the playoffs this year. In fact they need to win a couple of playoff games this year.  Why? why is this a "need"?
akhorahil::no... they need to make the playoffs this year. In fact they need to win a couple of playoff games this year.
bobbydagreat::it's about making the right moves now to get to the next level and then sustain that next level.   we won't be able to get to the next level without a proven mid-vet guy like smoove.   -------------------------------  I know you have a crush on Josh Smith, but you seriously overrate him.
Dezagcoog::So what does Smith do that is SOO much better than Howard? Besides being a chemistry killer that is.
HoopsSharpie::we will not get to the next level with the current roster, you'll see.
Dezagcoog::No more mouthing off about smith? Can't dispute facts? just your "insider" information?
Dezagcoog::He DOES think he's a max contract player, and he's not.
Dezagcoog::OH and FYI  'In late January, Smith said for the first time, "I feel like I'm a max player," according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He went on to deliver a few token athlete quotes about his "versatility" and him "bring[ing] a lot to the table" for the Atlanta Hawks.'
Dezagcoog::and "being healthier" isn't a thing that he "does" LOL
Dezagcoog::I'm still waiting to read those "few things smith does much better than howard" that you can name but seem to refuse to.
bobbydagreat::Robinson was acquired as as a starter, not as an insurance policy.  he was acquired to start for the hawks, not the rox.  -----------------------------  According to you, and no one but you. The rest of the world knows better
Dezagcoog::HoopsSharpie - and asik was signed to be the starter, not an insurance policy  Oh well then thats the position he has to play. Since Robinson was also acquired as a starter I guess Smith is totally out of the picture too then.
HoopsSharpie::bobbydagreat - HoopsSharpie - and asik was signed to be the starter, not an insurance policy  Robinson was acquired as as a starter, not as an insurance policy.  he was acquired to start for the hawks, not the rox.
bobbydagreat::HoopsSharpie - and asik was signed to be the starter, not an insurance policy  Robinson was acquired as as a starter, not as an insurance policy.
Dezagcoog::HoopsSharpie - the point again, for the final time, is that smoove is cheaper than howard and doesn't have the injury issues. better scorer, more athletic, top rated defender.  cheaper...MAYBE. Injury issues..ok fair enough. Better scorer? ummm by .8 of a point per game...so no he's not. More athletic??? are you on crack??? Top rated defender?? more top rated than 2.3 blocks per game and 11.8 rebounds?? ohhh no?? oh ok...
HoopsSharpie::and asik was signed to be the starter, not an insurance policy
bobbydagreat::LOL, well be prepared to be disappointed because you are the only person with a crush on Josh Smith.
HoopsSharpie::the point again, for the final time, is that smoove is cheaper than howard and doesn't have the injury issues. better scorer, more athletic, top rated defender.
Dezagcoog::for such a knowledgable insider you really have no idea how google works.
Dezagcoog::doesn't score at all???  Howard 16.4 ppg smith 17.2 ppg  NEXT
bobbydagreat::Yeah, Howard only scores 20 a game....what a bum.  LOL
HoopsSharpie::bobbydagreat - No I didn't, I said I wanted Howard to play Center and Asik to stay as an insurance policy.  howard doesn't score at all and is way too timid, even on the defensive end. combine that with his loser mentality and injuries, and it'd be the worst max deal possible.
bobbydagreat::No I didn't, I said I wanted Howard to play Center and Asik to stay as an insurance policy.
Dezagcoog::HoopsSharpie - you said you wanted howard to play PF alongside asik  I said that not him...
HoopsSharpie::bobbydagreat - HoopsSharpie - name one thing howard does better than smith. i can name a few things smith does much better than howard.  Play center.  you said you wanted howard to play PF alongside asik
Dezagcoog::HoopsSharpie - name one thing howard does better than smith. i can name a few things smith does much better than howard.  really? is Smith ranked in the top five in rebounds, blocks, and field goal % too?
bobbydagreat::HoopsSharpie - name one thing howard does better than smith. i can name a few things smith does much better than howard.  Play center.
Dezagcoog::HoopsSharpie - so you'd rather pay howard max money than jsmoove a good bit less and for less years?  That's a really dumb question.
HoopsSharpie::name one thing howard does better than smith. i can name a few things smith does much better than howard.
bobbydagreat::Of course. Howard improves this team a lot more than Josh Smith would.
HoopsSharpie::so you'd rather pay howard max money than jsmoove a good bit less and for less years?
JTiger83::So you are going to pretend your team doesn't have space for a max contract out there? Talk about doom and gloom.
bobbydagreat::Of course not, but they will when they pick up Howard.
Dezagcoog::I was looking at Dennis Rodman's stats and at his peak he had a season where he averaged 18.7 rebounds per game. Seeing as how this year the top guy is at 11.8 that's INSANE! The guy was a rebounding BEAST! Would love to have someone like that on our team!
BeastMode81::And to think, he was only like 6'6 6'7 putting up those rebounding numbers. That's insane
Dezagcoog::Y'all think that Harden can raise his PPG enough to rise a few positions?
Dezagcoog::you don't think he can? I think he'll pass Kobe cause of how they've been playing lately. But it will be hard to get past the rest.
cpaqpaq1::Not gonna pass the top 3
vonsteve6868::Night guys. Fun talking with you (even the Josh Smith stalker).
Dezagcoog::lol night
vonsteve6868::I've said it before, but, man do I feel bad for Patterson and Douglas. I hope something good happens to both of them to make up for it.
3rdCoastTexan281::I was a 2Pat fan as well. He is a very good person, but really only a decent player. TD won me over a little too. They were never in the long term picture though. Most casual fans knew that. I wish the best for them....hopefully they can get out of Sacremento as soon as possible.
cpaqpaq1::Seattle is a great city
Dezagcoog::LOL true. If Pat Pat and Douglas get moved to Seattle that'll be a good thing for them
cpaqpaq1::Best defender in nba?   Avery Bradley, Dwight, iguoldala, Tyson chandler, Lebron, sefolosha, other?
STEVE6163656::Tony Allen
Lorenzomax7::Asik
cpaqpaq1::I like it
cpaqpaq1::Ratings are worth a little.     But gonzaga is also rated a one seed.    So u see where I'm going with that
HoopsSharpie::that was a really bad analogy actually.
cpaqpaq1::Eh.    I'm not sure I like him in that group.      My opinion iguoldala locks down.    I love watching him $@%! people off on d.      Coulda mentioned Deng in here too
HoopsSharpie::you might not like him, but he's top rated.
HoopsSharpie::jsmoove is the top rated defender as a forward
HoopsSharpie::this line-up makes a deep run this year and next 3 years..  lin harden parsons jsmoove asik  there's simply no debating that fact. morey knew it and did everything he could to make it happen. again, simple fact.
akhorahil::Another simple fact is... The Rockets were out of the running very early in the night and Morey didn't make any more offers after the Robinson trade went down. The only Josh Smith trade that even came close (and was very close) had him going to the Bucks.
akhorahil::You're making stuff up in your head.  The Rockets had an offer on the table and they never changed it after the Robinson trade. The Hawks wanted Parsons and Asik, Morey (wisely) balked at the offer.   They were never even remotely close to making a deal. All deals were off the table by 6pm.
HoopsSharpie::you're wrong, very very wrong.
bobbydagreat::That lineup isn't significantly better than the one they have now
akhorahil::I'm with Bobbydagreat on this one. For one, there's no way you can know what Robinson can or can't do. Especially if you are basing it off of his time in Sacramento.
HoopsSharpie::it's about making the right moves now to get to the next level and then sustain that next level.  we won't be able to get to the next level without a proven mid-vet guy like smoove.
3rdCoastTexan281::Lol window? As young and talented as the Rockets are, their window could extend through 2020.
bobbydagreat::And they made that move. They went for the younger version of Josh Smith rather than the older, head case, version of him.
HoopsSharpie::it's about knowing when you're in a window to break through. now was that perfect time to make the trade.
bobbydagreat::You'll learn
HoopsSharpie::bobby, smoove steps in right now and dominates. robinson can't even play a consistent qtr.
Dezagcoog::Seriously, you're trolling at this point.
vonsteve6868::let. it. go.
walle D_ D::Why don't we watch Robinson play, before we decide how good he can be. Will talk about it when he plays some games.
Dezagcoog::Exactly what most of us are saying. Someone is saying he's terrible without having seen him play though.
HoopsSharpie::3rdCoastTexan - there's a few more of us who wanted smoove too.
Dezagcoog::I didn't care for him. Don't like his attitude. Attitude is a huge problem for me. SheMac is all the crud I want to deal with for the rest of my life. Heck Barkley was bad enough to deal with.
3rdCoastTexan281::A lot of people in Houston did, but Morey found a way to get an even better fit for the Rockets current roster.
3rdCoastTexan281::Smith was exactly what the Rockets needed at the 4, but so is Robinson. But the thing is, Robinson is 7 years Smiths junior.
walle D_ D::I can tell you right now, no one even thought Robinson was a possibility.
vonsteve6868::A lot of us wanted him. But we're not dwelling in the past. We're celebrating the future.
Dezagcoog::HoopsSharpie - actually, most here now are saying not only did they not want him, but they actually think robinson is better. i mean, wow, it just blows your mind.  No one said that at all...grow up.
HoopsSharpie::actually, most here now are saying not only did they not want him, but they actually think robinson is better. i mean, wow, it just blows your mind.
bobbydagreat::As long as you keep it past tense, I'm one of them.
cpaqpaq1::Lets see what people think of this. My top 10 players in nba in order.      Lebron, KD, CP3, DWade,  Kobe, Melo, Parker, harden, love, rose
cpaqpaq1::I hope wade doesn't get the McGrady syndrome.   Great slasher that gets beat up And settles for jumpers late in his career
vonsteve6868::Is DWade still the 4th best player?
Dezagcoog::vonsteve6868 - Cool. Sorry. Didn't mean to sound defensive.  LOL you're good, I just didn't want to be offensive
vonsteve6868::Cool. Sorry. Didn't mean to sound defensive.
Dezagcoog::vonsteve6868 - Okay. No, my comment wasn't based on his lesser role or stats. I'm not dumb. I was basing that comment on articles I've read. Clearly they were wrong.  I understood, I'm saying that they're not seeing things clearly. Not you.
vonsteve6868::Okay. No, my comment wasn't based on his lesser role or stats. I'm not dumb. I was basing that comment on articles I've read. Clearly they were wrong.
Dezagcoog::yeah, but that's the perception cause of all the floor and usage that Lebron gets. You're telling me Harden actually got better or he just seems better cause he's getting more possessions and usage.
vonsteve6868::I can't speak from a ton of views, but I've been hearing that he's been slowing down. Like I said, I'm speaking more from I've read than what I've seen.
cpaqpaq1::DWade has become so unselfish with Lebron there.   I think he could average 30 pg if he wanted without bron there
Dezagcoog::yeah, def. he's just not getting the usage or spotlight he was before.
bobbydagreat::Melo is a joke and Kobe is too high.
Dezagcoog::Right off the bat I can tell you we all think Harden is WAY too low. LOL
Dezagcoog::read the first email sent. Love how he warns all GMs.  http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8970449/the-trade-deadline-exchange-part-1
vonsteve6868::Ha, yeah. All the GM's are thinking "I'm not going to fall for the banana in the tailpipe trick again." But then they do.
Dezagcoog::Seriously sharpie, is there ANY possible way you will EVER shut up about Smith? Please? lol pretty please?
HoopsSharpie::go to bed little guy
Dezagcoog::It's a moot point anyway cause it didn't happen...we got who we got, lets get past this. Finally most of the LOF haven't been on here so much bombing the boards about Lin and now this guy is obsessing over a player we don't even have!
walle D_ D::nothing against smith but the risk of hurting this teams chemistry is a little high with him.
Dezagcoog::is that really all you can reply? all that comes from you is josh smith and go to bed little guy. which is a seriously creepy response.
HoopsSharpie::so let me just get this straight...  you guys are saying that you didn't want jsmoove for patterson, delfino, and a #2?  really?
JTiger83::No way do the Hawks agree to THAT trade offer.
3rdCoastTexan281::I definitely wanted Smith. TRob never seemed like he was even in the picture though. When you have the option of getting a 28 year old guy, who has probably peaked and looking for a max deal or a guy that will probably turn out to be a double double machine for a quarter the price and 7 years younger, you go for the younger guy, especially on a team as young as the Rockets.
walle D_ D::the offer was Robinson, delfino, and a #2, we said yes, then they changed to wanting Asik and parsons instead, we laughed and hung up the phone.
walle D_ D::yeah, they tried to out Morey morey and Morey just stopped it there.
HoopsSharpie::correct wally. except they agreed to the trade first and then cancelled it thurs morning.
vonsteve6868::So basically they realized they would be getting ripped off with the first deal and changed their minds. I can't blame them for that.
cpaqpaq1::Id take him for that combo of players.  But was that an option? I doubt it
HoopsSharpie::it was until atlanta stabbed us in the  back
Dezagcoog::WE DONT HAVE PATTERSON ANYMORE....
bobbydagreat::I would have taken it, but they have Robinson now, so Josh Smith is irrelevant.
bobbydagreat::You'll see, Robinson is a bigger version of Smith.
HoopsSharpie::no. just no. and you know it.
bobbydagreat::He actually has the EXACT skill set Josh Smith does.
HoopsSharpie::bobbydagreat - Easily, we have a much younger version of him on the roster now.  now you're just being silly. robinson has nowhere near the same skill set as smoove.
bobbydagreat::Easily, we have a much younger version of him on the roster now.
HoopsSharpie::how could smoove ever be irrelevant? can play SF or PF, best rated defender in league, freakish athletic, scorer
Dr. Luv98::DELFINO GETS BUCKETS.
walle D_ D::For all the guys doubting robinson so early in his career think about this, he is a 6'10 athletic PF coming to a team who have people specialized in training PF. (HAkeem) THis is the best thing possible for Robinsons career, and in the long run the rockets.
vonsteve6868::He's more like 6'9" in reality. BUt Hakeem? I think McHale knows a bit more about playing PF than Hakeem.
JTiger83::No Hakeem has always been the center and Thorpe is also a PF. It's just that Hakeem was so athletic and quick to go along with his strength, he could get away with being 6'10 in the paint and still dominate.
walle D_ D::lol I can agree with that
vonsteve6868::Okay, okay. Clearly Hakeem is God. I'd be happy with both of them sharing their thoughts with the kid.
Dezagcoog::I'm not sure that's necessarily true, but nonetheless his point is valid. Instead of dismissing Hakeem you could have just said AND McHale. Cause Hakeem has taught his moves to all players and they're the best post moves the NBA has ever seen. the PF position is just as much about posting up as the C.
walle D_ D::actually Hakeem played PF with thorpe in the line up, but whatever. Also post up moves are post up moves, whether your a center or Pf or even a SF. Lebron, stoudamire, kobe, etc  all learned from Hakeem.
bobbydagreat::bobbydagreat - You do realize that Robinson is bigger than Josh Smith right?    wrong bobby.  ------------------  Time to go to school.   Josh Smith 6'8.25 221 pounds Thomas Robinson 6'8.75 244 pounds
walle D_ D::Smith undersized actually for PF.
HoopsSharpie::he plays both which makes him so valuable
Dezagcoog::espn has smith at 6'9" and Robinson at 6'10"
walle D_ D::Robinson is bigger, and they both are freak athletes, Josh Smith doesn't have the best of attitudes though
Dezagcoog::bobbydagreat - Doesn't matter, those were their combine measurements  fair enough
bobbydagreat::Doesn't matter, those were their combine measurements
dj_kelo05::List of Sleepers FA this off season  Nate Robinson Daniel Gibson * Shaun Livingston (defense is nice) ** Will Bynum Jose Calderon Jarrett Jack *** Chauncey Billups (the dude can still ball ask Kobe) Tony Allen ***** Beno Udrih Al-Farouq Aminu **** Nick Young ****** Paul Millsap ******* Mo WIlliams
HoopsSharpie::jack millsap williams allen  those are the only 4 worth something
3rdCoastTexan281::Gone for a couple hours, and this guy is still here screaming about not getting Josh Smith...haha
Dezagcoog::LOL for the past two days now
vonsteve6868::HoopsSharpie  it's called trying to get to the next level and atlanta stabbed us in the back. --------- It's okay. The Rockets just stabbed the Kings in the face. Repeatedly.
vonsteve6868::.
Dezagcoog::HoopsSharpie - jsmoove far better athlete and leaper, and defender, and scorer  I'm glad you can tell all that from the 4 games that Robinson played. I'm sure it's your insiders who told you this.
bobbydagreat::And he's older and much more expensive, not worth it.
HoopsSharpie::jsmoove far better athlete and leaper, and defender, and scorer
HoopsSharpie::meh, not really.
bobbydagreat::vonsteve6868 - They both have an 8'10" standing reach.  Fair enough, so if one is "undersized" they are both "undersized"
vonsteve6868::They both have an 8'10" standing reach.
Dezagcoog::HoopsSharpie - bobbydagreat - You do realize that Robinson is bigger than Josh Smith right?  wrong bobby.  he's an inch taller actually.
Dezagcoog::bobbydagreat - You do realize that Robinson is bigger than Josh Smith right?  are you actually asking him if he realizes something that is easily googled? He just asked his insider buddies and they said that your wrong.
HoopsSharpie::bobbydagreat - You do realize that Robinson is bigger than Josh Smith right?  wrong bobby.
bobbydagreat::You do realize that Robinson is bigger than Josh Smith right?
HoopsSharpie::vonsteve6868 - Well, he's had limited minutes for half a season on a dysfunctional team. So you're probably right. He's peaked.  he's an undersized PF who can't score, sorry if i'm not doing cartwheels.  i think i would've rather had jsmoove, yeah.
Dezagcoog::vonsteve6868 - Well, he's had limited minutes for half a season on a dysfunctional team. So you're probably right. He's peaked.  LMAO
vonsteve6868::Well, he's had limited minutes for half a season on a dysfunctional team. So you're probably right. He's peaked.
Dezagcoog::Cause he's obsessed with Smith. He wants Smith to come to the Rockets so he can start stalking him....
HoopsSharpie::vonsteve6868 - You and one guy over at CBSsports feels that way.  robinson just isn't that good
bobbydagreat::LOL how do you not see that?
vonsteve6868::You and one guy over at CBSsports feels that way.
HoopsSharpie::Selvin, you're still thinking about how patterson and delfino could've turned into jsmoove.
vonsteve6868::I think we all assume Morey will use that Suns 2nd rounder as a trading chip. But the way he's been drafting second rounders lately, maybe not.
vonsteve6868::Come on Parsons. As the Rockets most tenured player I expect more than 10 points. (sarcasm font)
YaImFromCleveland::I saw a bunch of a white fans sitting in the nice seats cheering for Lin.  Didn't know the rich Jews of NY followed Lin?
Dezagcoog::wow...anti-semitic much?
HoopsSharpie::we'll work to grab monta in the offseason too
bobbydagreat::Why?
bobbydagreat::And as we all know Monta Ellis would LOVE to become a bench player.....
vonsteve6868::Personally, I think an active shut down defender on the perimeter would probably help the team more.
HoopsSharpie::actually we do when harden goes cold. need more scoring guard depth bottom line.
bobbydagreat::LOL as we know the Rockets have a hard time scoring.....
HoopsSharpie::sixth man bench scoring is needed, badly
