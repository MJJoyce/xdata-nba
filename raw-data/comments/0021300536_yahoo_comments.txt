James::Monty may still have that philosophy but other than Anthony Davis, who else is going to play defense.
cytherian66::For Monty Williams being regarded as a defensive minded coach, his team sure doesn't reflect it on the court. They consistently will take an entire quarter or half off as well.
David::That was an impressive finish to the 1st half Mavs, especially by Ellis. Now don't forget that the Pelicans will try to make your lead disappear as quickly as possible at the beginning of the 3rd period. You will have to match or beat their intensity.
Pro::Why no Tyreke Evans? I imagine him helping the pelicans with Jrue Holiday out a while... Or not. No wonder why they're down 17 smh
Whocares::anthony davis will win a couple of mvp's in his career. he's a throwback he's on the boards on defense steals, blocks kinda like timmy. why can't the knicks get a kid like this.
Ron::what's with tyreke? 0-2 and 9 mins.. is he injured?
Anton::I really thought the Pelicans would be great with this star-studded team...oh well...
David::The Mavs need to step up their DEFENSE. They did have a big lead. Nowitzki needs to come back in too.
PKM::Fear the Pelicans
LaToya D. Hurd::GO MAVS
