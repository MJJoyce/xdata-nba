Wingnut::Super stars don't have a box score of 2 pts. Green is way to inconsistent for the C's
Dan::Boston is rebuilding and the Wolves dominated them like they should have.   GO WOLVES!
Anton::It's funny how Boston has better record than the Nets and Minnesota has better record than the Rockets.
Mj Oskar::When you lose to Minn reality should set in Celtic fans.
A::how many titles have the Wolves won?  Oh that's right zero, Celts will be a contender again before the wolves go anywhere, count on it
Ralph::this Faverani guy could be a fantasy beast with regular playing time
Dan::Wolves "should" get back on track tonight. Wolves!
Shane F::why faverani is not getting 30 to 35 minutes a game is beyond me. he rebounds, blocks can shoot and hes a after thought. they keep benching him and he had a great game again. The only thing i can think of is he is hurt. Right now hes the most talented big man they have.
You Don'T Know, Bo Knows::The Wolves will be sure to start winning those tough and very close games we've lost this year.  Tonight will just be another win against a sub-par team.  Wolves will make a 15-20 game swing this year and are a lock to make the playoffs and move up the playoff bracket.  Go Wolves.
RedtongKid::What? Green more TO than Pts??!!
