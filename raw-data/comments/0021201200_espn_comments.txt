OKC Girl::good win
Maha1755::Toney, Jimmer please don't shoot so much... Kings are going to even show up tonight.
koda1323::everyone else sucks epically Smart
koda1323::Jimmer is the best player on the kings
Queen88022::"Houston Rockets – Jeremy Lin Perfectly Complements James Harden"  "Once again, maybe the Rockets will reach sixth. It really doesn’t matter. As long as Harden is the guy who calls all the shots on the floor, their ceiling for success is limited. The smarter ball handler should get more possessions, even if he’s the less talented player. Unless that attitude is quickly embedded, the Rockets don’t have a chance of making it past the first round."  http://sportige.com/houston-rockets-jeremy-lin-perfectly-complements-james-harden-04-2013/
TX rainman::MVP: James Harden had 29 points (9-for-11 shooting), five assists and three rebounds … in the first half.   ROFL GWB
GEORGE. W. BUSH IS THE MOST BELOVED PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME::HAREN'S SHOOTING PERCENTAGE:  MARCH 38%:( APRIL      42%:(  ROFL tx rainman!!!    HAREN'S SHOOTING PERCENTAGE HAS BEEN ATROCIOUS TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN.  IF HE CONTINUE HIS USUAL 5-30FG, 9 TURNOVERS AND ZERO DEFENSE, EXPECT THE ROCKETS TO ENJOY THEIR 1ST ROUND EXIT ;)
dplunk18::who owns tie-break If the Lakers and Rockets finish the season with the same record?
Boydz in the Hood::Rockets own the tie breaker with Utah, GSW and the Lakers.
Aint Bout This Life Aicyla Edition::Houston will beat the spurss
BoboBear2222::Yeah, I think we got better chance of winning the first round against Spur than Nuggets.
DuaneXC::I don't like the idea of playing the Nuggets.  That is a terrible match-up and unfortunately even losing Wednesday might not be enough to keep that from happening.
ConvicedSince06_JamesGang::***PSA***THIS BOARD IS NOW WHITE HOT.....AND THE HEAT IS ON.....BE VERY AFFRAID....THE PLAYOFFS ARE ALMOST HERE!!!

Denzel7587::Good job, Harden for playing excellently in this game. But i hope this victory will not go to your head, and you won't play like you don't need the contributions of other players.
Denzel7587::It is unfair to judge Lin as a starting PG when most of the games he's not really allowed to play the role he was hired to do.
degjoe06::He IS playing his role very well...Give the ball to Harden and get out of the way
TX rainman::jesus christ i've never seen so many excuses for a player that is allowed to play so much
BXwarriorBX::because lin will turn the ball over if he was allowed to handle the pg duty harden is your pg and sg lin is his spot up player
J. Rockwell::No one will trade for J Lin Next year. His contract is way too back heavy for that.  The only way they are going to be able to trade Lin is during his last contract year. Teams love expiring contracts.   The Rockets thought they were getting a better player than they got.  They paid for a 17-8-3 player, but got a 13-6-3 player who leads the league in TO for PG averaging less than 32 min per gm.
Denzel7587::Your analysis of Lin's value is flawed. Lin's individual stats are not amazing, but you must go beyond the stats and the box scores to see his value as a player. When he's allowed to play the PG role, the offense of other Rockets like Asik and Smith are unleashed, but those contributions are not reflected accurately in Lin's stats. Lin is a team player; he contributes so much to the team when he plays PG, but how can you appreciate his value if you only look at the nbastats?
caltechman::I'm a statistics guy by trade and the stats are not correct because of intangible factors like Lin's leadership and scare tactics.  But who cares. Jesus Christ is coming back soon and the NBA is the least concern on His mind.
Swish3And1::You people still trolling "out of context". If you want fair comparison, compare to other PGs who are 2nd on the team for ball handling. Let's see those stats.   Anyway, all Rocket players done well as a team, exceeded all expectations!!!  Every Rox fans happy and haters still trolling. haha.....
Kassom69::He shares point guard position  with another player called Harden.   Harden is the ball handler (and rightfully so) not Lin.    On the Knicks team Lin was the ball handler due to others on that team being injured.   When Melo came back he took over and Lin's stats decreased.   Don't you trolls ever watch the game?
sports guy12::get out of here and worry about the Knicks
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Why do people like one player so much jesus.
Kassom69::You must be talking about Lebrone
GEORGE. W. BUSH IS THE MOST BELOVED PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME::"YOU KNOW I HAD TO REST HAREN IN THE 4TH BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO GET EMBARRASS AGAIN WITH HIS USUAL 9 TURNOVERS AND ZERO DEFENSE.  THANK GOD, THIS IS ALMOST OVER WITH..." ~~ MCFAIL;)
01.02.2013::@Jorge  Unless The Rox can acquire a superstar like Chris Paul at PG LIN won't be traded next season - you can bank on it.
caltechman::I think there's a good chance Lin will be traded. I think the Spurs or Thunder will pick his contract up - inside info
degjoe06::If the Spurs give us Tony Parker or OKC gives us Westbrook so we can trade him to the Clips for Paul I'm in for that.
DuaneXC::I'll be very disappointed to see him go for anything short of acquiring Chris Paul...
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Harden does not have a big ego. Harden is a star and is turning into a superstar. Players develop but the whole Rockets team is really young, but Harden has been clutch all year same with Lin and Parsons thats why the Rockets have been able to win all these close games, post all star break.
truth2dat::Knowledgeable fans who watch the Rockets this season know Harden is a "product" created for show; he is a fake superstar (padded stats, overall low FG%, lazy no D, high TO, not clutch, selfish Me-first mentality). Harden at best is an average star; probably in the same league as Lin in terms of what they can contribute for this team. This is why Lin fans whine about Harden (his ego). If it were Lebron or Durant, Lin fans will whine a lot less lol. TRUTH!
truth2dat::when you're talking Lin, don't look at his individual stats. It's not fair to him due to the way coach uses him, plus Lin doesn't care about stats. He could score a lot if he wants to though. Lin makes scrub teammates look like stars, that's his game. As I said, don't compare performance unless they (Dragic/Lowry) were being treated equally by coaching staff; look at where those guys are now instead. And please don't say without Harden this would be a lottery team, the same can be said about Lin. If you watch Rockets play at all you'll know the team thrives when Lin is in the game most of the time and lose the lead when he's out.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::This is stupid. Without Harden last year they finished 10th with a better pg, this year 6th seed. Lin has played well but Dragic and Lowry were playing like Allstars for the Rockets last year.
Bulls Bears Cubs::The whole team is different from last year.  They got sixth seed because of all the players involved, not just Harden...
findclans::I'm a Lin fan but I agree with you. the only thing is Dragic and Lowry wouldn't play like allstars if they play with Harden :)
JorgeJorge24::Hey NBA TEAMS.    Next season Jeremy Lin will be tradeD,     for coaching issues    Looks how he is outplaying Harden on last 5 games (2 of them Harden was resting from a injury).    Dont lost this opportunity and awesome player!    And dont forget all that Asian money,    The Rockets are the last on atendance and tv ratings.    And the 4th on richest team !!!    BE SMART, GET LIN FOR YOUR TEAM!
Denzel7587::If Lin is not needed as a PG in the Rockets, he should be traded to a team that needs one.
Denzel7587::James Harden is the superstar of the Rockets. he played well in this game, showing he can be a good PG and SG. The Rockets are in good hands if Harden sustains this kind of play during the playoffs. If he struggles, he can use Lin as a back-up PG.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::The suns will hardly play Dragic tommorrow. Marshall will play this means for the starting lineup for the Rockets will get to rest tommorrow. Im a suns fan but do like the Rockets. Go Rockets tommorrow.
rm90025::50% shooting is a bad game for no other player except JLin.
JorgeJorge24::LOL
Denzel7587::Lin has a better FG% than James Harden but he's still seen as a bad player.
findclans::Lin is not the best player but I still like to see him on the team. He brings so much positivity, leadership and energy to the team. He doesn't play for stats or personal interests, but the team's.
carlvu@yahoo.com::True!  Plus he loves assisting and seeing his team mates score.  That is his joy.  Rooting for the humble Hero from Harvard.
llLEGIT_ESPN_MODll::So the lakers just beat the Spurms.
Fans1000::Another terrible game by Lin, 2 assists and 3 turnovers. As a starting PG for your team, you definitely need to hand out more than 2 assists a game.
chrisausten1203::Just go away with your Lin obsession.
truth2dat::nice one troll..lol, but since we are on the topic, someone please tell harden to stop padding and let the best PG run the team? :)
TK729::Don't you realize that Harden runs the offense? Lin can't distribute the ball when Harden is the focal point of your offense.
Dawan208::Fans1000 doesn't watch the games ,  just looks at the box scores.
Dawan208::Oh not the hater again!   WE WON!!!!!!
sportsfan1014::ZzZzZzZ....
01.02.2013::BUAHAHAHAHAHA
George85146::look, you can't tank games on purpose to get a specific matchup. You take what you get. No sense going on a 2-game losing streak on purpose going into the playoffs. Just go against who we get, regardless of what happens.
23germany::denver is the target. 7th best team in west riding ridiculous altitude adv to no 3 seed  also you can not tank against suckramento...this team is so bad it will lose every game on the road....there is not a single good player and their "best" player this 16p 42%fg clown cousins is less effective than thiago splitter
chrisausten1203::Can't agree more.
jason_bautista::Rockets can instead sign Millsap.  He can score even without plays designed for him.  He's also good defensively and he's young enough.
comingincold::rockets need to go after lemarcus aldridge. he is the best powerfoward for their game. Asik's emergence gives him more of a trading asset as well as parsons.   aldridge for asik, thomas robinson, parsons, 2 first round picks
Matt8o8o8::i thought about getting Lamarcus Aldridge too but I wouldn't want this core rockets team to go...  The thought of Asik, Harden, Lin, Parsons, and Aldridge starting just makes me wonder.
Dezagcoog::Parsons is going NOWHERE.
3rdCoastTexan281::Worst. Deal. Ever.
JCabby25::No to trading Parsons. I think he's too valuable for the Rockets.
Pain No Love::too much for Aldridge...
comingincold::trade cousins and cut your losses. he's overvalued right now and you could get multiple first round picks for him. Sign and trade for josh smith makes most sense
eenz3::Is there such thing as "Too many Power Forwards"?
Dezagcoog::Not according to the Rockets. We had I believe 9 at one point during these past 3 yrs.
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::IS IT ME OR DOES IT FEEL ILKE ALL WE ARE PLAYING ARE THE kINGS AND sUNS THIS PAST MONTH HAHA
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::MCHGALE HAS NOONE IN HIS DOGHOUSE THIS YEAR UNLIKE PREVIOUS YEAR WHERE YOU HAD LOWRY AND BROOKS
George85146::brooks never played for McHale before this season
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::d mo SCREWD UP MCHALES ROTATION BUT ATLEAST MCHALE IS FIXING HIS ROTATION ONT HE FLY QUICKER NOW...HE USED TO LAG SO LONG THAT t jONES SEEMED PERMANENTLY BENCHED!!
pfoote14::T.Jonas baybay!!! 5 blks 3 steals??? damn!!!!
carlvu@yahoo.com::Another year or two, T. jones will be the power forward we need.
pdp_magi::tonight was the terrance jones show. he showed that he belonged in the league. ran the floor like a guard and was playing phenomenal defense. i think he will be a difference maker in the playoffs
jalfmar29::I saw at least a couple of those blocks. Those weren't "the guard was falling down and threw the ball at my hands" blocks either. Those were big time legit on big men.
jalfmar29::Y'all, Omer is 16 for 19 free throws in April. This doth bode well.
kblaw1::T. Jones is good. Rockets looking for good PF's, now have 4 talented young ones.
Destruct0id::Trade Asik, White and T-Rob for Kevin Love. Lure Dwight Howard to come here for less money. Rockets 2013-14 Lin/Beverly Harden/Anderson Parsons/Delfino Love/T-Jones Dwight/Smith
degjoe06::I would rather keep Garcia over Anderson
Kwonvu101::Who the heck is white?
lakerssuck90::Royce White
comingincold::are you kidding me? the twolves would never do this trade lol
jalfmar29::Anyone remember the 95 Supersonics. There's a difference between a bunch of great athletes and a team. I can't see the personalities working with either Love or Howard. I could be wrong, admittedly, but just be careful. Yeah, you might get the chance to trade one of your cogs from this year, but don't just play fantasy basketball.
MichaelKL017::Love too slow, shown bad defense, and jack up too many bricks from 3.  Howard would be nice but will cause trouble because Harden will take away his shots.   Lin/ Brooks Harden/Jack Parson/Draft or free Agent Josh Smith or Milsap / Terrance Jones Asik/ Greg Smith
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::Morey should have just drafted Kenneth Faried and this whole delima of playing nuggets would be meaningless
RushHour4LinNHarden::we got marcus morris and faried was #22 we got some euro at #23 :(
RushHour4LinNHarden::lol yup :(
Wandanle::Some Rockets fans wish to face SAS rather than DEN. It is utterly wrong! SAS never lose 1st round playoff with or without Manu for a decade and SAS is most experienced team in playoff. Although Denver swept Rockets in Regular season, the playoff is totally different beast and Denver is least experience (same as Rockets). The chance to get upset is to play DEN, period.
RushHour4LinNHarden::vinny del negro doesn't do $h!t
Dezagcoog::except the Playoffs are about coaching. Karl kicks McHale's a.ss there. So does Pop. We're essentially boned either way. Really would be nice for the Clips to move up.
RushHour4LinNHarden::remember the grizz series like 2 yr ago?
Jason Stone Lee::I believe JLin is kind of holding his offence for postseason. He just practiced his half court offence recently.
pdp_magi::tonight he got most of his offense in the third when the rox were up by 20. i like to see him score a litte each quarter, but get off to a hot start, his shot wasnt falling early but that is something he can fix in the playoffs
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::hes been holding back all season mainly due to recovering from tha knee stuff..i think linsanity will return for more appearances in the playoffs..
carlvu@yahoo.com::Hope so.  I would be cheering loudly.  Go Rox!
Open-minded Husker::Cousins will definitely not play tomorrow due to tonights technical foul.  Correct?
inityminiwur::The Rockets will be a much different team come playoffs than the one the Nuggets beat. The emergence of Terrence Jones is just huge for Houston's defense. I'd say the Rockets would be a nightmare for the Nuggets, instead of the other way around.
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::Faried got hurt though...how bad is Faried hurt? heh heh :)
RushHour4LinNHarden::^^^ both fast paced offenses but denver is crashes the boardsa bit  better and allows just a bit less points
Dezagcoog::They are a better version of us.
Dezagcoog::It's not an opinion. They run our same system and kick our a.ss each time doing it. But considering it's our first year together I don't think that's a bad thing.
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::thats your opinion and besides, playoffs will "transform" rockets
Dezagcoog::I think our best case scenario would be for us to keep the sixth seed and for the clips to overtake Denver. The clips are easily our best matchup in that top four.
RushHour4LinNHarden::ye we blow the suns gm ;) beat the lakers so utah could slip in or the refs will call $@%! on rox watch
Dezagcoog::yeah but we're at 6 now. So thats denver sadly.
RushHour4LinNHarden::not much we should face teh spurs manu out :) but timmy and tp are playing real good this yr though
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::what are the chances of clips overtaking denver?
RushHour4LinNHarden::denver in pepsi center=nightmare
Dezagcoog::They are easily our worst matchup.
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::why would the rockets want to play Denver although OTOH, they need to just play as hard as possible no matter who they play and just keep growing everything from chemistry to individual skills and performances
CelticsFanSince1996::THE CELTICS HAVE SOLD OUT EVERY SINGLE HOME GAME SINCE THE MIDDLE OF THE 07-08 SEASON. NAME 5 OTHER TEAMS THAT HAVE DONE SO
Dezagcoog::This is a Rockets and Kings board. Name fans of five other teams that belong here.
Rox_youngest_2clinch_so_yousuck::spurs is one
itsatrap13::Maybe I'll send you a roll of toilet paper as a reward.
Slambo12345::I don't think there is one but I also can't name 5 people on this board that give a f.uck
corkscrewblow::LMAO that reply made my day!
RocketsJMC::Dont worry about who they are going to be playing because no matter what they are gonna be the underdogs. Best thing for this team is to keep doing what theyre doing which is building chemistry.  Do that and the rest will fall into place
Andy58768::please lose to Suns and Lakers, i beg of you rockets!
Oaktown1029::As a Warrior fan, I've been saying for 2 weeks now - I'd rather take our chances against the Spurs - thley're without Manu and they can be beat over a series - Denver is too good, injured players and all.
jalfmar29::Some Rockets fans had been saying that too. We'll see. But neither team can be scared to play Denver. You take what you get.
jalfmar29::Yeah, same.
Oaktown1029::good luck.
MunkySnuflz::Sacramento fans: *sigh*...  Me: Hey, it's Jimmer! :D
too legit too quits::Isn't Jimmer mormon?
MichaelKL017::He's young, so he still working on his first wife.
souptwins::Do you also think people in the South still have slaves?  Both ended about the same time, ya know?
BubbaSpiker::Hey, a polygamy joke.  How clever and original.
itsatrap13::Yes. Why?
