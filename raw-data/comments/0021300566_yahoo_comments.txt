mgsc::If Victor O can cut down on the turnovers, he will be a monster.
jackstrat::I missed all but the last two OTs, why was Boozer out when he evidently did a great job early?
vorarut::it's great to be a magic fan this season - you are happy when they win and just about equally happy when they lose; can't wait for the draft day. (don't get me wrong these guys play hard)
Vincent::A win is a win now get to.500 Friday. Sad but they can be in the 4th spot in the East with a few more wins in a row and a couple of Atlanta and Washington losses.
Richard::Gee, Bulls management, by getting rid of LD, was telling everyone that it was over for this season. Funny thing, the players don't seem to be listening.
Alvin Adiwira::Stalemate. Is this game ever gonna end?
Big Poppa::It's amazing Orlando can win with Glen Davis. I haven't seen a center only  take shots from at least17ft out. Get to the rim Big Baby.
Lesh::Orlando Still continues to Suck. Jameer is definitely getting fined for the Big Balls Gesture.
emb001981::That is exactly the type of loss you want to see if you are a fan of a rebuilding team. Orlando's 2 best young players in the game Oladipo and Harris had big games, they competed all night and gained some experience in a contested game. At the end of the night you still get the ping pong ball instead of a pointless win.
chi..bear::That victo olidipo is a thug.. he and his other teammate were doing gang hand shake everytime he score big or when they  call timeout.
