blueblazer38::Those jerseys were crazy awesome
Mankle715::I am loving the jerseys
Elton7323::if we get the number one pick we shouldnt draft zeller because vuc has so much potential. so who we draft shabazz or tray burke?
Rip City Forever::Milwaukie should have kept purple in their team colors
Miller Park After Dark::PROST!
get_owned586::kids are playing great, didnt watch the game but it seems like drew should of shot more.  3-3...but only 3-3? hmmm. harkless had hes best game from a stats standpoint as well.
jpks11x::I really don't like Monta Ellis fk that loser. How dare he put himself on Wades level
Triiviium::Dude Wade had a bum shoulder and was playing on one leg in those games, saying he is like Michael Redd is delusional. Im a bucks fan and love Michael Redd but he is no where near on the same level as Wade...
Triiviium::Wasnt wade injured and hobbled  throughout that year? The next year he averaged 30.2 PPG and they made the playoffs! Nice example lol! Monta is no where near on the level that Wade is.
d_bokk::I always thought it was funny that people would say things like "Lebron needs Wade/Bosh to get his ring! LOL!!" but Lebron was going to win a championship no matter which team he played for. That's the difference between a super star like Lebron and Wade.  Wade on the other hand isn't going to do much at all without constant whistles and someone like Lebron or Shaq to get him open shots.
d_bokk::He was something like 10 for 41 in the 51 games he played, the team sucked with or without him. Wade is the same as Michael Redd without Shaq and Lebron/Bosh to make him look good.
d_bokk::Wade aint $@%! without Lebron or Shaq to hold his hand... a real super star doesn't play for a team that goes 15-67 with the overall worst record in the league like Wade did in 07-08.   Ellis was spot on putting himself in the same league as Wade.
phunky58::drew plays a great game last night,  tonights plays a lousy ten mins shoots 100% 3-3 from the field.  1 block.   etwaun shoots 3-14 scores 7 pts in 30 plus mins.      hmmm even a complete moron can see there is something wrong with this picture
epitome1986::if i were the magic, i would hire hakeem or some hall of fame center to work with nikola. they might end up with a player just as good if not better then dwight howard. of course nikola reaching that level of skill would need to have a good work ethic, which he appears to have.
ballerbooboo::did vuc have to foul at the end..wtf game is over
jpks11x::FKIN JOHN HENSON GOTTA LEARN TO SHOTO FTs
chris johnson 558::nikola vucevic 20 pts 12reb 6ast 2blk 2stl what a great future for this player
jpks11x::Fckin idiots... $@% is fixed as fck for Magic Cover
craigstersim::J.J. is a stupid f.aggot.
jpks11x::$@%!$@ %!$ HEAD SHOULD HAVE PASSED TO MIKE DUNLEAVY FOR THE 3 WTF
buckspackers23::J-Tjuan - Atmosphere is pretty good, especially during the playoffs. They pack that place. I just hope we don't play Chicago.... it won't be much of a home court atmosphere.
chris johnson 558::gg bucks fans and i respect this young group which has played tonight and all the magic fans respect them i think
mr porkchop::.
bronbronsdad::GG bucks. good luck with your with 1st round exit.
mjf131::Playoffs &gt; sitting in mom's basement on a Saturday night.
mr porkchop::U mad?
whitykj::Thanks?
Gabriel Night::GG guys
XLGrandma::$@%! YOU BUCKS
mr porkchop::OK fat gal
TheCronoMasterMind::Yep JJ is actually injured now.
Broken j::We like to win the hard way.  - Bucks
Denver and UNM Lobos::I'm ready for April, baseball will start and the NBA playoffs will be going on.
Denver and UNM Lobos::And the weather will warm up
MagicBoltzRays::nice effort tonight, but missed free throws absolutely killed us tonight.
buckspackers23::Same.
squiddy45::I like bucks announcer North Korea joke
Denver and UNM Lobos::Cody Zeller!!
J-Tjuan::Anyone go to Bucks games in person?  If they make the playoffs, I was considering traveling to Milwaukee to watch the two home games.
Doodzy4::Definitely, and Monta Ellis can lead this team winning in the playoffs. 11 assists!
J-Tjuan::I definitely am expecting Ellis to be way more active in the playoffs.  If I am not mistaken, I think this would be his first playoffs at least as a starter.  It would be pretty exciting to see what happens.
buckspackers23::Yeah, I go to 8-12 a year.
J-Tjuan::Cool.  Is the atmosphere pretty good?  I live in Alabama and I am honestly sick of watching them in Atlanta all the time, LOL
TheCronoMasterMind::If the Magic actually made their free throws, they would be ahead right now...
buckspackers23::Ilyasova always does that... wide open - pump fake - pass to a team mate - force them to take a bad shot
DNLPS::Why is Ellis handling the ball? Back to back turnovers...
TheCronoMasterMind::That's JJ's second air ball.
buckspackers23::Let him shoot that....
Denver and UNM Lobos::If you could punch any player in the face, who would it be? I'd slug Howard.
Gabriel Night::What did zaza do other than **** the magic way back?
vitrylo::I can't decide Zaza or Hansbrough
J-Tjuan::I just want to swing at him one time so he will stop the fake tough guy stuff.
J-Tjuan::Tyler Hansborough.
buckspackers23::And him.
bronbronsdad::Pachulia(sp)
buckspackers23::Nate Robinson, Rondo, or Metta World Peace. Maybe Sheed.
Denver and UNM Lobos::Lol, I'd go mike tyson on rondo
TheCronoMasterMind::Wade, no hesitation.
chris johnson 558::etwan moore is a 4string point guard he is awful
buckspackers23::I've sat through a half of basketball listening to the Bucks announcers saying "Voo-cha-vech"
stevej2555::That might actually be the proper Slavic pronunciation of it. Don't hold me to that though.
Broken j::An easy not so easy win.
whitykj::jennings thinks its the 3rd quarter
FloydGeezy89::Ily needs to get me 2 more rebounds STAT
AndrewMG20::Nikola Vucevic&gt;Dwight Howard, right now and in the future imo
Denver and UNM Lobos::Howard is a sellout
brewcrew3_3::travel and airball, impressive
buckspackers23::How'd that go in?
TheCronoMasterMind::Wow Vuc nice effort.
TheCronoMasterMind::Nicholson with 4 fouls in 10 minutes... That's why this dude doesn't get minutes.
Denver and UNM Lobos::Oh oh oh it's magic, you know, never believe its not so... Lol
NoHoldsLockout::is it just me, or do the Magic suck major *@#^$%  LOL
buckspackers23::Why Johnny Henson got a DNP -CD last night is beyond me.
chris johnson 558::wtf nicholson really can't defend any one trade this guy
TheCronoMasterMind::I like him because people struggle to defend him, but I don't because everyone can blow right past him.
TheCronoMasterMind::Another injury yay... JJ is out.
TheCronoMasterMind::That's what I'm thinking. He's been playing big minutes and this is the 5th game in the past week for him. Looks like its catching up.
Daniel83510::What happened?
bronbronsdad::he better be ok
Denver and UNM Lobos::Sanders needs to cut down on the fouls
buckspackers23::3 fouls in 28 minutes?
Denver and UNM Lobos::I'm talking about in general, whenever I look at the stats after a game it seems like he always has 4 or 5 fouls...
TheCronoMasterMind::If the Magic actually made their free throws, this would be a close game...
