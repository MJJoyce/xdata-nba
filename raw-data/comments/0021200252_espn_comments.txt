Danny Mexico::Wait, wait, wait. The Wizards?
Ken3786::Heat got caught trying to coast to a victory. They'd have blown them out of the building if they played with urgency but overall they buckled down for no more than 10 minutes of the game. Lebrons numbers look good but believe me it was a pretty nonchalant effort other than some nice passes. Too many games in the NBA season I guess. Kudos to D Wade and Bosh for a good effort, but I'll keep my $500 next time. Probably could have sat the stars with a similar result a la the Spurs. I guess they take the fans money for granted, but not mine anymore.
Dinosaur Attitude::i guess the entire wizard's team was on surprising scrub of the night?
xfactor1997::Erik Spoelstra claims their is a lesson to learn about this game but Lebron just says they just lost. What idiots! LOL!

Djuki 3::silly
steven6623::everybody on the heat not named lbj,chris bosh and ray allen look satisfied with their championship and disinterested
CoconutFaninFlorida::So what happens if the Bobcats beat the Knicks today?
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::depends on how much they lose by.  Knicks have 2 starters out, but at the same time we blew out MIA minus those same 2 starters, so its not really a good enough excuse.  It doesn't look good IMO personally...  ...But it ain't the WIZARDS lol
Djuki 3:::P
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::@Djuki haha good catch.  "Pause"
CoconutFaninFlorida::To be honest, no Amare might be a good thing.   Also, in my opinion, Wizards &gt; Bobcats

steven6623::knicks are hungry it wont happen
steven6623::melo wears protective vest under his jersey
CoconutFaninFlorida::Nah man, Carmelo and Ray are still pretty fat :)
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::I was gonna say, you realize they aren't fat anymore right?  I'm a Knicks fan and I was one of the main people making fun of Felton.  I had a really good joke about Lin, Felton, and Chinatown, but I digress.  Anyways, its not really applicable anymore lol
steven6623::two fastest fatboys on earth
CoconutFaninFlorida::Carmelo and Felton are always hungry ;)
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::So either the game DID in fact matter, or Spoelstra is just an idiot for playing LBJ 43 minutes in a "pointless" game...  Which one is it?
CoconutFaninFlorida::In the big picture, this game doesn't matter.
CoconutFaninFlorida::I just answered the question.
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::you pulled a "runtheball22" and flaked on the question haha
BlueSh1rt::The sun shines on a dog's @$$ every now and then.
nba is the worst::Spo played 4 guys 35+ minutes, lebron 43.  It's obvious he was trying to win.  You think he wants a top seed so the heat will get HCA in the playoffs?
steven6623::if spo didnt want to win he wouldnt have played lebron for 43 min
Clipper Fan Since the Jazz Flop::It was a close game that the Heat thought they could come back from after coasting the first few quarters. It didn't happen. It doesn't mean this game wasn't pointless though. It was pointless. Every team is gonna have loses.
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::But if it was pointless, why risk injury by letting the players play?
Djuki 3::yeah of course he was trying to win, every coach wants their team to try and win every game
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::"Regular Season doesn't matter"
Clipper Fan Since the Jazz Flop::This win was pointless. Wizards aren't even gonna make the playoffs...
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::So wouldn't the loss be more pointless if it was against a team that was going to make the playoffs.  Then the excuse of "They weren't trying as hard because they didn't want to get hurt, etc" would make more sense wouldn't it?  Whats the excuse for leaving your starters in well into the 4th in a game that "didn't matter"?
Djuki 3::it was at least a morale booster for them, and a well earned one
nba is the worst::So when will heat fans get concerned about the heat coasting this season?  So many posts about them giving charity, flipping the switch, etc.  Seems like they are in for the real world affecting their feeling of entitlement
Cheap fabric and dim lighting Thats how you move merchandise::The problem is most of the Heat fans won't admit it.  They want to believe that the losses mean nothing because this team has been "preordained" to win.  Which, rightfully so, they are the best collection of superstars in the league.  But to be unconcerned at all is just as naive as saying non Heat fans are for "counting this win"
21DanNYC21::with all this coasting they still have one of the best records in the east. so i wouldn't be concerned anytime soon
