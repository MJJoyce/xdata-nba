ncryns88::where can i see the highlights? i heard there was a tremendous travel and apparently the espn news anchor was laughing his $@% off too?
Deztructor::The Bobcats are tanking so Jordan can have another #1 pick in the draft.  We all know how well that went the last time..........
darkace789::i am sure i wasnt the only 1 laughing when i saw the highlights-i am not sure if they are highlights- on espn
stop the duck::its an insult to kentucky to even compare them to the bobcats...thats how bad Charlotte is
milw-jay::Ok. its official.   Kentucky  &gt;  Charlotte.      Maybe even  Kansas &gt;  Charlotte. Hell,  any of the Final Four teams  &gt; Charlotte.......
Anthony71850::Alabama&gt;charlotte.
RADSportsFan::Lehigh &gt; Charlotte

The Lakers are good at basketball::A true clash of NBA titans
Vitaly Glozman::did anyone actually watch this game?
vonsteve1668::Bad and Tanking. That's an awesome combination.
kennyx4::Is it really possible for a team to be this bad?  The Bobcats MUST be tanking it.  Right?  The thing is....if they are this bad, they're going to need more than just the # 1 pick to get significantly better.
keep it funky::All these big names on these horribles teams.. It's like watching Kelly from Saved by the Bell get spoon-$@%!$@ by Jon Kruk
freshstart_777::The Women Baylor Bears can beat the Bobcats!
KevinBryant1987::I heard Michael Jordan pays students at UNC to go watch the bobcats play.
Kobe is the MVP::Matchup of the Decade
freeyt::it's funny how john wall's success vs. the wizards team success seems to be an entirely inverse relationship
Zonacats55757::http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=170822284251
KevinBryant1987::Are the Bobcats going to compete in the special Olympics this year?
roll_tide_nc::the bobcats are not a good team
roll_tide_nc::High School was the BEST 5 years of my life
PetersoNN24::You must be an astro-physicist....
roll_tide_nc::no, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night
Iamtheunderdog23::It's really sad when the owner of an NBA team can be the star on the NBA team that he owns.
cb12490::I knew the Bobcats were tanking this season on purpose before it started and expected bad losses.  That doesn't make this season any easier...
steveny2016::Mark my words, this is a preview of next years Eastern Conferece finals
milw-jay::On  NBA 2013 from EA sports. Maybe...
thedude0612::"Let's get that Brittney Griner dude" -Michael Jordan
kennyx4::LOL!! You are so wrong for that!!  LOL!!!!!
makulu53::Losing by 28 points at home to the Wizards should get the Bobcats demoted to the D League. Maybe the NBA needs to take over this franchise, instead of the Hornets.
I_have_a_dual_enrollment_at_Ball_So_Hard_U_and_at_More_HEAD::What a waste of a Franchise!!!!!!!!
UWashington253::Kemba = Overrated
grizz_nation_will_rise::hahahaha you know you suck when the wizards blow you out on your home court.
Jimmy45795::They better hope they get the #1 pick or they not going anywhere.
Anthony71850::They'll $@%! up the NO 1 pick. I just know it.
Charlie Bailey Gates::Bobcats are a D-league team
Jimmy45795::If you put all the best D-League players on one team then you would probably beat the Bobcats thats pretty sad
minick_man83::the Bobcats should get twice the chance at the #1 pick
KashMunee::There is LIFE after Wizards basketball...ask javelle McGhee and Nick Young.....they moved up to the varsity
Dirtypaulandtheboys::exciting game! way to go wiz!
netsbucs::best player of all time: Micheal Jordan Worst owner of all time: Micheal jordan
netsbucs::now he's known for two historic things
wadlez::The Bobcats make the Wiz look like the Thunder
NUPE_NUPE_NUPE_NUPE::Sooooooooooooooo how was the pillow fight?
lordreynolds57::Charlotte Bobcats, best team in the NBA, Charlotte Bobcats
zvick11::Ok the old B.S wizards vs kentucky debate is officially dead, replaced with...... Are the bobcats the best team in North Carolina? Cuz i dont know if they'd be favored over UNC by more than 3
Propane And Propane Accessories::Al Bundy
FEAR_THE_HEAT::To Bobcats: Chris Bosh for your 1st round pick + your best player (whoever that is)
MODS_FAIL::"Steve Blake for your first round pick and Kemba"  -Lakers
arrogantespncommenter2::They've done it! They've done it! The Washington Wizards have won the NBA championship!!!!!! -NBA 2K12 Announcer
surfzone365::I really hope the Cats turn this situation around.  They are not my team, but they showed bright spots last season until it all went awry.
Jawzdasigrho::as long as michael jordan runs that team it will never happen
giants12cuse12::you bobcat fans gonna be OK come the next few years. teams cant suck this much for that long..
czechsbest::Bobcats have nice young building blocks in Kemba and Bismack, figure you get the first pick and draft Anthony Davis and your already looking much better.
Talentsojhin::Most of us trust in Cho (The GM) He helped create the Thunder and the Blazers through drafting so most of us are hoping he does the same here.
d_gettis12::hope so..
Thurmonatorr41::Damn, I'm not a fan of the Bobcats but I hate seeing teams struggle like them. I really do hope the get the #1 draft pick and get Anthony Davis and hopefully he can turn this franchise around.
surfzone365::Me too.  I almost want to pull for them out of pity.
MODS_FAIL::Jordan will draft that guy who scored 113 points
The Answer is 21::hahahhahaha wow 244 comments, the Laker game has more than 8 times that and its at half while they play the hornets, you all here are true fans
Talentsojhin::yeah, but half of the comments are crappy trolls.
MrTrev38::The Bobcats need to improve defense, offense, coaching, shooting, rebounding, ball handling, free throws and they'll be alright.
surfzone365::MJ was invincible on the court....in the office he cant do anything right.
surfzone365::Cats really must be tanking this one. no way anyone loses to the Wiz this bad.
makulu53::Well, they just lost to the Wiz at home by 28....the Wiz took a wizz on them.  The Bobcats already had the worst record in the NBA locked-up, so they did not throw (or tank) this game in order to get the most ping-pong balls in the NBA lottery.  So, yeah they really are this BAD.
GeorgetownDCman::Well i guess the Bobcats are technically getting the victory here for a better chance at the Anthony Davis sweepstakes
FEAR_THE_HEAT::Knowing Jordan hes going to pick some bust
Thurmonatorr41::Austin Rivers?
Thurmonatorr41::or MKG
