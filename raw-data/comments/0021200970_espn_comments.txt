Beanslams46::Hornets fans must be really fed up with the way the commish pretended he was helping "his" team when he blocked the Lakers trade with the Hornets, but soon after he ok'd a lesser clipper trad. He said it was going to make "his" hornets better. In reality, the commish was ONLY trying to diss the Lakers at the Hornets expense.
dwighthowardsamazing::Wow Davis's foul situation was horrible. WE HAD TO GIVE LOU 18 MINUTES!!!!!!
brandonlee562heat22::Wizards suck GO HEAT
airicad::John Wall has been playing like a superstar recently.  I hope he keeps this up.
choate_sedition::Have we ever had more quality young PG's in the league than we do now?  Wall, Rose, Irving, Westbrook, Rubio, Holiday, Curry, Lillard, Jennings   I cant wait to see who will be the best in 3 years
robertgriffinhof::They can all score, but Wall's defense is what will set him apart.
robertgriffinhof::Along with his court vision, blazing speed, and 6'5 length
Imagine LeBron Wins 8 Rings::This is a D-League Game...  Sorry lolz
ToTheTop854::I started betting a system called SportsBettingStar.  Ive made around 3k per month for 3 straight months now using this system.  You can find this system on the first page of Google by looking for Sports Betting Systems.
ravenisthebest7::God I wish Wall was healthy all year.
Swagger.N.Pomp::wouldn't matter...not like they'd win a title...they'd just miss out on the lottery...not that it matters...nba competitive landscape is skewed...a terrible product
ovechkinsgoal::wizards would obviously be in the playoffs if wall and nene were healthy all year.  18-14 in their last 32 games.  ah well.  next year.
Swagger.N.Pomp::doesn't matter, nba loads up a few teams w/ all the elite talent so there's no chance for other teams like the wizards to contend for a title even if they were all healthy.
Damn It Jim::And now Beal.
jboliv01::I'm a kentucky fan and I am proud of what Wall has been doing lately! He has really worked on his shot and I'm happy he's progressing. Good luck to the wizards in the future!
Makaveli_Better_Dayz::When do they become the Pelicans?
dwighthowardsamazing::Next season
pico2013::29 points 9 assists is a break thu game for Jon Wall.
Real Deal Beal::the important part is that he made like 8 or 9 jumpers while shooting at a high percentage, which is unusual for him.
FlimFlamDuck::he has been playing like this for the last 2 weeks
LilVdog88::We need to bring the John Wall dance Back!
itsnottagame::wizards playing themselves right out of a top draft pick...smh No need winning games this point in the season just tank it so you hopefully get shabazz, otto porter, or victor oladipo...that dude is disgusting...Im not sold on Bradley Beal...he dont have the killer instinct
redskinselportiswin::dude shut upppp! The Wizards were decimated by injuries for the better first half of the season. They are healthy now, they do not need a top draft pick to contend next season.
Real Deal Beal::Shabazz is Marvin Williams 2.0....and that's not a good thing last I checked....
LilVdog88::Its way tougher competition in the NBA he cant create his own shot like that in the NBA hes not even forward in the league thats the problem
LilVdog88::NO SHABAZZ!!! Lol he's only a 6'5 forward who cant dribble
dwighthowardsamazing::What shabazz are you looking at because Muhammad has awesome ball handling
itsnottagame::dont matter if you can dribble when you drop 18 a game
PartTimeHomer::Drains 3s in big moments. Has at least one game-winner and one game-extending shot already. Plays D so hard he gets himself hurt doing it.  Nope. No killer instinct at all. My ONLY worry with Beal right now is his health. He's a more complete player than any of the other top rookie guards.
southbeachginja::Man what a performance by Anthony Davis tonight.  Seems like lillard will always own him
PartTimeHomer::16-7 in 16 minutes.  I wouldn't call it a bad game. That foul situation was bad, though.
I AM GILBERT GOTTFRIED::BALL DOMINANT POINT GUARD VS 6'10'' DEFENSIVE PHENOM  ABSURD COMPARISON... THEY ARE BOTH GOING TO BE SPECIAL
PartTimeHomer::I need Temple back on this team next year. I get the feeling that if the guy gets comfortable and knows he's going to be around for a while, he can be a consistent contributor. I like way too much about his game.
tizi6969::wall 3-3 for 3? am i dreaming...
266noel::NBA     SUC...ING GAME           ...........PUERTO RICO   ALL THE WAY AGAINST THE EMPIRE   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.              BASEBALLLLLLLLL
PartTimeHomer::Okay.
266noel::this is the fu....ng nba    crooked      ..washington   5 points in the last 4 minutes......
Westbrick is not elite::only 82 comments and the game is almost over?  come on now... John Wall with one of his finest games in the NBA. 12 of 15. very good look
PartTimeHomer::I feel like I have half of them.
266noel::hornets        ???????    what a bunch of crap         low life nba.....
therachyone::Get off it troll.
I AM GILBERT GOTTFRIED::26.3 POINTS/11 ASSISTS OVER THE LAST THREE GAMES  THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
266noel::instead following this crap .... im happy that puerto rico beating usa right now     ...   hahahahahahaha
LilVdog88::So im watching the Gtown game and hear JW has dropped 3 3Pointers, He's on a hot streak
Marek7476::Well it's safe to say Wall is back in shape
therachyone::Wish he was on my team.
I AM GILBERT GOTTFRIED::JOHN'S BEEN PLAYING GREAT LATELY I LOVE IT
Victory171::Started betting a system called SportsBettingStar now for a couple of months.  I found this on the first page of Google by looking up Sports Betting Systems.  Since I started, Ive made around $3,000 a month just by following it.
PartTimeHomer::Anyone think the Wizards pay Webster?
Marek7476::Wall with a jumper = Rose
PartTimeHomer::Weird. Having watched them both, it always feels like Rose dunks more than Wall. Maybe he just dunks harder.
I AM GILBERT GOTTFRIED::I THINK HE JUST GETS MORE TIME ON ESPN LOL, WITH GOOD REASON. HOPEFULLY WALL GETS THERE SOME DAY.
PartTimeHomer::Wall with a jumper = Wall with a jumper. Derrick Rose still has a little more nasty in his game than Wall, even though Wall has plenty of attitude. Rose will dunk on dudes for just looking at him wrong, though.
I AM GILBERT GOTTFRIED::DON'T GET ME WRONG, HE'S AN AMAZING FINISHER, UNBELIEVABLE CONTORTIONIST MAGIC, BUT HE'S NOT A PROLIFIC DUNKER AND HE DOESN'T DUNK AS MUCH AS WALL
I AM GILBERT GOTTFRIED::NOPE.  ROSE'S MVP SEASON --&gt; 32 DUNKS, .38 ATTEMPTS PER 36 MINUTES YEAR AFTER THAT, HE HAD LESS THAN 42 DUNKS, WALL HAD 47
PartTimeHomer::I AM GILBERT GOTTFRIED - ROSE DOESN'T DUNK ALL THAT MUCH  Rose dunks a lot more than John Wall does. I'm not calling him Blake Griffin, but he dunks a good deal off of his first step. He may as well have patented the Tomahawk.
I AM GILBERT GOTTFRIED::ROSE DOESN'T DUNK ALL THAT MUCH
266noel::no score in the second half for the new orleans scumbags
GeorgeTownDC29::Come on Hornets dont let us win
joeyxfly::WALL IS UNBELIEVABLE NOW
266noel::two low life teams ....but theyre milionares............   this is america  my home blablabla.
PartTimeHomer::Wow, John.
gt1master_ike::Wall is sodomizing the hornets.
Marek7476::Wall last couple of games = all-star
joeyxfly::wall is playing with unbelievable confidence right now with his shot...
the.city.::he's tryna earn that max contract
joeyxfly::wow wall is shooting the lights out
therachyone::See below convo parttimehomer
PartTimeHomer::lol -- like this board is moving fast enough  Replied to you, though.
fanunknown::wow just 50 comments......that's sad....
fanunknown::Lol me too. Sitting on the clock is awesome
gt1master_ike::Its a wizards hornets thread. You won't get much traffic here. But the Wizards are a team to watch in the future with Wall and Beal.
GeorgeTownDC29::Wiz fans on the Georgetown board
sportinyeah::its Friday though and almost St. Pats day...so its acceptable I guess....I'm only here cuz im at work lol
sportinyeah::<b>wall is bouncing off the wall ladies and gents</b>
sportinyeah::2/10?
PartTimeHomer::2/10
Marek7476::Wall 3 threes made?wtf
Knight13951::Wall 3-3 from downtown :O
PartTimeHomer::Nene's got to have the lowest conversion percentage of layups by centers in the league. Easy And 1.
sportinyeah::<b>John Wall says "yeah I'm going to shoot 3's tonight and drain em all baby!"</b>
lake that swim::lol damn the bookie! -3 wiz cmon baby..
therachyone::Lol @wiz for trading for Ariza and Okafor.
PartTimeHomer::Like I said, can't do much about the contracts right now. The Wizards needed D and that's why those two are here. Past failures and the inability to live up to draft expectations isn't something that falls on the Wizards. That falls on the teams that drafted them or the teams that gave them big contracts. Their prices will come down.  Great D and about 10 points per on the year from both of them (especially Ariza who is 2nd on the depth chart behind a really hot shooting Webster ... another guy who's finding his groove in DC) isn't bad.  Check out the splits on them in the last two months .. or roughly since Wall's been back.  http://espn.go.com/nba/player/splits/_/id/2399/emeka-okafor  http://espn.go.com/nba/player/splits/_/id/2426/trevor-ariza
therachyone::I agree with you about Nene, and no I haven't watched a lot of Wiz ball. I did however watch several years of them with us and that was enough to come to the conclusion that they aren't worth their contracts. Defense only goes so far. A former number 2 pick severely underwhelms and Ariza has phoned in his performances on a consistent basis since obtaining his ring with LA and contract from Houston.
therachyone::Wall is the big part for success, not those 2.  Not worth their contracts.
PartTimeHomer::As someone who actually watches the Wizards, I have no hesitation in telling you that you're wrong. Can't do much about the contracts right now, but they have both been right in the middle of it. Mostly with their defense, but they've both been good surprises on the offensive side when the situation calls for it.  If there's anyone to complain about, it's definitely Nene. Guy can't hit wide open layups.
PartTimeHomer::Why? They've been big parts of the Wizards relatively successful stretch since Wall's been back.
gt1master_ike::Wow Wall has range now?
23germany::you are talking euroleague ?
gt1master_ike::I always felt with his athletic ability he would eventually become a good player. But if he gets a mid range game , its over for the league.
23germany::no. same guy as before, even you could hit 3 in a row from time to time
joeyxfly::this is what us wizards fans have been waiting for...
PartTimeHomer::John Wall's sniping. What the...?
joeyxfly::same...
joeyxfly::WALL FOR 3!!!!
joeyxfly::you can tell now how much wall worked on his 3 proud of him...
