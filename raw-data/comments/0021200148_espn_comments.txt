CoolRod365::New cardiac cats
nba is the worst::Classic ref job game.  Sessions gets 10 fts, Jennings 0,  Bcats 30 ftas,  Bucks 11.  4th Q, Bcats 14, Bucks 2, only 2 in the final minute .  No surprise that the lead ref was one of Stern's old guard, Dick Bavetta (he of 2002 Kings-Lakers game 6 infamy)...
4th_Owns_Lebron::I didn't watch the game, but Monte Ellis does love pull up js and he took 28 shots. Jumpers=/= freethrows.
Aureliux::hahaha you dropped your tin foil hat man! pick it up!

wisconsinsportsrock::I think Esra is still counting his money.. Time to show up!
wisconsinsportsrock::I still can't believe we lost this game? After the 3rd qtr i thought it was a lock...
greysanatomyfreek::Bucks don't have enough firepower to score after Ellis and Jennings once in awhile. Bucks have played the Heat very tough, and will make a good game of it.
Erban Legend::LeBron James &gt; Kemba Walker.
Mizzle85::Lebron James &gt; everybody in the NBA. Dumb a**.
JCollin4::wow, really dude? Thanks for letting us all know that. Your knowledge of the NBA is astounding. I would have never thought for a second that LeBron James was better than Kemba.  Boy, thank god you're here.
Erban Legend::U mad bro
JCollin4::I don't wanna hear about how bad the Bobcats were last year anymore. This is a new year, a different team and a different coach. The Bobcats are decent, people. It's time to accept that.  LET'S GO CATS!
Erban Legend::They are bad bro Heat all day.
Mizzle85::A Heat nutrider in the building huh.
Erban Legend::U jelly bro
JCollin4::Yeah life's good when you have three of the top 15 players in the NBA. You don't understand the small-market struggle BRO where you can't just assemble a dream team.
dre.3oo::Bucks 27 Personal Fouls Bobcats 14 Personal Fouls  Looks like a typical Miami/Boston reffed game...
Erban Legend::LeBron James is going to destroy the Bucks LOL they lost to the Bobcats hahahahahah
Mizzle85::Miami done took a few a** whippings already this year. Undefeated went out the door a long time ago so stop talking like these dudes are invincible.
sduke1986::When Hendo comes back that makes us ever better!  Excited for a great season in Charlotte!
Bandwagon_Bobcats.Fan::Helllllllllllls yeah!!!!!
buttersjohnson9116::Breaking News: If the playoffs started today, the Bobcats would be in the playoffs. The world may end.
nickdemolina::6 seed at that
abbadobad::It's not that shocking. They were in the playoffs three seasons ago.
ChiefsLakersDodgersKingsfan24::bobcats are two wins away from having as many wins as last year.
ireadespn::Michael Jordan finally rubbing off on the cats
GeorgeTownMan29::Bobcats still suck with that front court but Sessions and MKG at least give Kemba some help
ranchkenya::Byron Mullens is a solid player.
81WASIV::FTs 30-11. come on, tell me this sh:t isnt rigged.
dre.3oo::This is how Miami won against Boston too.
Mr. Bradford::Points off turnovers and points in the paint as well.
.New_York_For_The_Win.::Wow the Bobcats are for real this year
cardiac_cats85::Average is a damn good thing this year. Did you see the Bobcats last year? On the up and up
Mr. Bradford::As in for real average.
MyGFStillLikesToPartyAllTheTime::it's not bad to lose to the bobcats anymore, the wizards are the new bobcats
Kyle Packer Fan09::Everybody likes to talk about MKG or Kemba Walker, but what about Byron Mullens? He's playing awesome right now.
nickdemolina::sessions too man that dude is CLUTCH
d_bokk::well, at least we can forget about this game by laughing at how badly the bears are falling apart
IKnowYouReadThis::and to all a good night! now let s all leave the floor to the Bobcats Haters ..peace out
Sportsfan61679::WOW no one saw this coming from the Bobcats, is it the new coach or MKG?
nickdemolina::mike dunlap is a god.
cardiac_cats85::It all starts with Rick Cho
IKnowYouReadThis::no it's all about you!
NCSU Pack Attack::Mike Dunlap and Kemba.
ChiGuy1002::It appears this MIke Dunlap character can coach! He's coaching this roster of mediocres to 5-4! miracle
steelersbobcatsredsox::you calling them a roster of mediocres is quite ignorant, MKG is the real deal, kemba and sessions are legit nba scorers and mullens is playing very well this year, they arent the same team as last year
IKnowYouReadThis::you seriously need to go pass Gas!

FlyGuys623::i wear long sleeve shirts under short sleeve shirts under long sleeve shirts.
KN_WisconsinFan::also the lazy fashion for guys now-a-days
buckspackers23::Makes sense, rpetticrew, because I'M  WHITE! We're like the same person
rpetticrew::buckspackers23 - Are you white and can you shoot the basketball insanely well, but can't do much of the other things in basketball?  Wisconsin fans making fun of white people?
buckspackers23::Same, I can get the rim and hang onto it. But can't dunk. :/
KN_WisconsinFan::yes. well I can ALMOST dunk so that ok
buckspackers23::Are you white and can you shoot the basketball insanely well, but can't do much of the other things in basketball?
KN_WisconsinFan::ya i woulda punched u in the face if you did
buckspackers23::Can't complain about the comfort. I mean I wore them with nice shorts and a flannel the other day. I was debating with myself on the hipster glasses... couldn't pull myself to do it.
KN_WisconsinFan::also we're both 6'3 180+
cb12490::my favorite part about being a bobcats fan is watching the fanbase of every team the bobcats beat melt down after they lose (even though we're above .500 and playing hard and far from the worst team in the NBA)
Bandwagon_Bobcats.Fan::Bobcats just have the stigma b/c of last year. This year's team is much improved, especially with the backcourt shooting and guys that can create for themselves.
FlyGuys623::did anyone else not post the kony posters at random places on 4/20
KN_WisconsinFan::wait what?
FlyGuys623::yes
KN_WisconsinFan::think before you post guys #kony2012

Heat_Master_Sage::I like $@%!$   sorry couldn't help it
KN_WisconsinFan::BOO YA! got him
Phatepiclewts::So mad.
FlyGuys623::i dont like cats. im allergic
KN_WisconsinFan::go screw yourself cats fan
buckspackers23::rpetticrew Sorry- I didn't read your name before asking - seeing you're from Wisconsin, I'm guessing you're probably too drunk by now to answer. Nevermind. ---------------------- What a stereotype. You're the epitome of an abhorrent human being. Anyways, he's still in high school, so that's implausible.
rpetticrew::http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/us/16wisconsin.html?_r=0
rpetticrew::it's their style of play - Dunlap encourages more slashing towards the basket -  Jennings and Ellis are settling for pull ups
rpetticrew::I was hoping there was some sort of reason that idiot sounded so irrational.    If he's sober- that's even worse.
rpetticrew::KN_WisconsinFan - HEY. stop before u post bro  ?
buckspackers23::What's so irrational about looking at the free throw difference and seeing that the Bobcats have 19 more free throws even though the Bucks were in the paint and around the hoop more than the Bobcats?
KN_WisconsinFan::HEY. stop before u post bro
rpetticrew::It's not a stereotype.  It's a fact.  Wisconsin leads the nation in bars per capita.
Heat_Master_Sage::or two birds in a bush?
buckspackers23::I love how people act like nobody ever gets drunk if they're not from Wisconsin or Irish.
KN_WisconsinFan::I'm only 11 what is drunk
KN_WisconsinFan::jk i'm 18 with ADHD that has never been properly diagnosed
Phatepiclewts::NO NOT THE BEES
FlyGuys623::hey little sunny, do you wanna hear the tale of the birds and the bees
