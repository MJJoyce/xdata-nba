TGPhilly919::It's good to see Evan Turner displaying some consistency and scoring chops. Jrue Holiday is an All Star this year, and is developing into one of the game's best point guards, but the Sixers really need Turner to play like a #2 pick. He's starting to get there. Just needs more consistency.
POSTBUSTERSo_O::I liked Holidays "NBA STREETS" dribble off that dudes face
BronCoswaGgg777::Charlotte Squirrels??? No???
Lewade Dwyames....::lol same record as the lakers
Cormag001::Just so everyone knows - Bobcats fans went nuts after that last three because if the Bobcats made a three in the fourth, everyone gets free tickets to the Monday night game...
bobHALO 30.6::Nice... I was wondering why
RZA_CONSOLE::better than big macs
Mr. Bradford::Great discipline in this game. Both teams combined shot a fewer total of free throws (28) than the Thunder's lineup (33) did tonight.
espnrodeostar::Like a brick house
espnrodeostar::Charlotte Cats would be better than Bobcats.
bradyandjrich::Jason Richardson...doing what he does best. My man!
PackerKnutts::One night, Stephen Jackson tried to stay awake, because he was too scared to fall asleep after watching the Blair Witch Project. He tried drinking some Pop with caffeine, but it didn't work. So off he went to Duncan Donuts for some coffee, but there was only one parking spot left. It was on the street, and he wasn't a very good parallel Parker. So Stephen decided to go back home and watch the ManU vs Chelsea game, but he couldn't get the cable to work. He had to Neal down to see what was wrong. He found that his cable Splitter had been chewed through by the dog! He had to rewire it himself, connecting all the wires, including the Green one. But he didn't realize the lines were still hot and shocked himself. He yelled, "Diaw, that hurt!" Then he fell asleep and woke up with a Bonner.

rustyburg::I like this team better with Bynum on the bench then Iggy on the court!
bobHALO 30.6::Its crazy to think but it might be true
-flyers-::Evan Turner and Jrue Holiday future superstars
crankrockk::who needs andrew bynum when we got LAVOY ALLAN BABE, liken that 10pts 10rebs
TCluvcarpanthers::This game would not have been as close if Bynum was playing.
CoreyGallagherArt::Sixers biggest issues are with their physicality in the post and rebounding, Bynum is a player that excels in both of these aspects of the game, I hope that he returns, could be a scary team.
CoreyGallagherArt::Every Atlantic Division team won tonight, boo
76ermixer::JUST HAPPY TO SEE EVAN PLAYING WELL!
jjm2189::Double double for Lavoy Allen.  Just as solid in a Sixers jersey as he was in an Owls jersey. Go Temple.
bobHALO 30.6::Great win for the Sixers.  Love the growth of Jrue and Evan.  Leaps and bounds better in every way than they were last season.
JohnWilkinsonJr::76ers and Bobcats, new NBA policy.  Everyone must play because you never can tell who the fans may have come to see.  I see you each had 3 DNP Coaches decision.  $5,000 fine for every non-starter that doesn't play.  Hadn't heard about the policy?  I just made it up.  $15,000 each please. David Stern
PennDrex::And the All-Star didn't play either, so the Sixers will actually be forfeiting every game until February.
PennDrex::So it looks like we're the last two left FlyGuys...  ::turns lights off::
FlyGuys623::like every other sixers fan, i wish iggy did more for us, but i will always appreciate him for last year http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpje2YSK3ZY
PennDrex::I liked Iggy just fine. He was one of the best perimeter defenders in the league and could score if he needed too.  That contract forced him into a role he wasn't capable of handling though, but the fact that they managed to win a playoff round last year is impressive.  Miss Iggy's game, don't miss that awful contract.
FlyGuys623::mhmm
FlyGuys623::lou with the clutch three to tie the game vs cleveland
PennDrex::This might be blasphemy, but I honestly was happy to see him go.   Would rather him than Nick Young, but I just didn't like Lou's game.
PennDrex::Don't like chuckers and Nick is a chucker.
FlyGuys623::I rather have lou but nick is one of the better replacements in the league. thats just me tho
PennDrex::Since my ability to follow the Sixers is limited (yay terrible KC sports!), anyone have an explanation why Moultrie isn't getting any playing time?
mbarry8::That not the reason.  Collins gave Lavoy Allen and Nic V a ton of minutes last year.  Even Malik Wayne's is gettin some minutes.  Moultrie is in a bad situation: Lavoy, Hawes, Thad and Kwame all  in front of him, with Bynum maybe getting in there as well.  Moultrie'd be. Better off in D league or as part of a throw in on a trade deadline deal..
FlyGuys623::doug collins like every other philly coach (maybe not lavy idk) is stubborn
PennDrex::Well Lavy doesn't have a choice, Homer's cap situation required lots of rookies in the lineup.
potato623::Seeya's tomorrow, get ready for dem Chicago fans...
PennDrex::Take it easy
FlyGuys623::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T35jXN0z2E  iggy
Sh4k4zulu::iggy should of grown a fro = 2nd coming of doc j
FlyGuys623::lol, that would be a sight
picaac15::Great to see Sixers score a lot.  All 5 starters over 10 points and 3 with Double-doubles. The 3-pointers were going in too. The defense wasnt that bad, but interior can use work.  Andrew Bynum anyone?
Sh4k4zulu::use this against laker trolls:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvsVi9W717I
PennDrex::Well the Eagles suck, the Flyers are locked out and the Phillies are trying to throw money at FAs again.  Lets go Sixers?
potato623::Temple is undefeated!
PennDrex::I really want to see Fran win a championship - guy is a legend at Penn.
Mumu8833::Night guys. Sixers by at least 10 tomorrow night!
FlyGuys623::peace
PennDrex::potato623 - I went to the Spurs game last year when Parker smoked us....it sucked, I had a horrible time. I'd rather watch us play a bad team then lose to a good one. ____  Went to the Sixers-Warriors game last year when they handed out the floor from Wilt's 100 point game. That was the most exciting part.  /The Warriors weren't very good
potato623::Ahh I remember that game now, I wanted to go to it haha.
potato623::Was that the game when Ellis destroyed us on ESPN?
PennDrex::That's a negative.
potato623::wAS IT ON nye?
PennDrex::Don't think so, Sixers won handily IIRC
Sh4k4zulu::back with 1 final bit then out lol  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoEJ8qwdxeA  gonna troll bulls fans tomorrow night SO BAD i can't wait  i = so happy
76erfan163::Go Sixers, they are gonna make a championship run(:
76ermixer::YES!!.... no... i wish tho
potato623::Haha, I feel like you are in 6ers prison inmate 163!
Rodney7668::4 of the 5 best teams in the East are in the Atlantic.
vandybo123::Maybe it's because I am a Vanderbilt fan, but does anyone else agree that Jeff Taylor is an extremely solid player
bradyandjrich::Why are you hating on Cutler? Should be proud of him...representing Vandy well.
vandybo123::yeah he's not as big of an $@%. That's true
PennDrex::He's no Jay Cutler.
1173Julius::Solid game 2nite for "ET". Sure he's lookin to go to hiz hometown N sho out 2morrow. Hope da Sixers don't  falter though against a team dat should neva beat them w/o DRose
tank_dogg06::Ironic considering he's from Chicago too.
FlyGuys623::chicago doesnt like evan because he speaks the truth :)
FlyGuys623::the thing that gets me is the hate from chris webber and pretty much every dumba.ss on espn
ajmaster5000::I was so pissed when he called us a bad team.  Who in the hell is he to talk? He's a joke
Mumu8833::ESPN gives sports reporting a bad name and that is saying something
PennDrex::ESPN is pretty much the special olympics when it comes to sports reporting/analysis.
76ermixer::he is sour philly always called him second rate and he never got his championship
PennDrex::Maybe if he didn't play like $@%! when he was here...
potato623::Can't believe he had the balls to call us a bad team...would love to see him show his face here ever again after he stole 20 million from the city
TCluvcarpanthers::The funny thing is the Spurs still almost beat the Heat and put on an entertaining show which strips Stern of his only "logical" argument for fining them except for just fining them for the heck of it.
PennDrex::Yay Sixers!  Are they going to be fined for not playing Bynum?
76ermixer::yes @ Free give us our money back lmao even tho i would keep j rich
Freeholds favorite son::They should fine Lakers and Bucks for selling the Andrews to the warriors and Sixers. Sixers and warriors fans are suffering
never said itd be easy being Philly fan::nawh, worst case, we cleared cap space.  people who only saw iggy's highlites, he wasnt all that.   j-rich and improved young play have covered him easily.
potato623::That's what I was thinking haha, why not fine Cleveland, Washington, Sacarmento, Golden State, Toronoto, Memphis, Detroit, Atlanta, and New Orleans for not playing their "star" players...  Who the hell pays to see Parker and old a## Duncan anyway?
potato623::I went to the Spurs game last year when Parker smoked us....it sucked, I had a horrible time. I'd rather watch us play a bad team then lose to a good one.
Mumu8833::If he were a sixer I would pay to see him every home game
potato623::I love Timmy, but I wouldn't pay to see him.
PennDrex::I wonder if the Spurs can fine the NBA 1M for giving them such a stupid schedule.
Mumu8833::Don't talk $@%! on Duncan
76ermixer::lol nice one
FlyGuys623::Stern likes that thought
FlyGuys623::ughhh. dont like thinking about the nhl
PennDrex::The fact that Bettman is a Stern crony makes so much sense.
Freeholds favorite son::I am a Sixers fan but I have to say nice improvement by the Bobcats
Sh4k4zulu::good night guys and we're gonna have ourselves a blast with bulls fans tomorrow lol!
FlyGuys623::peace
Mumu8833::MJ throwing stuff at DC
RZA_CONSOLE::i like this bobcats team...  find a way to get rid of mullins &amp; get greg monroe  - bam! playoff team
never said itd be easy being Philly fan::was listening to bobcats annoncers on internet, they were building mullins up.  maybe that was bad game, but he didnt show much.
TCluvcarpanthers::Typical inconsistent Mullens game. When his shot is on, he's productive. When it's not, he doesn't show much.
TCluvcarpanthers::To get Monroe, we'd have to give up almost all of our assets.
Freeholds favorite son::Nice win Sixers
FlyGuys623::holy s.hit what an alleyoop. thats what happens when you play the wizards tho (knicks)
76ermixer::good game tonight charlotte is on the rise but cant wait to beat chi town tomorrow maybe then i can stop seeing hundreds of srticles about bynum knees...
76ermixer::lol young kirk is cool but jrue gonna give him hell and if evan keeps playing at a high level we are gonna be a tough team
J webb nation::but how will u stop the great white hope kirk hinrich..
potato623::Sick of ESPN man, they never acknowledge us without Bynum's name, can't they just focus on the current team.
potato623::I write for a Boxing website called Fightsaga.com, I like the SB Nation websites, trying to work my way to going full time there soon.
76ermixer::its a shame too because our team is looking really good already and thats with kwame brown logging real minutes imagine if moultrie or bynum were getting that time
FlyGuys623::agreed. i like a couple of the writers on their, but most of them make me smh
potato623::Haha, I could get a job with the Bleacher Report if I want to, I won't though, they suck.
FlyGuys623::them and every other sports website. bleacherreport goes hard to mention bynum as much as possible
76ermixer::articles
never said itd be easy being Philly fan::new eagles head coach?
76ermixer::you think its reid's fault? or just the injuries and total lack of effort
never said itd be easy being Philly fan::its perfect storm.  turnover prone qb, injured oline, bad play calling, over rated talent (really bad 09-11 drafts except for mccoy in 09) terrible d-coord, poor free agent signing(again bad drafting so chasing players) its a giant mess
never said itd be easy being Philly fan::first things first...see if jeffie has stones to fire reid, believe it when i see it
76ermixer::THE WHO?
potato623::I want some innovation, thus I'm in the Chip Kelly crowd  I want nothing to do with the West Coast offense and the 4-3 Defense
FlyGuys623::im done thinking about them this year
FlyGuys623::and your name is true
Sh4k4zulu::gonna repeat constantly to bulls fans tomorrow night they can keep saying "no rose and no noah" true but plays like these that really killed them:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CbIhm6Cg3c  thank you boozer for helping sixers win last season! love you as a bull player &lt;3
Sh4k4zulu::see ya tomorrow webb good luck!
J webb nation::asik at the ft line... lots of things happened o well. we werent winning it all w/o rose anyway so thanx for putting us our of our misery early.
IggyIsClutch::This is only to phillies fans. Who should we go after?
Mumu8833::Get Vic back if he is substantially cheaper and look for opportunities down the road
JC Frap::Pagan
FlyGuys623::wish they got the wilton lopez dude :(
FlyGuys623::said he had a history but i didnt anything about him currently being hurt
potato623::Supposedly the Phills didn't like what they saw from his physical
FlyGuys623::but i rather have him as our eight inning guy than ba,stardo
IggyIsClutch::Wasn't he injured
potato623::Ahh I'm sick of getting Astros
potato623::Justin Upton
bballdon32::Hamilton
potato623::Ever read his book? I don't read much but that was a good read...interesting dude.
FlyGuys623::im cautious about that move, but i wouldnt be mad if we got him
never said itd be easy being Philly fan::yeah, roll the dice.  and hope
potato623::Seems we are in the minority, I agree
majuub125::Good night and good game.  GO SIXERS!
ericfriedland10::Have a good night. Sixers baby!
FlyGuys623::you too man
