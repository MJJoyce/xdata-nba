kahlua::LMFAO @ OJ Mayo... he must be wondering what the hell he was thinking choosing this over the Dallas Mavericks... I don't care what anyone says, this is one situation where signing for more money is not worth it... imagine how awful the team environment must be knowing management doesn't care...
Amir::Big Al is what Charlotte needed to qualify for Playoff, and they will on weak east.
steve::Why did the Bucks bring in Mayo?  He plays 17 first half minutes with two points.  He doesn't help you in other areas.  If you do not want him to score why bring him in?  #$%$ is Milw. doing?
Michael::Bucks have the worst coach in the league, where is John Henson?????????
Ryan::Henson = DPOY candidate next year if he gets 30min/game
PX::middle of first quarter, I don't need to see the rest. Bucks will lose
Michael::Hey coach, you've lost 11 freaking games in a row, maybe you should finally play your best player, idiot.....
BRM::Hi I don't care about either of these teams but I have Al Jeff in fantasy and she has only played 7 mins. She hurt herself again? Thx in advance.
Phil::Sign big dog
Anton::How much are the tickets for this game? 1 dorrar?
