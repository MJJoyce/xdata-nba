Mr. Nut Job::Spurs are on fire this year.  One of the few teams that seem to have a purpose!
JustinTimeHeHe::LIN RIPPED THE ROCKETS OFF!!  HE SUCKS!!!!  If Douglas plays better defense AND offense than Lin, why not start him???? ITS A SHAME,when the rockets hafto replace there starting pg for DOUGLAS HAHAHAHAHHA
emthomasjr::100% chance Lin is an AllStar
JustinTimeHeHe::I know. It will make the entire league look like a joke seeing him miss shot after shot in a game where there is no defense
JustinTimeHeHe::And watch Lin becomes an all-star this year HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHA OMG~!!!!!
nba is the worst::Just another routine 4Q win.  Spurs just rolling along...
john1schn::David Stern is cowering in his office screaming at his voodoo doll of Popovich.
NguyenDragon::He apparently hates all teams from Texas... Damn thug...
machomet25::Lin had the most rebounds on the team and the best  +/-.    HATERS
JustinTimeHeHe::lol haters?
JustinTimeHeHe::Seriously what is that supposed to even mean? Hes not a rebounder moron so he obviously just got lucky. I doubt very much they start him at PG to rebound. Hes 6'2 lmao, stick to baseball. By the way, I dont think we are haters, I think we know basketball better than most of you who like him for his smarts. If you wanna cuddle with him thats fine, but dont call people haters for talking sports and knowing sports
JustinTimeHeHe::Hahahahha WOW Lin does suck. Toney Douiglas should be starting man, he grabbing more points in less mins on an average now
choa25::man are we surprised, Those who knew bball and wasnt from Asia and just learned bball a year ago knew Linn was at best a bench player, physically and athletically the boy he cant compete as a starter.....
JustinTimeHeHe::Exactly but still, we must be racist to say so
JustinTimeHeHe::Lin $@%!$@% sucks now shutup
DaPhillies::Is lin even shooting 30% this season?
JustinTimeHeHe::Na
utexasfan1::Lin = fail
choa25::Hey stanley whatever hes not taking a college math exam Dumbaxx sometime you have to live in Reality and get yr fat/slope head out of the video life Lin cant play on hype all his career he sure fooled the Rockets in that Big Contract this summer tho, im sure they will have buyers remorse by the time the playoffs come around....
NguyenDragon::He cant play with Harden but he can definitely play...
Stanley5826::Fail in Maths SAT? He got perfect scores, in case u don't know. I bet your a$$ u couldnt score that. Lin's real smart and playing in the NBA. Thats why hes getting so much hate. U Fail !!!!!
JustinTimeHeHe::He still sucks at basketball, i think thats what this is about you fool
LakersAtSonics1995::K
flip tide.....::Lin finished with four points, four assists and two turnovers.  LinSanity meets Prozac
eQ2.1::J Lin... I kind of wanted him and Harden to become the big 1-2 punch for HOU, but to be honest J Lin doesn't seem good enough or he is good enough but mentally too weak.
flip tide.....::nah, he's mentally tough  - just not good enough to fight past a scouting report, i.e. If the other team takes special note of him he cannot rise above it.
No-account drifter::No, meaning he just doesn't have the chops.
SBaller74::Meaning he is mentally weak
WesTexSpur::McHale-"You guys need to pass it to Lin more".....Harden-"Who is that??"
choa25::A nice kid like you who needs to learn more english before u come onto a Grown Mans board lol....
Dondi716::ok got it stanley5826 it's been nice blogging with you keep your head up !!!!
Stanley5826::Same here but pls try not to hate on the nice kid. He's just something special. A kind of like a God's gift. Exaggerating a bit.
Stanley5826::Difference? Me being a rational Lin fan.  I'm not gonna say like he's an elite pg. Of something like he's the next MJ. That's the difference. And I'm not gonna make an excuse like blaming harden or asik. But to be fair, Asik didn't great too. Why does he get a pass. I know he went up against Duncan.  Lin played against Parker in case u forgot.
Dondi716::and there's a difference?
Dondi716::Watch out or Stanley's gonna get you!!!
Stanley5826::I won't cos he's not hating. I'm not a delusional Lin fan.  I'm a rational Lin fan
pismohoops::Does Lin still think of himself as an allstar???
zachrlee::Another 4-point performance by Lin. Seems to be the norm these days. He was just too proud to be tutored by Jason Kidd. Now, he's realizing that his skills aren't really up-to-scratch. Still can't shoot, still can't go left, still reckless with the ball, still reading too much internet commentaries about him. Lin reads everything from the internet. That's his problem. It's better if he keeps his head down and work on changing that stupid-looking jumpshot.
Stanley5826::It's all good. I'm cool. Good on you. And I wish  your team all the best. The way your playing, u guys can go all the way.
Dondi716::So then maybe were in agreement that lins a nice guy and I really do wish him all the best and I apologize on the tone of my post:) -----------------:&gt;)NOT
Stanley5826::I'm perfectly normal if that's what u wanna know.  Theres no need to shout, your blood pressure will shoot up and u need to call 911.  Enjoy your pathetic life and pls dont hate on the nice kid JLin. Take it out on the delusional Lin fans if u want. But pls dun hate on him,
Dondi716::DUDE SIT BACK AND TAKE YOUR RITALIN----&gt; AND DON'T MIX IT WITH ALCOHOL PLEASE, AND READING YOUR POST U MAY WANT TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL ABOUT MULTIPLE   PERSONALITY DISORDER:)
Stanley5826::I bet all u haters are just envious and jealous of JLin. It's not his fault the media hyped him. He's just a regular nice kid who fulfilled his dreams of playing in NBA. He didn't say he's the best of out there. He's trying his best but obviously he's not playing good now. But u guys are just pathetic hoping him to fail. How can u know he's a bust. Just give him a full season to judge.
Dondi716::WOW you went all the way back!!! and Bruce Boclair  hope i got the name correct ? however your on point. Houston fans should point their anger at the houston managment clearly this was a move to fill seats and sell basketball related products. A young Point guard with no veterans to help guide this guy with 26 games in the league well is just plain stupid good luck Jeremy Lin wish you were still at the Garden training and working on your SKILLS @GO KNICKS
Stanley5826::And for the record, I don't go to your blogs and talk $hit. I hope u haters get a life. And that goes for some of the delusional Lin fans.
Stanley5826::U wished JLin still in NY to play with a selfish ballhog Melo? Yea right. Why the hell r u here trolling, posting your stupid comments about another team's player. Go back to your hole and kiss your hero's a$$. I bet your a Melo lover too hating on JLin.
giofls6871::I got breaking news for you -- Jeremy Lin isn't that good, and certainly not worth the money the Rockets paid for him.  I think he could be a good first-guard-off-the-bench, because he plays with a lot of energy.  If he's making his shots, leave him out there for a while and let him score 12-15 points.  If not, sit him back down and try him again the next time the team's energy level wanes.  I warned everyone last year that Jeremy Lin is the new Mike Vail (look him up, Mets mid-70's).  His pan has no more flashes in it.  Thanks to Houston for taking him off our hands
palsy360::I no the Knicks r glad they didn't match that ridiculous contract
Stanley5826::I bet your a knick fan. GTFO. Enjoy your wins while it last. You'll never get past 1st round anyway, that's only if u get there.
Dondi716::you sound really angry calling names and posting ridiculous predictions/so keeping with your theme houstons a lottery team and I'm sure there are concerns about Jlin and that ridiculous contract too much pressure to live up to the linsanity of it all so in closing I feel for you I really do. PS LOL;):(:):(:):(
Stanley5826::'tutored by Kidd? NY didnt offered a contract. U ignorant troll. Crawl back to your Knicks blog and enjoy your win vs leflop
LeoA86::Spurs will just own the rockets all year long. Period. Lin sucks after all and the rockets will regret picking him up again, and will drop him again for the second time.lol The spurs are a quality team. With a real second squad. or Team for that matter. :D
rhm4jc::Again, Rockets simply can not shoot the ball from outside.  When FG % is less than 40%, and opponents over 50%, chances are you'll lose every time.  Lin needs to work on his shot cause he's been horrible.
future_bassmaster::The Knicks were obviously going to offer JLin a  four year contract so please spare us the 'they just dropped him' act. I guess you forgot that Lin decided to have a secret mid-week meeting with the Rockets, and got them to up their original offer so he could squeeze more money out of the Knicks. Well, he didn't take into account that when he increased his salary amount it pushed the Knicks well over the luxury tax, which would have costs the Knicks an additional $35M on top of the $25M salary. Meaning they were paying $60M for Lin. Do you think he's worth that? The Rockets knew the Knicks weren't going to match that once Lin signed the contract.
Dondi716::I do know this and weren't for that mid week meeting he may still be a Knick,your Question is He (Lin) worth 60 million. Answer few players are worth their contracts but he (LIN) had box office appeal.
Dondi716::I know this but couldn't help myself lol:):):(:(:)-----------------------&gt; and while I'm in a thankful mood I would also like to give a BIG SHOUT OF THANKS TO THE TORONTO RAPTOR'S for taking a even bigger bag of garbage AKA----------&gt; Landry Fields for around 19 million for 3 years and again Thanks---------------------- Knick's fan's around the globe.
Dondi716::thank you Daryl Morey for taking this faux point guard off our hands and paying top dollor &gt; ------------------yours truly Knick's Managment
flip tide.....::Actually, Lin was not taken off ANYONES hands since he was a free agent WHO DID NOT EVEN GET AN OFFER FROM HIS OLD TEAM.  A better analogy would be: "thanks for taking our sloppy seconds!"
rckstarkid79::if harden ball hogged it so much why did he lead the team in assists tonight?? he was a great thunder teammate hes just making the most of his chance of being a starter, wish my thunder coulda kept him and put him in the starting line uo instead of thabo
sports guy12::dang. I was hoping Poppovich would rest a few starters, then Spurs and Rockets on even playing ground
john1schn::only if Pop played his cheerleaders.
YaImFromCleveland::So many Lin haters lol, no one said anything when he handed it to felton during the Knicks games
FoxKat93::5856Rach I support Lin because he survives ridiculous harsh criticism that no player in the NBA history has ever experienced...day in and day out.    "Flash in the pan, undeserving, airball, he is a joke,Kobe's stare and saying he is a little man, he is Romney, Felton is better than him, Knicks jersey sells better without him, his contract is ridiculous, Stephen A Smith said XX&amp;@? about him................"    Maybe Linsanity and the Houston's contract are not good for him, he tried very hard to fit in and has done a good job so far. I will support him for his spirits and efforts. Go...Lin  ======= What are you talking about? I can't stand LBJ as a player, but he undoubtedly gets the worst and harshest criticisms of active players. Next would be Westbrook. By default, since Lin isn't even receiving as much or as harsh criticism how can he have the most criticism in history of the NBA???  The truth of the matter is that Lin fans get upset at the smallest criticism as treat it with more attention than it should be given. I find this stance to be hypocritical because he can receive all of the positive attention that a superstar receives, but not that negative as well. Along with Harden, Lin is the face of the team--there is a reason why he gets so much attention.
Mott the Hoop::Everyone was ripping on Felton when he wasn't balling two weeks ago. Man, take it easy. It's about body of work for the year. Not one game.
palsy360::All of those comments r true fox
LeoA86::Dude, Raymon Felton is balling right know. Lin. is a joke.
NoonGame::asik no points and lin 2-9 for 4 points is the main  problem why they lost and not race, hate or anything else...
Tuoi56::Lin is shooting far less than when he did in NY and dribbles to the basket far less than when he was in NY.
palsy360::He's scarf of getting hurt
flip tide.....::no, dummy - read NoonGame's post again or have your mom explain it to you
NoonGame::defenders are adjusting to his game...
Hank10593::Lin played 26 minutes and with best +/- of the starting line up. Of course he is the problem. Fu.cking haters don't even watch the game and make comments to show that they are nothing more than bunch of jealous whites and blacks who envy an Asian's success.
Dondi716::I fell sorry for you . You look but don't see. This is sports entertainment.Why would blacks @ whites, Be jealous of Asian success answer me this WHY?
KeriTheCreoleTexan::lol You're so blind, it's sad.
FoxKat93::lol. Yes, the only reason fans dislikes Lin is because of his race...NOT.
mbsmith_101::Jeremy Lin is not the problem.  Jeremy Lin's 6 rebounds leading the team is the problem.
cfylong::Lins a good player.  He'exciting to watch.  He'll get better as time goes.  He' s outplayed several good guards including Felton n Lowry, so fans just have to be patient.  He' s a trailblazer,so he' gonna get hate, just like Jackie Robinson.  Good thing he' s got class just like jr, not like the cockroaches that come out when it's safe.
Tuoi56::Harden's ball hog can not beat Spur's fundamental ball movements. Spurs are superior.
NoonGame::because of his ability to create his own shots and get to the basket...he score 29
NoonGame::trust me harden is not the problem...asik scores no point and lin score 4 points 2-9 22%
Tuoi56::Harden is the problem when he becomes the PG. and there is no ball movement within the Houston Rockets.
NoonGame::he has been going to the basket but no change.
Tuoi56::He hasn't gone to the basket like he did NY. far less in Houston. period.   Lin is PG. he can easily drive to the basket and average 15pts a night. but Harden is doing it all.
NoonGame::I like lin too but he's in a bad shooting slump or cant shoot...
Tuoi56::Lin is in a shooting slump right now. I see it on TV.   What Lin should do is drive to the basket more and score that way he can build up the confidence. And he's shooting will then follow.   that's the way to bring his confidence back. by scoring points.
Tuoi56::Do you not see Lin dribbling up the court and passing it to Harden and then waving to pass him the ball but not getting it on TV.  or are your eyes seeing the different things????
YaImFromCleveland::lol i see that even in the highlights
Tuoi56::Do you not see Harden  ball hogging, and shooting 90% of the time or are my eyes different from yours????
NoonGame::he's the star on that team...
NoonGame::to be honest...without him the rockets would have been alot worse.
Somedood1::No.......... ever heard anyone say one man can't take on a whole team?
rEdBuLxTaSy::ALRITE I'M OUT TO THE WIFEY...AS USUAL HATERS GONA HATE NO MATTER WHAT SO IT'S ALL GOOD.  IT'S JUST A GAME! :):):)  P.S. I'M PROBABLY ONE OF THE REALIST MUTHAFUKA OUT THERE SO PEACE!!!
New Orleans Voodoo Child::That's a passionate guy.
mdupnic09::any game that bonner gets to dunk...greatest game EVER
LeoA86::Dude, Seriously! Omfg! I litteraly sharted! :D
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::I don't understand how the Rockets are managing this back court. If you get a player like Lin shouldn't he handle the ball?
dannylko1.3::You haters are pathetic.  You people only show up for his bad games to troll.  All of you vanish when he has good games faster than a drug deal gone bad.  Lin somehow receives all the blame for every loss (see Asik btw) and somehow he's the only young player in history that won't improve.  Gee I wonder why...
Stanley5826::Yea, the haters will flood here with all their hate comments, especially 'Justin Bieber boy'.
largehrdsports20::A couple of hypocrites who used to troll the Knicks blog when they thought letting Lin walk was a mistake for NY. But now the Knicks are flourishing and Lin is faltering and Lin-devotees are butt hurt. Lovely.
rEdBuLxTaSy::HAHAHA IT'S JUST A GAME MAN...ALRITE LET'S JUST ALL RELAX AND ENJOY THE GAME :):):)
largehrdsports20::Technically he's a 3rd year man. And comeuppance is a b/tch! We Knicks fan endured from Aug to Nov. and again when the Rockets beat us. Now it's the Lin-devotees turn. I'm out. You get the last word here. <b>Go Knicks<b></b></b>
rEdBuLxTaSy::THIS IS LIN'S FIRST FULL SEASON AS A STARTER SO HE'S TECHNICALLY A ROOKIE.  THE TROLLING ON MY PART WERE IN RESPONSE TO THE CONSTANT BASHING BY BITTER KNICKS FANS WHOM WERE TRYING TO JUSTIFY LETTING LIN WALK.   NOT THAT I CARE IF LIN STAY IN NY OR NOT BUT THE HATING WAS UNCALL FOR ESPECIALLY WHEN LIN HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT NY.  NOT THAT TWO WRONGS MAKE IT RIGHT BUT SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THE HATERS SEE IS BY GIVING THEM THEIR OWN DOSE OF MEDICINE.
largehrdsports20::That's what you were doing when you were trolling; comparing age and experience? Nah, you were just certain that the Knicks had messed up letting Lin walk. And the dude been in and out of the league since 2010 for a reason. He not a rookie.
rEdBuLxTaSy::BUTT HURT?  DEFINITELY NOT!!!  JUST PAINTING THE TROLLS FOR WHAT THEY ARE...TRYING TO DOWNPLAY A ROOKIE BY COMPARING HIM TO VETERANS, WHICH IS INSIGNIFICANT AND IRRELEVANT AT THIS POINT.
rEdBuLxTaSy::MOST OBSESSED HATERS DOESN'T BELIEVED IN HOPE AND DREAMS...THEY ALL THINK THE WORLD IS FLAT.  :):):)
wristedhip::Good bye Mr. Harden. Spend your money well.
johnnyx2011::Lakers hired Dantoni so they can later trade for Lin. Once traded to the Lakers, Lin will adjust his contract and learn from the great Nash. Come on now, Lakers are preparing for the future already.
mdupnic09::preparing for the future? hahaha how? by signing an ancient point guard and a center that could leave next year? name one good young player the lakers have for the future
dannylko1.3::not sure about that
5856Rach::That is just talk.  Don't know how long Dantoni can keep his job.
rEdBuLxTaSy::JACKIE ROBINSON MUST BE ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE :):):)  "DAM.N NIKKAS HATING ON A BROTHA!!!"  ~~ JACKIE :):):)
5856Rach::I am sure that Lin maybe endure some threats,too...from haters...but he will never tell you.    Lin is always thankful for all the supporters. That is a positive attitude and a proper way to handle it.
largehrdsports20::"Linsanity" The guy was a rockstar briefly. Of course, he'll attract some crazies but they aren't threatening him because he's Asian.
largehrdsports20::Race trolling: The last refuge of a complete dumb@$$.
largehrdsports20::There's a saying from a blues artist: If you're white you're all right. Despite being the so-called "model minority" I know there's an anti-Asian sentiment that exist. But you can't compare Lin's playing basketball with Jack Robinson's civil rights' accomplishment.
rEdBuLxTaSy::I GOT THE POINT...THE RACIAL TENSION WAS AT IT'S PEAK THEN BUT YOU CAN'T DENY THE RACIAL OVERTONE HASN'T CHANGE MUCH SINCE.  THE REALITY IS IF LIN WAS BLACK, HIS POOR PERFORMANCES WOULDN'T EVEN BE EXPLOITED THE WAY IT HAS BEEN AND HIS GOOD PERFORMANCES WOULD HAVE BEEN CREDITED.
largehrdsports20::Robinson was striking a blow for civil rights and racial equality. It wasn't about his batting avg. Lin is just another Asian playing pro-ball like Yi. You're in way over your education level if you think Robinson joined the Dodgers solely to hit the ball nad run bases.
rEdBuLxTaSy::CONSIDER IT WHAT YOU WANT...JR HAD 10 YEARS TO ACHIEVED HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  LIN JUST STARTED AND THE NBA IS BUSINESS AS USUAL SO YOUR ARGUMENT LACKS ANY MERIT.  THERE'S A SAYING DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS UNTIL THEY HATCH.
largehrdsports20::Robinson's accomplishment was heroic. What Lin is doing is just business, and he's doing it poorly, by the way.
rEdBuLxTaSy::THANK GOD THIS ISN'T THE 40S OR 50S...HELLOOO THIS IS 2012!!!  YEA YOU'RE SO SHALLOW AND CLUELESS.  NOW THE HATE ARE JUST MOSTLY VERBAL SINCE HATE CRIME IS A FELONY :):):)
largehrdsports20::Ok so you're ignorant. Lin doesn't endure death threats or have to worry about lodging or whether or not a restaurant will serve him. Lin is no trailblazer. He's risking nothing, unlike Robison did.
rEdBuLxTaSy::FIRST OR NOT IS "NOT" THE POINT.  THE TREATMENT IS STILL THE SAME.  HOW'S THAT FOR AN ILL-INFORMED TROLL?
largehrdsports20::Nah, Jackie was good. And Lin's struggle doesn't even come close. Lin is not the first Asian to play in the NBA. An Asian was the first nonwhite to play in the NBA be in the 40s or 50s. You're race troll or just ignorant or both.
rEdBuLxTaSy::HOW IS IT RACE TROLLING WHEN IT'S THE TRUTH? JR BEEN THROUGH THE SAME TREATMENT...IT'S A SHAME!
largehrdsports20::Lin is the biggest disappointment in Rockets history. Right now Royce White is having a better season than Lin.
Somedood1::Knicks fans butthurt much? Who won? Houston or NY.. hmmmmmm
largehrdsports20::What's wrong, red? You gonna cry? Your idol is a false one. The Knicks with Felton at the PG are real contenders. Sux to be a Lin-devotee right now.
rEdBuLxTaSy::HAHAHA WAS THAT A REAL RETORT?  SERIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY COMICAL SENSE AT ALL :):):)
largehrdsports20::It's impossible to understand the mumblings of an unlettered, ill-literate Lin-devotee.
rEdBuLxTaSy::AW YOU DIDN'T GET THE POINT...THE KNICKS ARE A VETERAN GROUP SO YOU'RE IRRELEVANT AS USUAL :):):)
largehrdsports20::14-4 vs 9-9. That's my point.
rEdBuLxTaSy::WHAT'S WRONG OBSESSED LIN HATER?  THE ROCKETS ARE YOUNG AND REBUILDING.  THE KNICKS ARE AGING AND GASSY.  WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
rEdBuLxTaSy::HEY YOU MUST BE KNICKERBUTT, BISHEEP, JUSTINBEIBER, ETC??? :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::STILL TROLLING...KEEP IT UP LOL :):):)
howbouthemspurs::how bout we talk more on how awesome Tony Parker and Nando De Colo are and less on how bad Lin really is. .. We know already.
KobeTimeFourth::Nobody mentioned Asik's stat line tonight lol, just focus on Lin.  My black brothers hate successful asians.
5856Rach::Are they special?
rEdBuLxTaSy::TOO BAD NOBODY CAN'T GET OFF LIN'S NUTS...THAT SPEAKS VOLUME ABOUT THE KID :):):)
5856Rach::I support Lin because he survives ridiculous  harsh criticism that  no player in the NBA history has ever experienced...day in and day out.  "Flash in the pan, undeserving, airball, he is a joke,Kobe's stare and saying he is a little man,  he is Romney, Felton is better than him, Knicks jersey sells better without him, his contract is ridiculous, Stephen A Smith said XX&amp;@? about him................"  Maybe Linsanity and the Houston's contract are not  good  for him, he tried very hard to fit in and has done a good job so far.  I will support him for his spirits and efforts. Go...Lin !
whoseyourdaddy60::uh? see kwame brown. im sure he has some nice stories about harsh criticism,
NewcastleFanVL::Ppl are writing him off far too early and I'm patiently waiting for his stretch of impressive performances.
Tuoi56::Houston should beat Mavericks even with Harden ball hogging and shooting and driving to the basket by himself all the time.
Cardinals-Diamondbacks-Sun Devils-Suns::As many of you know,I have posted the message"Spurs fans suck." many times. So why do I hate the Spurs? Because my Phoenix Suns got SCREWED in 2007. That Amare suspension was totally unfair and unwarranted and it cost the Suns the heyy game of that series,game 5. It was totally unfair and unwarranted and it may well have cost the Suns the 2007 NBA Championship. After 2007,being a Suns fan gives me no choice but to hate the Spurs.
HookemHorns1957::Get over it already....you lost.  And the Spurs still have 4 rings more than the Suns ever will.
TrueTexasFan23::As a Spurs fan who went to Arizona State I can confirm that the entire city is like this...they absolutely hate anything to do with the team.  I do like Harden though, being a Sun Devil and all...
whoseyourdaddy60::yea, cause the suns would of won? no.
MontanaAggie::Robert Horry.  My hero.
rEdBuLxTaSy::WHY DID THEY SUSPEND AMARE?
mdupnic09::because he broke the rules and left them no choice
CINCSTAR::I agree they got screwed, but wasn't that more on Stern? The Spurs had no say inteh decision to suspend Amare or Boris.
mdupnic09::hahahaha, that is all
Tuoi56::with Harden ball hogging, Lin will not flourish in this team. I hope Lin trades to Lakers and play for D'antoni. great pick and roll man.
OoOballing::Can't you guys see that there is more than one system the Rockets is employing here. Both Lin and Harden can play the play maker role, and everyone knows where they are suppose to be on the court, but not how to get there and create movement in the process to the defending difficult. It is so easy to defend when all the guys are parking at their position waiting for things to happen.
CJ From San Andreas ESPN Mods Are Idiots::Are you serious? Stop with this Lin nonsense. He's a bad role player and 2 years from now he probably won't even be in the NBA anymore.
rEdBuLxTaSy::ARE YOU TELLING ME IF YOU'RE A RAPPER AND SOMEONE WANTS YOU TO SING COUNTRY, YOU'RE GONA WIN A GRAMMY?  HAHAHA DAM.N JOKER :):):)
largehrdsports20::No one will take on his contract against his poor play. He's a future D-Leaguer or C-Leaguer.
Tuoi56::how many times Lin shoots with the Harden shooting all the time? you counted??? I did.
Tuoi56::bull sh it. you wish.  he can average 15pts a night with the right system. right now he's not shooting much and not being utilized right way.
NewcastleFanVL::I'M NOT SURE LIN'S GOODY2, DIE HARD TEAM 1ST ATTITUDE WILL EVER PAY OFF FOR HIM OR HIS TEAM.
largehrdsports20::Redbul is seriously, emotionally, butt hurt. He used to come to the Knicks blog all the time clowing Dolan and Melo. Now the records speak for themselves. One team is in championship contention and the another is heading toward a  long summer vacation.
rEdBuLxTaSy::HAHAHA KNICKS TROLLS ARE THE "ORIGINAL" TROLLS ON ESPN.  DON'T HATE THE PLAYER, HATE THE GAME. :):):)
TRIPPIN76::Rockets fans it isn't Lin or anyone in the roster. It's the SPURS D!
Tuoi56::Right now Lin's hot is off. He's not making the shot he should.   In that case, drive to the basket and shoot more and create fould like he did with NY. He will get his confidence back.
CJ From San Andreas ESPN Mods Are Idiots::lol Lin is terrible
Tuoi56::no he's not. Houston is not utilizing the right way. Houston fuc king sucks. they have no ball movement.   Lin's got great passing skills. let him be the PG and create plays.
kita2porgee::LIN MUST BE BENCH IF HE IS NOT GOING TO SHOOT. IF CHRIS PAUL CAN NOT TURN IT ON AND OFF AS FAR AS SHOOTING IT, WHO THE HECK ARE YOU LIN? YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST THINK, "OK I WILL SHOOT THE BALL NOW." YOU IDIOT LIN, YOU MUST BE IN TUNE THE WHOLE GAME. ASIANS LIKE ME WATCH YOU GET INSULTED LEFT AND RIGHT FROM THE LIKES OF SEAN ELLIOT WHO SPENT 5 MINUTES MAKING FUN OF YOU. YOU LIN, DO NOT REPRESENT US ASIANS LIKE PAQUIAO OR BRUCE LEE. YOU ARE SHOWING US ASIANS AS COWARD, GO RETIRE NOW, YOU EMBARASSED US ASIANS ENOUGH. CHICKEN !!
rEdBuLxTaSy::SLOW DOWN KIDDY, LIN'S' PLAYING POORLY OFFENSIVELY BUT HE'S ALSO NOT BE UTILIZED PROPERLY EITHER.
largehrdsports20::Bruce Lee wasn't real. He was an invention of the movies. Chuck Norris would've destroyed him.
Kit Ramsey::Fail.
rEdBuLxTaSy::I BET YOU WOULD GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES IN FRONT OF BRUCE IN REAL LIFE SO PLEASE STOP BEATING THE BAG!
largehrdsports20::Nah, Chuck just has a real, verifiable record of whupping @$$. Unlike, Mr. Lee.
rEdBuLxTaSy::GEE CHUCK WAS YOUR IDOL?  HAHAHA :):):)
Tuoi56::are your eyes seeing the different things on TV?? I see Harden ball hogging 90% of the time and Lin waiting for the pass but  never getting it.  are my eyes lying???
peakarach::Agree. Harden taking way to many shoot.
kita2porgee::START GREG SMITH, NOT ASIK, THAT OVER RATED SLOW, CAN'T SHOOT, CAN'T LAY UP, PASSING THE BALL TO THE WRONG TEAM OR EVEN TIPPING THE BALL IN FOR THE OPPONENTS. START DEL FINO. START DOUGLAS IF SISSY LIN WON'T BE ASSERTIVE OR SENT HIM TO D'LEAUGE, HARDEN, YOU GREEDY IDIOT, WHEN THERE'S 6 PLAYERS GUARDING YOU, YEAH THAT INCLUDES THE WATER BOY, PASS THE BALL!! WHERE IN THE WORLD IS McHALE? PLAYERS WHO BEAT THE LAKERS, SMITH, DEL FINO, DOUGLAS, PLAYED MINIMAL!!
Tuoi56::LIn averaged 25pts in NY = because he drove to the basket and shot more.  Lin averages 10pts in Houston = because he dribbles up the court and passes to Harden and after that his team mates don't pass the ball to him. and when he rarely gets the ball, he's not making the shot right now.  Lin, if you are not making the shot, then drive to the basket more and create foul shot. like you did in NY.
largehrdsports20::MDA. Period. His PG centered system helped Lin greatly.
largehrdsports20::MDA's system makes average PG look good and good ones look great. Lin benefited from it. And Lin should be this team 3rd leading scorer at best. He's the PG. The only time he should lead the team in score is when the scores are struggling. But Houston is just one big struggle, anyway.
Tuoi56::am I lying? or are your eyes seeing different things on TV. do you not see Harden ball hogging 90% of the time? and Lin waiting for the pass but never getting it?  who's the PG in Houston? Harden?
Tuoi56::stupid comment? dude it's the fact. what you talking about bro? the answer is right there for Lin's stats to go up/
RNYC::No man. Lin has no confidence. That has to be fixed first b4 all of this nonsense and blame game stuff u keep spewing.
RNYC::U must have programmed some "repeat same stupid comment" algorithm that works on this board.
largehrdsports20::How long before you guys start blaming Toney Douglas for playing better than Lin? I say it happens before the Jan 1st.
rEdBuLxTaSy::ANOTHER TYPICAL HATER GRASPING FOR STRAWS, WITH LITTLE OR NO MERITS.
kita2porgee::LIN SHOULD BE PAID $800K, AND THAT IS EVEN TOO MUCH FOR HIS CHICKEN, PASSIVE, NON-AGRESSIVE, NON-COMPETITIVE= NO PRODUCTION.  I SAY AGAIN, AN EMPLOYEE MUST PERFORM FOR WHAT HE IS PAID FOR. AND EMPLOYER MUST PAY EMPLOYEE FAIRLY. THIS IS IN THE BIBLE, LIN. SO FAR YOUR EMPLOYER IS NOT GETTING A FAIR SHARE FOR BEING SISSY, CHICKEN, NON-PERFORMING OVER-PAID CONTRACTOR. FROM ONE ASIAN TO ANOTHER, I AM DISGUSTED " WHEN YOU ARE AN IDIOT W/ TALENT THAT SUPPOSEDLY REPRESENTING US!!" YOU ARE NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE IN THE NBA. WE SUPPORTED YOU ENOUGH !! I HOPE THEY BENCH YOUR YELLOW-BACK $@% AND SEND TO D-LEAUGE!
Tuoi56::the problem is Harden ball hogging too much and his team mates not passing to him and not creating a ball movement.   and he's not driving to the basket like he did in NY.
peakarach::Agree. In order for Rockets to win more games,Harden need to stop asking the ball all the time.
largehrdsports20::Lin is shooting poorly and Harden has nothing to do with it. Lin has to take the shots he can and make them. Harden and Chandler should be the teams high scorers and Lin should be the teams assist man. But he's not.
largehrdsports20::The Rockets played themselves when they offered Lin the contract. They tried to burn the Knicks but got burned.
