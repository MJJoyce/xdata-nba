mdtuzo::would have been here yesterday but i was cheering for the giants
insanedane8::I like how the ESPNNY headlines for this story is "Nets score rare win, dump Cats", when the Nets are 3-3 over their last six games. The Knicks are 0-6 over that period.
PortlandBlazers1004::Long before LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh made it fashionable through free agency, the Trail Blazers created a Big Three the old-fashioned way: home grown. They pulled Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge from the 2006 Draft and took Greg Oden the following year. Seemingly the pieces for a future championship run were in place. One was a scoring guard, the other a double-double power forward and the third a center with a tendency to rebound and defend. Pretty much everything was covered. The Young Three was diverse in talent, filled important roles and had room for growth and greatness. And yet, almost five years later, the Big Three is reduced to a Big One-Third after having that group literally sliced apart by a surgeon's scalpel.
ChicagoSportsFan2301::AND???????????????????????????? What is the point of this. Whole bunch of talking without any purpose
thatlookseasy::1- why are you posting this on here? 2- Aldridge wasnt really a double double guy back then, he was known as a pretty poor rebounder for his size 3- Thats why you always draft the best player available over drafting for need. Oden over Durant was stupid, not because Oden was a bad pick, but because Durant was always better
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::Why does the EAST suck so bad compared to the WEST???
Mcatee1117::Send one of your teams out here to the United Center in Chicago and lets re-evaluate that statement.
DeWayne5783::We better get Sullinger, Jordan don't $@%! it up
LakerSince90::http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1021224-lob-city-clippers-wont-live-up-to-lofty-expectations
smon260::As a die hard Nets fan I want to get D Howard so bad! I just hate that MarShon Brooks has played so well that he has to be included in the trade.  MarShon is special and Brooklyn will never see it live.  D-Will and DH12 will be great but Brooks would help them win a tittle for sure.  Sucks he has to go,,,
smon260::LMAO... Watch a Nets game before you make stupid comments
smon260::Otis, you are very silly
Otis Smith...::Have you seen how many shooting Guards the Magic have
smon260::I pray that the Magic would take anyone else not named D-Will
smon260::everyone knows the MarShon, Lopez, draft pix trade is coming.... I will miss Brooks
KiNgJr4ReAl::MarShon Brooks please as if the magic want him hes no better than Evan Turner
kyle williams is my hero::who cares, did you see the G-Men?
PresleyCutchTabata::D-Will finally decides to step up and the Nets win? you gotta be kidding me!
DaBostonStrangler10::Haha only 167 posts
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::haha Come on Bro...The celtics don't suck! Better than your sorry team
thatlookseasy::Have you seen the Celtics lately?
metsrule1296::haha boston celtics suck!
Metropolitans Est.1962::Well at least there are still a couple of teams worse than we are in the Association !!! LETS GO NETS!!
Christopher2833::I can see it now, The bobcats finish with the worst record in the league, and get the 15th pick in the draft. and pick a guy who will be a bust.
Christopher2833::Of course they probably will end up with the first pick , and draft a bust anyway, They need a mega superstar to put butts in the seats, who wants to go see Diaw, Henderson, Matt Caroll, the list goes on.
sinatrascue::nets &gt; knicks
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::Not true...The Nets suck
kyle williams is my hero::umm...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................NO
brickznujerz::1 game out of the playoffs hahaha.... Lets get this W tomm all hold the fort down till Lopez comes back we'll be aight
Mcatee1117::Haha ya'll play Chicago at the United Center. There is always the next game!
Chris72077::Well I guess the bobcats played okay in the second half........
drftw42134::Good game Nets! Nice bounce back!
metsrule1296::Great win Nets! Hopefully we can salvage another win tomorrow night.
metsrule1296::That foul made no sense. They should've fouled earlier but i'm not gonna complain.
metsrule1296::At least this Bobcat team is good for something... beating the knicks!
Chris72077::Melo should have stayed in Denver
kyle williams is my hero::he shoulda strucutered the last deal different and joined wade and bosh in miami b4 LBJ could go there
CarlosV1323::Every team is good for beating the knicks..
Chris72077::And the lakers, we always somehow beat the lakers
blazerbeast24::Did DJ Augestin get hurt?
Chris72077::I think I saw someone say he had an inflamed big toe or something
ant108::tryina find out the same thing, need to drop him from my fantasy squad
NardVa::I put my money on a bad team in the Bobcats against a bad team in NJ.  I should have put my money on a bad Bucks team against a good Heat team.
drftw42134::You never know that might just hit the over but Bobcats are not really getting the offense rolling.
CarlosV1323::Wasnt thier a guy name Kornets always trolling on Nets game?
ant108::88.80.11.29
jVillaNyC::first row sports bros
Luke the Great3::ok thanks
ant108::fk nvm, they usually have all the games there idk why they dont today
ant108::yep, just copy n paste n hit enter
Luke the Great3::ok
Luke the Great3::is this a website
ant108::enter that in ur web address n it'll take u to the new atdhe
Luke the Great3::What website is everyone watching this on?
Luke the Great3::i noticed that the Miami vs. Bucks have over 1000 comments and this has just over 100 comments. Nobody cares about the nets and Charlette
CarlosV1323::If you only like them for D will your sorta a bandwagoner. I also go for the Clippers cuz of CP3 soo ya. Andd well yeaah knicks arent doing so good either
Luke the Great3::the only reason people would ever like those teams is Deron Williams and they live in the town. Im suprised most NJ fans aaren't fans of the knicks instead
metsrule1296::why would we be fans of the knicks? If your from Jersey then you should root for your hometown team.
CarlosV1323::Only reason their fans is cuz their from that city i live in Idaho and have no teams and go for the Heat so im a bandwagoner
Chris72077::But If you start liking a team because they are one of the best then you are a bandwagoner. Also people who like multiple teams tend to be bandwagoners cause if one of their teams are having a bad year and another a good year they only care about the team playing well
CarlosV1323::Just cuz their close doesnt mean i have to like them. Even tho there good teams
Chris72077::when did you start liking the heat? Wouldn't it make more since to like the trailblazers or the jazz? A team that is just a state over
metsrule1296::that makes sense because they are on national tv pretty much every week. so u get to watch.
metsrule1296::no one cares. All those people are bandwagon heat fans. Us net and bobcat fans are loyal. And if no one cared about the nets or cats no one would be on this board....
AndyDawgs713::F**k yeah, metsrule.
Chris72077::metsrule needs a standing ovation for that
Chris72077::Thank you
Chris72077::there is an o in charlotte
CarlosV1323::Two of the worst teams in the NBA. Giants playing. Im surpised it has a 100
Gina_Hanson597462::Charlotte Bobcats vs. New Jersey Nets   a site i stumbled on to help you make a decision:   http://bit.ly/A0iEJ3
jd1981philly::Bobcats should get rid of basketball all TOGETHER

Talentsojhin::why?
metsrule1296::Anthony Morrow is a beast
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::ummm Never thought a spot up shooter was considered a beast.? Steve Kerr was such a beast
metsrule1296::Net fans:If we could acquire howard today for brooks and picks would you make the trade?
urbandigsnyc::No. It makes no sense to have D12 and Lopez on the same team. Dwill-Brooks-D12, now thats a core to build around
drftw42134::No; regardless of how good Dwight Howard is you would not want to trade a good  player like Brooks because him and D-Will are getting the Chemistry going. Look at the result of the Knicks and Nuggets trade. Not that Dwight Howard is what we call a (ball hogger) but you can't give up too much just to recieve and it would be the wise move not to trade Marshon Brooks.
metsrule1296::that's true. I would trade lopez. Brooks is gonna be an monster
sari3213::$@%!
drftw42134::I actually expected more from the Bobcats after losing a close one to the Bulls. They are a better team than that and as a Nets fan I feel like this game is very uninteresting. Atleast try to play some ball.
Chris72077::it wasn't that close of a game, Bobcats were down by 19 in the fourth and made a late push
GeeJaySee::What's wrong with augustine?
siul11::inflamed big toe
Talentsojhin::He has a case of the Idontcareanymore.
siul11::is deshawn stevenson really on the nets starting lineup?!?!?
HowBoutThemSparties::ahh i took the 2nd half under a second late!
mikeyjm1412::if the nets win, then the mets win the world series...
mikeyjm1412::they have a bunch of scrubs...
mikeyjm1412::not really. they are going to be sorrier this season than they were in 1962...
mikeyjm1412::they should sell the team...
metsrule1296::i know. it's pretty sad what the wilpons are doing to the Mets.
metsrule1296::YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Agree but Mets are favorites every year to win the ws!
Sharukh86::damn over 192 was on pace now doesn't stand a chance
Sharukh86::doubtful
Dynasty of the Kiid::it still has a chance.
metsrule1296::C'mon Nets! Let's win
mikeyjm1412::You can't spell Ne_ Jersey without a W!
eagles2k12::what a s.hitty game both teams wouldnt beat kentucky
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::dumb
brickznujerz::lets go jersey get this w
BALABILA::Bobcats arent interested in defending, there not interested in winning....They just want to run up and down the floor, score, pad there stats and pretend they are playing in the school yard.  They dont care about winning
Talentsojhin::Why should they? They have an owner who does not want to pay anything for anyone.
NardVa::Bucks are the same way. A bad team but they compete.
