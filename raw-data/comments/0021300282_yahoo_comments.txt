Thomas::I'm going to tell my mother on you. She will straighten you guys out! Cavs must have missed there afternoon nap and sleep walk through another stinker.   1. It's pretty sad for these millionaires to forget how to fast break.   2. Beginning to wonder if they have a confidence problem.  3. Or is it a focus on the rim problem when shooting......  4. Let's not forget the other personal issues.  I can go on but I'll spare you....
Cyril::It might not be a terrible idea to put Gee and Bennett on the inactive list and let Felix and Sims play a little.  Bennett needs to work himself into shape on the practice court before he plays anymore minutes and embarrasses himself further.  And on the plus side, Felix actually plays defense!  Didn't see a whole lot of that tonight.
delbert::kyrie better spend a few more hours in the gym on that jumper...
dc::Good win for America's team.  Korver is now a legend.  Kyrie Irving...nice goose egg kid.
Rob::Hawks are healthy, and Cavs don't have enough to take this one.  Korver sets the record- best pure shooter in the league.
Commenter::Am I missing something or was Kyrie expected to be the 2nd coming of LeBron?
dc::Hawks 112--Cavs 87.  Book it, its over.  No reason to play.
Commenter::"Kyrie Irving sucks"......"Kyrie Irving's a bust"......"I knew Kyrie Irving was overated".....really?......I wonder why EVERY GM, coach & player in the league disagree's with those IGNORANT point of views?....the guy had a bad night....happens to the BEST of them......but to the MASS OF INGORAMUSES, this means he sucks.....would explain WHY they're ignoramuses
dc::The Hawks are simply too sexy for the Cavs to compete.
David G::Wither for Wiggins  The campaign has officially begun Go cavaliers
