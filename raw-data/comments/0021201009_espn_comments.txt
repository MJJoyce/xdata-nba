Kin6_James::<b>The Heat won't be fined because they were actually injured. Chalmers didn't play against NO. If you watched the game, Wade turned his ankle against NO. Also, when Pop sat his players, it was a nationally telivised game and near the beginning of the season. We are now near the end when it's nothing new for players to get rest. <b></b></b>
JLinNASA::NBA is rigged.  YouTube actual game footages of fake calls.  It was upsetting and sad.   I predict not one, not two, not three but multiple championships. -David Stern

Go Vols99::there are 68 entries in the march madness pool
tehgazagoo::lol heat fans thinking they have a dynasty. almost as funny as le-choke thinking he will keep his hair.
AIR4CE SPEED::I bet tehgazagoo has a big porn collection....under his bunk bed.
petejensen11::are you blind?
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::Lebron James doesn't need you to defend him fa,ggot. And trust me, Cleveland is gold compared to that sh it hole of a city called Detroit.
hartzellj::Well, Queen LBJ may have wins, he may have money, he may even have a 'lets sign with best 3 talent' NBA rings...... but, damn that hair line is moving up higher on his Pool Table Forehead.  Drop the Headband LBJ, Charles was right... time to accept, you're a balding man.
hartzellj::.. Wow , he would 'stomp' me in the ground ?  Really?  Because the Queen can jump high and dunk a ball, now he's all MMA tough ?  Get out of here.    And, no, thats not all I got on LBJ.  I still remember him and the other chump DWade making in fun of Dirk in the NBA Finals 2 years ago on camera sniffing and acting like they had colds because Dirk had Allergies.  Thats not all I got on LBJ.   Stomp me?  Maybe in a game of 21.  But ..... in the ground ?  Please.  Dont escalate your man love for Queen LBJ into some sort of idiolized God.  I have a feeling... lifes stomped you in the ground plenty, and your MAN CRUSH on LBJ disillusions you.
AIR4CE SPEED::"...he may even have a 'lets sign with best 3 talent' NBA rings..."  Who DOES that, right?!?  Hahaha  Who would, in their right mind, seek out stars to put on their team roster?!  That's just $@%!$@%!!  Hahaha  Wait.................. Lakers (three times) - Wilt Chamberlain, Shaq, and now Nash/Dwight Howard Boston - Garnett, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Jason Terry New York - Carmelo, Stoudamire, Jason Kidd, and Tyson Chandler  $@%!, hater....
Mambaholic 33::Rose waiting for Lebron to retire before coming back?   --LMAO
Skynet33::What a shallow statement, is that all you got on lebron, Im sure his balding a.ss would  stomp you in the ground. I would love to see you say that to his face.
hartzellj::Maybe if he rubs his 'ring' on his head it will save him.  Doubt it as .... "magical" as of a ring it was.
LeBron James MVPX4::wow
kenny352352352::Anybody know how many entries there are in the March Madness pool?

AIR4CE SPEED::The Cavs took a 42-game plummet on the WINNING side after LeBron left, and you cannot say the Cavs were "the team to beat".  Who else was a "star" on that team?  Exactly!  Next.....
Rob_Gronkkkkkkk::Koke hates his bracket. LOL
ERAofMiguelCabrERA::And you Cavs fans are mad at Lebron??  Don't be mad at Lebron, be mad at your incompetent owner whos brain is as empty as Al Capones vault!!
Rob_Gronkkkkkkk::Lol who is your team?
ERAofMiguelCabrERA::He made the Cavs relevant for 7 years......................ONLY 7 years of relevance out of it's total existence!! How sad and pathetic that organization is!!!  NO wonder he left!!!
ERAofMiguelCabrERA::I don't blame Lebron for leaving!!!  He deserved better.
ERAofMiguelCabrERA::With the 1st of pick of the 2003 NBA draft the Cleveland Cavaliers select: Lebron James!!!  And what did that bring them???  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!  Because the owner was to cheap to spend and make smart moves...........so he resorted to average to below average players or washed up hasbeens like Jamison and Shaq.  Way to go Gilbert way to go dummy!!!!  You wasted 7 years of Lebron James god given talent for NOTHING in return!!
AIR4CE SPEED::Let the church say "Amen"......!!!!
Double..Cheese--::whats this they have a bracket? well it must be good---- dumb people who buy into march madness for the actual games. LOL
