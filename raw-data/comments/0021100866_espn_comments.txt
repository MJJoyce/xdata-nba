L.A.beanbryant::gonna be more of the same on tuesday fellas!!!!!!!! GO LAKERS
kevinloveistherealmvp::trade gosal for a draft pick and get tony wroten
kevinloveistherealmvp::this game is y kobe is trade bait bynum is the best player on lakers team
chiefsfan716::I am BACK!
-HUNGLikeLin::The lakers are a joke with kObe
elibird123::Yep, that Kobe guy will never make it in the NBA
truwinner818::I am the Chosen One "Darth Winner" and by my use of the force the Lakers will win it all this year
1871jupdog::when you  kill yourself then it might happen
mauriello1776::Since the Lakers thrashed the Spurs in the 2008 WCF the Spurs have not seriously contended. The Spurs were the #1 seed last year and got whipped Round #1. Somebody is really going to have to sell me on how the 2012 version is somehow different than the last three years...because watching Bynum playing volleyball with the glass last night, tells me the Spurs would have no chance against the Lakers in a best 4 out of 7
1871jupdog::since you wanna talk about last year who got swept spurs or lakers?
DaRealMaverick::Lakers got swept in the semi-finals by the eventual World Champs.....Now who did the Spurs lose to in the first round???
Bexindy55::Man that loss stung last night.  Props to the Lakers for kicking our behinds.  Its becoming more apparent that we'll have to pull D Robinson out of retirement if we want to try and compete in the playoffs...hopefully he's been staying in shape.
LakerHaterNumber1::I was all torn up about the Laker thrashing we received last night and my only tip to you my fellow Spur fan is to call one of your buddies, rent the movie Brokeback Mountain, and share your feelings and fears with each other. That's usually what us hardcore Spur fans do in the fangroup I'm in. Hope this helps.
LakerHaterNumber1::Look Jules, I don't know what's going on but I imagine that someone has played a joke on you and you're not taking it too well. Perhaps you're not clear on what happened and have mistaken me for someone else. You're just talking crazy.   Now, what exactly happened?
Julie.Again::Double $@%!$ move.  Weak.
LakerHaterNumber1::Are you sure it was me? There might be a LakerHaterNumberl, too. I see no post on your wall. Are you feeling ok?
Julie.Again::You are such a clown.  Oh, and weak.  Post crap on people's wall and only allow comments from friends on yours.  Such a $@%!$ move.
mark35345::Thank you honest Spurs fan - but truly - didn't it look like they were playing for the third best team in the West? It just looks like either the Thunder or the Grizzlies could wipe the mat with either the Lakers or the Spurs. I hope I'm wrong but those other teams look faster and are better defenders.
carttheman1::Obi Wan Carttheman1 is back.
truwinner818::I am the Chosen One "Darth Winner" and by my use of the force the Lakers will win it all this year
FTLakerFan::anybody see Bynum at the end of the game last night, with only a couple seconds left, Blake had the ball and was just dribling it out, but Bynum wanted to shoot a 3, he kept calling for the ball and Blake wouldnt give it to him, then Bynum came over and tried to take it from Blake, luckily time ran out and Bynum didnt get to throw that 3 up.  Brown would have killed him if he tried that.  Even after a great game, he wants to do something stupid like that.  Then during the live TV interview right afterwards, he says "I shot the ball like $@%!" and doesnt get bleeped.  Quite the night for Andrew
Hair Clippers LA::Yes, quite the night.
rex_coach::30 Bounds!
trooooowa::andrew bynum is making himself quite a name out there. if u dont want ur skull to be crushed, dont penetrate the paint.
el_dude00::LA Destroyed, embarrassed, humiliated, prety much anything else-ed, my Spurs. That was a butt whipping. Nice job LA. Very nice job.
FTLakerFan::nice of you to say but its just another regular season game, one of many, see you guys in the playoffs
chiefsfan716::IM BACK
chrisd867::Who cares?
sutherlacd27::this was a good win by the lakers and thats that.  the spurs are still a great team and as a lakers fan i most certainly dont want to see them in the postseason.  spurs fans will say the same about the lakers.
SoCrazyIJusMightWork::We would beat them in the post season..
sutherlacd27::i think the lakers with a healthy kobe are good enough to beat any team but i still dont want to see a vet spurs team in the postseason.
kempstylez40::Bynum is the best gimmick player on the Lakers.
mauriello1776::Gimmick players shoot 3,s, Block Shots, or just play defense. Bynum is an All Star and the 2nd best center in the league. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but the point you are attempting to make is absolutely ridiculous.
This is Los Angeles::Nobody wants to see Bynum in the playoffs
el_dude00::This is Los Angeles - Nobody wants to see Bynum in the playoffs  I'd love to see the petulant, I get ejected from the game Bynum. But I'm afraid the "I'm grabbing everything and shooting a high %" Bynum is the one that we'll see. *gulp.*
aaronc426::Overrated is what it means, he's a baby,he crushes Barera when their losing!
sutherlacd27::actually it says quite a bit.  it gives the lakers a big advantage at one spot on the floor over most other teams.
ustna::Which doesnt say much...
sutherlacd27::hes immature but hes a good player.  2nd best center in the league
HeeSawnFyer::If anyone on the Lakers is a gimmick it might be the guy named "World Peace"
HeeSawnFyer::Though his D is no fad
SoCrazyIJusMightWork::what does this mean?
Jai22T::30rebs is great but LA needs Drew to play big every night and be smarter and mentally tougher.
ustna::lol...good luck with that
HeeSawnFyer::"Pulling down the first 30-rebound game in the NBA in more than two years"----&gt;False.  Kevin Love had 30 rebounds in a game in November 2010 against the Knicks.
This is Los Angeles::Love is only respected because he comes from the best college basketball program in the nation - UCLA!
elibird123::HeeSawnFyer - And Kobe's only respected because he's Jellybean's son  ************ And here I am thinking it was because he's kicked so much a.ss over the years...learn something new everyday
Dioku::I thought it was because he played High School ball in Oregon...
HeeSawnFyer::And Kobe's only respected because he's Jellybean's son
HeeSawnFyer::Kevin would Love to see him try :-)
This is Los Angeles::Bynum would pick up Love and throw him
Dioku::Bynum didn't pick up and throw JJ so I'm guessing he'll still with the stupid elbow/shoulder heave to Love...and then regret it.
Dioku::Against a terrible Knicks team.  As for the 2 years comment 2010 is 2 years before 2012.  I doubt they were counting months as 5-6 months means little to the point of how impressive both these guys are getting 30 Rebs.  Edit: as for the "More than 2 Years" yeah they got ahead of themselves trying to explain how impressive 30 rebounds are.
Dioku::Fair enough.
HeeSawnFyer::Word.  I got their point, I was just picking at the details for fun.
Yungdubz27::I believe that was the game they was talking about.
HeeSawnFyer::That may be, but "more than two years" would be inaccurate in that case.
aaronc426::Along with 30+ points
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Love is good but he's a fisherman after Wolves lose the next game. Irrelevant in May - June.
Franchiz43::Well Rubio DID get hurt and you are NOT playing in May :)
aaronc426::Rubio doesn't get hurt we are playing in May...GFY Kobe!
This is Los Angeles::Ramon Sessions - 10 pts, 5 assists and left the game with Eva Langoria
ustna::huh?
aaronc426::Kevin Love went 30-30! Love&gt;Bynum&amp;Howard
StockDriverPat::Loves a center right? Love plays in L.A. right? Love plays alongside Kobe Bryant &amp; Pau Gasol right?
Dioku::PF vs Center, different positions different roles.  I adore Love, however he's not a premier Center...best PF in the league absolutely and by a long shot imo.  Better to compare Love to Gasol.
aaronc426::Plays both
elibird123::Bynum, hook shot and dunks .....&lt;--- I think you should watch him play more
aaronc426::Bynum, hook shot and dunks Howard, crappy hook and dunks Love, post, floater, dunks, mid jump shot, 3 point shooter... You're right they are really close in offensive presence...
PekingDunk::Is Love a C or a PF?
This is Los Angeles::Bynum makes Love carry his bags
aaronc426::Nether of those guys are near his offensive presence!
aaronc426::What about steals, assist and fouls less and goes to the line more?? Love!
jcmaggi::Bynum averages 70% of the points Love averages  Love averages 25% of the blocks Bynum averages
aaronc426::Love 26 per Howard 20 Bynum 18  Love wins by a lot
ustna::Come on now...Andy is hardly a defensive powerhouse
jcmaggi::they're closer in offense to Love than Love is to them on defense.
jcmaggi::Kevin Love is nowhere near the defensive presence that either of those guys are
LakerHaterNumber1::Shields are a go! Onward Alliance!! We shall thwart the evil Lakers in our bid for relevancy. Everyone synchronize swatches and meet on facebook for an emergency meeting at 0600.   Darth LHN1 out.  For the Alliance!
PekingDunk::You sound like a flu virus with your LHN1.
mas93287::Bynum's post game is definitely better than Howards.   Also, Bynum has a nastiness about him that Howard doesn't posses. I think it gives Bynum an edge that Howard just doesn't have.
chrisd867::Julie.Again--- True Lakers fan or paid public relations for Kobe?
Julie.Again::Really?  REALLY?
mas93287::Bynum &gt; Howard
ustna::at what? That was a pretty vague statement.
Dioku::I'd say overall he is more skilled.  Defense is weaker by a bit, however he is vastly more skilled as an Offensive player especially FT's.
Dioku::I'm not sure I'm at that point yet, only due to longevity as I think Bynum has more skill.  However I'm certainly starting to move in that direction.
carttheman1::I'm gonna go to, be back 5ish.
mas93287::no one cares
chiefsfan716::Ok... guys i am going out for a little break. Be back here in about 2 hours
Hair Clippers LA::No one cares.
carttheman1::Everybody now call me Obi Wan Carttheman1
LakerHaterNumber1::I am using alliance based jedi mind tricks to mess with your brain right now.   Can you feel it?
SirCrazyWolf.::Kobe is the best player ever. He's 500 times better than Jordan.
Lilwillaf24::Agreed
LakerHaterNumber1::You are up for re-evaluation after that one. We'll have to hold an emergency court martial hearing as this latest Lakers win has caused you to be a turncoat. When you signed the alliance waiver you agreed this wouldn't happen... GAWWWWWWWWSHHH, you're ruining every thing.   Meet on facebook at 0600 for your sentence.   WTF man, we gotta stick together.
Dioku::500 seems a bit much...I'd only be willing to go up to 450 times better.
Dioku::I was implying that you were lying about not looking at my "goofy pic".  Then again my lack of intellect obviously impairs my ability to converse as your equal.  The short of it, no hard feelings.
chrisd867::Huh?
Dioku::You don't gotta lie to kick it bro!
chrisd867::I was just joking, dude. Didn't even look at your picture.
Dioku::You don't seem to get my point of mocking SCW do you...Lucky I'm stupid and have a funny looking face to help out though.
chrisd867::Flagged for stupidity...and a goofy pic.
chrisd867::Flagged for stupidity.
chiefsfan716::I am confused on who are Laker/Kobe haterz and who are not on here.
Dioku::Don't confuse the Team with a player.  Life long Laker fan (back in the 80's).  Kobe is super talented in the game, not so sure about making the best of choices outside it especially in relationships.
carttheman1::I told u, i'm dieheart la laker fan.
carttheman1::Oh, k.
chiefsfan716::I mean the others.
LakerHaterNumber1::We must hate the Lakers even more when they win, don't lose faith.   Remember everyone needs to report to the costume rental store by Friday to make sure they have a Nuggets jersey rental available for you.  This is a direct order from Darth LHN1.
carttheman1::Don't listen to him, i, obi wan Carttheman1 say to join the light.
carttheman1::Everybody jump ship to LA, its your only hope.
boom.shaka.::I'm your only hope.  Regards, O. W. Kenobi
.SouthCentral.LosAngeles.::LAKERS HATERS=ENVY,ENVY, AND MORE MODAFUKING ENVY
SirCrazyWolf.::We Lakers fans need to stick together...lots of haters in here today
LakerHaterNumber1::Are you jumping ship too, admiral? This latest Spurs loss is really taking a toll on the federation. I think someone needs to call an emergency facebook meeting before this thing spirals out of control.   ALL HANDS ON DECK!
WatEvasCleva24::ST.FU Bro ur not a Laker fan but I bet u wish u where
carttheman1::If your cool with kobe, i'm in.
chiefsfan716::Hes not. Hes tryin to play u
chiefsfan716::U are mocking us are u?
chiefsfan716::Oh. Well than the answer is yes
carttheman1::Not u, sircrazywolf.
chiefsfan716::?
carttheman1::He is mocking us, nevermind, are u a true LA fan, or a spie from Darth LakerHaterNumber1?
carttheman1::I just sent 5 more spy's out to figure out your plan Darth LakerHaterNumber1
Drink Milk n take vitamins::USTNA Image almost appears to look like he is wearing a Raiden(mortal combat)  Hat
LakerHaterNumber1::I told you he's like a ninja sent to infiltrate our ranks and expose our plans.
carttheman1::Ok, Darth LakerhaterNumber1
Drink Milk n take vitamins::undercover
ustna::Yeah I've noticed that..
Drink Milk n take vitamins::i just like your comment lol
chiefsfan716::Its sad when the haterz try to say they are Laker fans. Bunch of lyin pu$$ies
carttheman1::I'm not lying.
carttheman1::K, good.
chiefsfan716::Than u are fine.
carttheman1::Heck no.
chiefsfan716::U arent a hater, are u?
Drink Milk n take vitamins::I love coming to work and bash on USTNA!  Like Visa its priceless
carttheman1::I'm sorry "LakerHater1" laker fans have not been defeated for 50 years, don't think your little group can stop us.
LakerHaterNumber1::Not if you keep resorting to having spies like ustna infiltrate our ranks. Sure we're weak now but we'll get it all figured out at the next meeting. We're synchronizing our swatches right now and we'll soon come up with a plan to defeat you Laker Heads.   You may call me by my real name , Darth LakerHaterNumber1.
PekingDunk::You're a terrible Sith.
carttheman1::ARE U MY FATHER?
carttheman1::Hey, we have RS7, can't stop us lol.
ustna::are you really falling for it?   wow
carttheman1::What?
ustna::"We don't need CP3, we have RS7" - Laker Tool  and yes, I have seen that posted
Lilwillaf24::really? I guess you have not seen Wat sessions has done. Plus sessions played great against cp3 he is still learning the system and by next year he will be different and more of an elite point guard
WatEvasCleva24::F.uck It Lakers needed a more descent point guard than fisher and they got one
Drink Milk n take vitamins::but you still suk ballz
Drink Milk n take vitamins::really? lol sometimes i must say our fans base can get a lil nutty at times what  the fak is RS7 guy makes to many errors on the court
Jairushawkinss::Wow.
mystik-eye::I just caught a Great White shark with a Mepps Rooster Tail and half a bag of Chips Ahoy cookies!
Jairushawkinss::<b>Khloe Kardashian.</b>
chiefsfan716::See the pattern, SirCrazyBiitch Likes HempStylez post in return for a $@%!$@%
WatEvasCleva24::There Butt Buddies
ustna::where?
kempstylez40::u mad?
chiefsfan716::U crazy?
SirCrazyWolf.::I've been a Lakers fan since 1963, I just believe Kobe belongs in prison for what he did to that poor innocent girl in Colorado.
ACandOJ::Are you still a little sore back there, Katelyn??
chiefsfan716::If u were a true lakers fan than u wouldn't have posted all that crap on here about kobe and your own team
Drink Milk n take vitamins::innocent? lol poor girl even more lmao
chiefsfan716::U LYING BIITCH
kempstylez40::"I wish I had as many bricks as Kobe" - Super Mario
elibird123::Shhhh, remember you say i'm trying to be like Jordan. I'm behind, he laid more bricks in 15 seasons than I have in 16 seasons.  ~Kobe
Drink Milk n take vitamins::Blake Griffin is just a highlight and highlights dont win rings! only a matter of time before they start calling offensive fouls on him always using his forearm to get the advantage ,dont get me wrong i like the kid but its just a matter of time and USTNA quit liking your own comments #yourlame
grapenutz78::this is hilarious!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwDluFZQmtQ&amp;feature=youtu.be
LakerHaterNumber1::I myself am extremely upset with ustna as he has trashed us Spur fans. Don't you know we have an allegiance as the Lakers b!tches to stand up with one another? How else can we hope to defeat them. Clearly he's a Laker spy and his true colors are starting to show in his attempts to break up our alliance. I think after our current losses our weaknesses are starting to show. Time to make more accounts and make rape jokes. We'll show them we mean business.
Drink Milk n take vitamins::Dont break the alliance! We must remain strong
PekingDunk::If ustna's a Laker spy, he's a really, really good one.
SirCrazyWolf.::I stopped reading after "I myself"
LakerHaterNumber1::You're not losing the faith too are you?
whodey894::<b>THIS JUST IN: TIM DUNCAN HAS ANNOUNCED HIS SUDDEN RETIREMENT AFTER BEING RAPED LAST NIGHT</b>
ustna::2/10
carttheman1::Who are the REAL laker fans on here?
carttheman1::I am. Just wanting to know.
SirCrazyWolf.::Here
PekingDunk::Ha.
chiefsfan716::ME!
chiefsfan716::Your mom is ugly as $@%! u $@%!
SirCrazyWolf.::You're not a Lakers fan, you're a Kobetard.
