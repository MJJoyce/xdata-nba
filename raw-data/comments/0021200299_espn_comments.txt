aj8707::lol @ people betting on the Over when it was 202...
IAMLEGEND_101::WARRIORS FANS GETTING HAPPY ABOUT BEATING LOTTERY TEAMS IN THE EAST. BROOKLYN WAS THE ONLY DECENT WIN
aj8707::it's still on the road, bro. they've won 4 in a row, bout to get a 6-1 roadie...
DeerandBeer94::Bobcats wont win again this season..HAHA
jeff050578::If Golden State were in the Eastern Conference they would be a 1-3 seed. They havent lost to an Eastern Conference team all year.  GO DUBS
DoubleV1369::also that isn't true, they lost to the Magic at home.
Yu_Darvish_and_Ichiro::They did not face the Heat or Knicks  DUDE
gregorywalts1966::Im using a bet system called sportsbettingstar the past couple months. I doubled my starting balance the first month and made over $3,000 my 2nd month using this system. If you search google for sports betting systems you can find out more.
TheReignMan40.::The Dubs in beast mode this season! If they keep slayin' the competition like this, it's gonna be gametime come April.
BayAreaSportsFan16::this is prolly the best the warriors have looked since 93-94
4th and 29::2005-07
Drunkard.::Wow. G State is a team? When the hell did that happen?
BillyJoelsSecondWifeFan::14-7????!!!! Warriors??? Wow! Does Jackson want to be a Coach Of The Year?? Impressive start of the season.
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_:::)
RZA_CONSOLE::get a real post player and the bobcats will be competitive  they got all the other parts  maybe stephen curry wouldn't hurt ;  )
---teethmold---::Larry Johnson, and Alonzo Mourning would look good in the post!! While we're at it, changing the name back to Hornets will change the perception of the franchise.
ghijada::Bring it home dubs .. 3 more to go ! Let's finish strong going back home next week :D
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::Nice win, despite the brutal 4th quarter sheesh. We seem to have quarters like that randomly.
GoldenStateWarriorsAreLegit::Just a quick video I made about the Warriors. Hope you all enjoy it!!  http://youtu.be/wv8u_mOBBlg
aj8707::big props dude
OaklandRaiderFan2105::Nice video man!!
TotalJester::I'm in my mid 40s and I've been a Warriors fan through THIN.....hopefully it's time to find a new line. Go W's!
vusani::Time to get THICK!
WarriorsWarrior::Lotta thin ha!
Justin25733::hey associated press: you don't ever have 'a myriad'; it's just 'myriad'. if you're going to use hifalutin words in an nba article... use them right.
WarriorsWarrior::Wow 14 and seven with eight road WINS already
dwb320::Only 8 road wins last year.8-1@ Eastern Conf.!
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::Hopefully crappy $@% Andruw Bogut comes in and contributes in 2 years when he's healthy.
ChuckGF::he's far from crappy
Oaktown1029::word.
Oaktown1029::Yeah, this is the best I've seen a Warrior team play for a long, long time. The Baron Davis teams were decent but it was always pretty much about Baron and Jackson. This team actually plays defense too. I'ts fun to watch.
WarriorsWarrior::Exciting
aussieking2::WARRIORS TURNT UP $$$ YEAH
ElvisTheKing16877::YEAH    Warriors OVER 102 points and I have won 1000$ like yesterday with the knicks.    Its a great night for me.    I bet and make money every day.    good night everybody
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::Don't care. Go away.
supe540::It's amazing to me that all these small time gamblers scream about the fix being in in every game yet they continue to bet their pennies.  Unbelievable.
Kevin129421::IM A 5 DIME PLAYER BUT THAT TOTAL OF 201.5 OR 202 WAS FUNNY MAN !!!!!!
samace23::what do you consider small time?
eatingrabbits::Small enough that they're on the wrong side of the "fix".
cjoconn82::nobody point shaves, they had the game in the bag didnt matter if they made the shot or not, its called running clock
ImpulsDilijan::The one bad thing about the Heat game is that there are going to be so many trolls on the board...
Raiders Godfather333::You think!
ImpulsDilijan::I don't know, do I have a brain? Yes, so I'm capable of thinking. :)
cballou18::It's really simple the Warriors used all 24 seconds every trip down and fired up a terrible shot.
SB4LlFE::it was funny how landry was hacked and pickpocketed all night and rarely any foul calls for him
Raiders Godfather333::They RAPED him tonight!
ImpulsDilijan::If you think the Warriors were shaving points, you're $@%!$@% insane.
samace23::from 5:22 until :22 in the 4th quarter they don't score a point?! Come on bro nobody is that cold...
jomarbayarea::honestly if you watch enough Dubs Basketball sometimes they just can't score especially when they dont get called for being fouled.
ImpulsDilijan::Fast-paced teams aren't always going to score. They're gonna go on a cold streak sooner or later.
danglehossa22::11 points GS, im so ticked because this is the second time something like this has happened. Last night or saturday Toronto scores 10 in the fourth to kill the over and spread. Hey, if you can't take it than you shouldn't be betting
cjoconn82::only the 3rd time all year a charlotte game has been lined 200+, all unders
yeates_kevin::Wow way to score 11 pts in the 4th.lost the over by a point sweetttt
bringbarryback11::point shaving at its best. GSW didn't try to score
cjoconn82::a sore loser at its best, blaming point shaving for his loss
R8DRNTN::Hard to score when you're getting hacked with no call.  Oh well, still won
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_:::)
ElvisTheKing16877::YEAH  Warriors OVER 102 points and I have won 1000$ like yesterday with the knicks.  Its a great night for me.  I bet and make money every day.  good night everybody  now I must go sleep.
ElvisTheKing16877::YUP  And we see us at GRACELAND!!!
ImpulsDilijan::Elvis has left the building.
jumpy785::But wow, D. Green is very damn sucks
JWiLLgsw::He is good at what he can do. Rebounding. Hustle plays. He can also score with jumpshots given the chance.
ImpulsDilijan::He is very damn sucks...wow.
cballou18::Yea it took Rome 1000 years to fall. America is going to pull it off in less than half the time.
ImpulsDilijan::cballou18 - ^exactly what I was thinking  America is falling, my brother. One of the many reasons will be credited to jumpy...
cballou18::^exactly what I was thinking
JWiLLgsw::Bobcats I hope you guys make the push for playoffs though. I feel your pain. Its just like the way us Warrior fans use to feel.
Mettaworldmene::I winnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For hall a point yessssssssssssssssssssss 500€* 1.70=850 Thanks guys i love you
ElvisTheKing16877::stay cool  I have won 1000$  with the OVER 102 for warriors.  its a great night for you and me.  Its a money night for us!!!
ImpulsDilijan::Time to beat the Heat!
WarriorsWarrior::Good Game
jumpy785::exactly 200 points
jrwilli04::Its called point shaving. David stern should fine the warriors for being a disgrace to the game
GoingStreaking06::Stern should be fined for being a disgrace to the game
samace23::yes it def was..I have never seen anything like thst...they really shaved points....thats crazy...i saw it in the 2nd quarter...
R8DRNTN::Stern should fine his Refs for being a disgrace to the game
PK009::if you bet under your prayers were answered
Mettaworldmene::What a $@%!$@% lucky
cballou18::Remember when these boards actually talked about basketball and not gambling?
WFan5::When the bandwagon comes we will welcome them with open arms
cballou18::Yea it will prob lean more towards basketball later in the year just annoying listening to everyone talk about the over/under every game.
WarriorsWarrior::Name change:  Road Warriors!
Talentsojhin::good game warriors fans good luck the rest of the way except when we play again :)
supe540::ty
cjoconn82::had the under, that over hits 49 out of 50 times after the 3rd qtr...very lucky
samace23::that was rigged they def shaved points...
cjoconn82::why because you lost, its point shaving now?
WFan5::nobody cares
cjoconn82::sorry bout your over bet bro
cjoconn82::warriors fan?
supe540::Whoo hoo Dubs with a brilliant 4th to pull this baby out!
pst23.41::NE 21 HOU 0 Brady just raping that defense
RapCity421::Wow under hits. 11 points for GS in the 4th. UNREAL

samace23::yea bro congrats on the win but the warriors def shaved sum points...
bringbarryback11::lol easy ya right. that 3rd quarter should have made the over easy money.Congrats on the win
bellser21::Too ez ur $@%.  Just lucky, but hey that is what it is all about -luck.

outkastD::4-0 away..hopefully they can beat the heat! o_O
EL_GRINGO_LOCO444::STAY UNDER 205!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
cballou18::I've honestly just accepted the fact that NBA officials will always be blatantly one sided in every game. It really doesn't matter who's playing.
Cbowzer::There have been a lot of studies that show they favor both home teams and losing teams.
cballou18::It's just bad it happens every single game
SB4LlFE::yeah.. it was kinda ridiculous with this game
