ChipMillard3::I was at the game, and was glad to see the 76ers come back and dominate the Wizards from the middle of the 2nd quarter on.  You can do that when you aren't settling for long jumpers on every possession and actually play with some effort on defense.  BTW, there is no way the attendance was anywhere near 18K.  There were probably more empty seats than full ones at the Verizon Center last night.
Trespayne::0-11 hahaha. Wasn't he like the 2nd or 3rd pick?
JDRacer4747::9th place?  Who plays forward for the Wizards, Jackie Moon?

PhillyEPS::30 years ago...championship :)  May 31, 1983.....fo' fo' fo' !!!! Someday, maybe again... :)
Advocate4Greatness::Chase of 9th place?  Such high standards for the Wiz
msrocz::philly ML was free money
CZuver99::Evan Turner lives up to his bust status
Advocate4Greatness::He wouldn't be a bust if he wasn't the 2nd pick.  His draft position clearly is the reason.  Evan is not a bad player, just not a star
PhillyEPS::Love my 6ers, no matter what :)
Brandon21Hartman21::Good job Wiz! lose enough to keep a better draft pick
Brett197683::Overpaided chocking black c u n t s
