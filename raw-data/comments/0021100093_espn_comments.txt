wildcatman78::dang where did daniela go?
Soonerhopeful1::Clippers look to be the " real deal"...!
OFrog::Hi, I'm Kevin McFail, you might remember me as that great forward on those Larry Bird teams. Well since then I have continued my career assembling junk rosters and proving what a lousy coach I am. My teams resemble road kill, barely compete and are a disgrace. Grab the wife and kids and come out and watch us get our butts kicked. We barely try, and lose by double digits every game. Your home team will never look better.
PartyLikeACaveman::i went to the game at staples vs the heat last year, and they hung 40 in the first quarter in that game as well.  Even though i caught this game from the couch it was almost as exciting, or possibly even more. great game from start to finish, you had the steak and the sizzle, good D, great O, great enegy.  I hope these guys can continue to gel, dang cp3 was brilliant last night
otownmagic4life::Good for the Clips, I just don't want Griffin to gas himself out early in his career by playing so hard all the time,but i guess its Go Hard or Go home for him.
PartyLikeACaveman::hey, only playing 32 minutes in a blow out is a good start
Ball-aholic::Don't you go hard at work everyday?
Cadillac_Too_Cold::It's good to just enjoy watching this Clippers team. Because the Trade, combined with Donald Sterling, will keep this franchise from building a solid team. This unfortunatly is the best we'll see in a long time.
Toyonaka3115::when franchise players want to play with CP3 on his 2nd season with BG, guarantee it that CP3 will stay longer.
PartyLikeACaveman::will the world end in 2012 oh great one?  players decide what are good teams these days, they want to play in south beach, or they want to play in new york... why wouldn't a guy want to come play in LA with Blake and CP3, i know its hard to swallow, but the clips are a place guys wanna play now
Cadillac_Too_Cold::I don't believe Chris Paul will stay past his contract. Aside from my thinking that he won't want to stay there, I don't believe Sterling will be willing to pay him like he'll command in FA, while paying Griffin and Jordan. This is the best Clipper team for now, but it could've been better without the trade.
Garpo1964::Watched Houston against the Lakers last night and tonight watched the Clippers against Houston.  There is no doubt about who is the best team in L.A. this year.
iriepacific::@ Garpo..love it :)
Garpo1964::Too slow.  Clippers know how to run and Lakers are a bunch of old guys.  Should be in the Wheelchair league by next season.
richardkim412::Seriously, Lakers/Clippers remind of when I finally could beat my dad at 1 on 1. You can't run from age... and you can't run with age. LOL.
Lakesho88::I wanna see Bynum rape your frontline. No $@%!.
PartyLikeACaveman::bynum is a beast, and gasol can make shots with d all over him, if you give those guys a ton of shots, and kobe like 15, i think the lakers would be a great team
Lakesho88::Yeah, the Lakers!
Garpo1964::1-Clippers 2-Spark 3-Lakers
ArtieSullivan::Lob city got everyone in on the action even 3rd string Leslie hahha  thats how we roll ... spread the wealth
_bulls1drose::hell yea...the clippers r guna be one of the most exciting teams to watch this year with paul throwin oops to griffin and jordan
Centennial2009::They have to learn how to make jump shots if they are actually a real team. I didnt know the and1 street ball team got to be pro now.
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::No jealous Laker fans here to hate on the Clippers... No fun
Lakesho88::Hate on what? Saw a lot of empty seats at the clips game today lol
Soonerhopeful1::19 thousand at the Clipper game... A sell out.  With all the Lakers fans whining, I am actually starting to feel sorry for them...          " Hate what " ?   you asked.... How about hating the team that is listed above Lakers in the division standings..!
gogata1987::Yeah when Chandler Parsons dunked on your over-rated Blake
Garpo1964::Never seen Staple center so excited and loud.  Fans were going crazy
jeffreydahmer60::Lebron James's hairline &gt; Knicks
Vote for Brian Scalabrine 2012 All Star Game::I voted to send Brian Scalabrine to the All Star game in LA.  Make it happen. Send Brian to the All-Star Game on http://www.nba.com/ASB
Lakesho88::DONE!!!
mrskinnybob::Sorry just getting here. Now let me get this straight one (1) dunk by Clips and it was Trey Thompkins? Please tell me I read the play by play wrong. Blasphemy, I tell you!
Allen Martinez::Lob City is no hype! Even Caron Butler got a dunk in there.
ArtieSullivan::LOL All you kids read wrong ... watch GD highlights  Lob City had 10+ highlight real dunks and lobs as always  peace out
Garpo1964::I watched the game and it looked like LOB and Dunk city all night long by the Clippers. Reminded me of an allstar game but only one team was actually allstars and it was not Houston.
convolutedthought::lol rubes
Centennial2009::I live in Minny so its finally nice to see Rubes tear it up a bit finally.
mrskinnybob::I bought too much of the hype, and I live in Detroit, so you can see my basketball situation. At least we got college ball.
Centennial2009::your welcome. It was only a matter of time before it would happen.
mrskinnybob::Figures. Glad I didn't DVR it. Thanks.
jtgault85::they should of never gotten the nickname "lob city" all hype, no game
Centennial2009::Blake Griffin got his a s s handed to him in a doggy bag. hahaha
barcakingsofspainalways::Anyone hear believe that some people are just born with bad luck while others always have good luck?.
Centennial2009::he says his socks off time is always hard to accomplish since he hasnt seen his p e n i s in five years.

Lakesho88::hahahaha
TDeezy20::lol
TectonicPlatter::On a serious note...Bosh is a good player all in all. I would rather have him on my team than Amare...just saying.
inter2010clchamps::obviosly bosh is better then amare. He is better defensively. He is not getting as many touches in miami as he was in toronto but he still gets 20+ points
mattfootball71::You must be a gay cuban you $@%! $@%! little $@%! sucking $@%!$
Daniela South Beach::Ok boys, thanks for letting me post on your thread ... had to find an alternative after the Heat-Pacers board got spammed to death.

Daniela South Beach::I've had it with Shaq hatin' on Bosh.  The Boshtrich is averaging over 18 pts, 8 boards, on 50%+ shooting ... and he's the third wheel on his team (might be fourth wheel in a couple years when Norris goes into beast mode).  Bosh will be an All-star this year!
Hub_CityBoy310::BOSH IS A BIITCH AN UR A MAN. HOW IRONIC IS THAT??????
TectonicPlatter::Well we can agree that Shaq needs to be fired, and go pursue his career as a Doctor.

Daniela South Beach::27
TDeezy20::how old are you daniela???
Daniela South Beach::He keeps on disrespecting him by refusing to acknowledge he is part of the big three.  When Kenny asked him if he still believes that (after his solid performance tonight), Shaq said something like:  'I know about the Big Three -- LeBron, Wade, and Udonis.'
Hub_CityBoy310::HELL ON HEELS IS DANIELA'S TWIN BROTHER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ohyeah379::You're a year younger than me then, but I hung with alot of the football players like PK Sam, Kyler Hall, and etc.  Who knows I may have crossed your path but back then I didnt go out as much.  I started partying hard at the strip and pots 06-07ish
Daniela South Beach::LOL, I use to be friends with Rix ... he was generally disliked by the other ballers
Ohyeah379::I still live in tally came back and ran track and cross country here in 03 but have been here since.  I actually had a few friends graduate from sports management in 2010, I'm not saying you werent here but I was just wondering how I never saw ya, because at FSU you see damn near everyone out at the publix on ocala, strozier or at the bars
Daniela South Beach::I was 2002-2006 .... i might not know your friends ... i didnt go out that much, but when I did it was pots and the bars on tennessee ... sometimes late night library.
