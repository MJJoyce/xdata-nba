64993366::Phoenix shot distribution is quite even, everybody got to touch the ball, and made each player felt like important in the game and contributed. In contrast, Phil was too focused on MCW, and tries to convert him into a Melo-like ballhog.
Doug::28 shot attempts for a point guard? Times have changed... as perspective, Penny Hardaway (one of the best guards in the 90s) had a career HIGH for 27 shot attempts in a game
Ardian::I don't understand why Plumlee isn't averaging more than 28mpg.  He's clearly the best option at center, and he can run the floor even if they want to run small.
jb::Philly just don't have the talent to make a serious run, maybe the next two years.
gary::Plum Dawg was awesome. The Suns need to work on  their defense. Go Suns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
clint::nice game Plumlee, nice "piece" also.
Vlad::the suns are definitely getting the most out of their players. great coaching
- LJ::10-25!!! mcw is a good rookie but i dont think he can be on the same level of the super rookie anthony cuttie boy bennett in the near future... it is like mcw = bosh, bennett = lebron...
S. L.::PLUM DAWG
- LJ::carter-williams sukkz... bennettwill be this seasons top rookie...
