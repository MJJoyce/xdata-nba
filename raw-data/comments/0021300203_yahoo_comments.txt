bgood2life::Apparently Hibbert told his coach, if you need me say the word,otherwise i will be Mr. Decoy and take a half night off.
fcbonilla::George Hill had a very impressive night.
Busy cutting crap::Hmm, somethings not right here- Ricky Rubio is our best defender in the starting lineup (arguably), and yet, we keep losing (largely) because we're getting torched by opposing PG's- Chris Paul, Aaron Brooks, George Hill... Curious. This team needs to find some bench scoring, and needs to hand some minutes to Gorgei Deng, the ONLY legit paint defender on the roster.
Steven McCormick::Paul George and George Hill --- taking it to the net for the Pacers . . . unfortunately, the Timberwolves are outclassed.    But if I were the Pacers I wouldn't necessarily take win for granted.
Jim F::Rubio can't shoot, Shved is playing horribly, Derrick Williams, our number two overall pick, doesn't even play, Turiaf is hurt. Pekovic is having trouble finding his new role. The two Kevins can't carry this team alone. I hope we trade Williams and RUbio.
Danny::@Paul George, the MVP candidate of this year~ I love this guy.
PKM::Pacers are too tough right now.
clint::wolves, this was a team effort, everyone contributed to this loss.
Anton::Rubio man...every game I watch the opposite PG is setting season-highs in points...how about you try hard in defense...ughh...
TayC::wow can you please turn the ball over a little more PG
