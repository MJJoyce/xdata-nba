jtr6789::Kemba only got 17 minutes?
woodyattjon::With the first pick in 2012 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Bobcats choose....
bernotas22@yahoo.com::DJ Augistin Sucks
milw-jay::Kentucky &gt;  Charlotte
ware1936::Since 1991 the team with the best chance of landing the #1 pick has gotten it only twice. You still have a 75% chance of not getting the pick if you are the bobcats.
carmine005::what does it say about the Bobcats when the best player on the team is the owner?
jjensen1192::damn i though detroit was better than that.
KURokedTHAT::bad teams..someone has to win:  http://www.allfreechips.com/?ref=sapcunc
TigersWingsLionsWolverinesPistons::WTG Detroit. Keep winning! Win every last game now. Draft doesn't matter, nor does making the playoffs. &gt;:0
kennyx4::Once again, the Bobcats snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.  It doesn't matter anyway.  MJ wants that number one pick.
AvengedByCats::At least Charlotte's relevant right now... Relevant in the fact that they are indeed the worst team in the league.
gouconnhuskies3::they shoulda made some moves at the deadline, they got some assets that'd be good backups on other teams
timetodienow1234::Besides Walker, Biyombo and Augustin, this team sucks. Even those three are role players/bench players on real teams. This team is just not going anywhere. I would love to see Coach K go there though and I'm sure that MJ would pay him 10 mil a year to try and validate himself as an owner.
wustm1dj::lol
gouconnhuskies3::kemba needs more mins! 7 asists in 17, while Augistine shoots 30%
Sniper_Brosef::quit winning DETROIT!!!!  youre killing your draft position!!!
twiggy81r::I understand the issues with coding and programming, but this game ended a while ago.
mesa504boy2::charlotte is so bad they dont even show up in the box score.
greenbeerd13ish::stattracker on yahoo is still stuck at 2:03 left if the 3rd
James04311::so is yahoo nba and nba.com
wustm1dj::As long as the Pistons don't make the playoffs, they still have a shot for Davis, Zeller, or Henson!
LeeRhyne1::i don't believe so
CheerstoLilWayne::I'd rather have Robinson, Drummond, or Sullinger than Zeller or Henson
wustm1dj::Perfect, then the lottery is OPEN!
Minnesota Supports OSU::Piston aren't making the playoffs....
PutYouOn::hell no
surfzone365::This was a good game.  You don't have to have 2 super-power teams playing for it to be a good game.  Congrats to both fans.
mr.jiggles248::y no boxscore?
a_tizzy::idk, my stattracker on yahoo is not working either
marcpru60::ouch, got taken to ot by this dleague squad! ouch
wustm1dj::True.  At least stuckey would have pushed them to cover -6.  Would've been fewer turnovers
CheerstoLilWayne::without Ben Gordon or Rodney Stuckey...nice try though
bob_ran5::The fact that PutYouOn is trolling Pistons fans means that he's worried the Pistons are about to become relevant.
bob_ran5::this year's draft is loaded too
wustm1dj::"Greatness" is going to be tough to achieve within 3 years, however playoffs will be next year.
a_tizzy::joe did it in 4 when the starters were cliff robinson, michael curry, atkins, etc
PutYouOn::hahaha i love it ha..ill give you guys 6 years
a_tizzy::i think playoffs for sure next year, 2-3 to get back to greatness
CheerstoLilWayne::With Monroe, Stuckey, Knight, and Davis/Robinson/Drummond/Sullinger???? more like 2-3 years
PutYouOn::thanks kind sir...
bob_ran5::if you really thought that you'd troll us 6 years from now.
a_tizzy::have fun being wrong
wustm1dj::They will become relevant....once they get rid of Charlie V, Gordon, and the plethora of no-name bench players.  Need a bonified center, a healthy point guard and a solid 2 off the bench
wustm1dj::Get him to restructure and I may retract my previous statement
CheerstoLilWayne::I'd keep gordon if it weren't for his contract.
wustm1dj::Ehh, overpriced for a used-to-be
bob_ran5::Gordon's fine. Get rid of Charlie V though
Minnesota Supports OSU::PISTON FANS!  http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/sort/homePct/order/false
wustm1dj::You'll have that  http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2004/sort/homePct http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2005/sort/homePct http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2006/sort/homePct http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2007/sort/homePct
a_tizzy::1 word, TWINS
CheerstoLilWayne::U MAD tool b i t c h??? UM and MSU &gt;&gt;&gt; Illinois as well LMAO!!!!
PutYouOn::hell yeah get to that money...
a_tizzy::chicago is better at organized crime tho
PutYouOn::im talking about pistons moron..i never said anything about detroit sports..pistons stupid f u c k
CheerstoLilWayne::I love how when you rag on Detroit, it's ok...but you get mad when people do it to someone else. PutYouOn is a low-life, pathetic tool of a troll who's jealous of Detroit's success in other sports that he only talks crap about NBA because it's the only place that the Chicago is better...for now
CheerstoLilWayne::Don't forget the Gophers in the NCAA football. What about Illinois PutYouOn???? LMAO!!!
PutYouOn::2 words...who cares
bob_ran5::what's your point?   Minnesota fans were like that until this year. Do I need to show you all those attendance championships the Pistons have won?  P.S. Only criminals root for O$U
wustm1dj::It's science
PutYouOn::bulls on top all day
CheerstoLilWayne::@PutYouOn...Nah, I'll be busy laughing at the TIgers, Lions, and Red Wings destroying your pathetic chicago teams and making the playoffs...enjoy having ONE sport to watchLMAO!!!!!
wustm1dj::Tigers even get to take their talents to Wrigley this year.
PutYouOn::i didnt know you could tell the future...guess even a morons get dejavus
PutYouOn::yeah cuz u can tell the future moron..
CheerstoLilWayne::uh-huh...yup, and then when the Bulls start to suck and some other sports team is good...then you'll switch and say "I don't care about basketball!" hahaha what a pathetic tool.
PutYouOn::good for you guys..i dont care im talking about basketball..you need bifocals...after all this is a basketball forum moron
CheerstoLilWayne::LAST YEAR IDIOT!!!! LAST YEAR!!! Lions made the playoffs...did DA BEARS??? nope. Tigers did...did Cubs or WhiteSux??? nope. LMAO!!! If you're going to talk about how much better Chicago is then Detroit, than you can't look at just one sport because it's more convenient for you.
PutYouOn::basketball moron baskeball...if it makes u happy to assume stuff just like the heat fans..go ahead..
CheerstoLilWayne::nah, that's just about last season...and you think the Redwings aren't going to make the playoffs? Who's the ignorant tool now? Tigers won't make the playoffs? LMAO! Lions were 10-6 last year despite having injuries to almost everyone and they won't make the playoffs again even though they'll only get better? What a moron
a_tizzy::with 14 games left... the 8th place knicks are probably not gonna cut it without amare lin etc
a_tizzy::i mean if theyre gonna win these "meaningless" games
wustm1dj::to get worked by daaa Bulls
a_tizzy::so really the bucs and detroit have a chance to compete for that spot
CheerstoLilWayne::seeing as how you're on this board??? I'd say so lol.
PutYouOn::it ruined my life
CheerstoLilWayne::PutYouOn is just mad that Chicago only won by 12 (and pulled away in the last 2-3 minutes) against detroit on chicago's home floor
PutYouOn::ur kidding about detroit right
PutYouOn::@cheers to lil wayne...have fun watching the playoffs while the pistons have gone fishing..
eliteskillz044::dude i went from 200 bucks to 17,000 at bookmaker in 6 weeks bettin aggressive, i guess its safe to say i no longer have any handicapping talent , ive lost like 15 in a row so fkng pathetic
surfzone365::da Bobcats....trying to get that lottery slots nailed down
wustm1dj::Who knows, the Pistons could win out and take the 8th spot in the playoffs.
wustm1dj::Sorry, I had to
CheerstoLilWayne::don't be sorry, PutYouOn is just a tool.
PutYouOn::stop it
smokey60525::its funny cuz nba.com has this game in the 3rd quarter right now lmao
dezmen101401::Wow can't believe Detroit won

twincities39::when are the stats going to be updated???????????????
TomShoe02::Wow, you know a game is bad when they don't even have a box score.
