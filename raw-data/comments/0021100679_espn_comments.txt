jgc711::are the lakers still good as an nba team or they are just morphing into a d-league team?
megan87119::Nah... They just don't want to show off to teams like the Rockets...
Liltexaschic::PS appearantly YOU don't know the meaning of sarcasm! Rockets won lakers loss...just like you are in this convo!
megan87119::I figured I am welcome to win an award anytime but I do not need to be welcomed by YOU!!!  PS if you didn't get the memo I am already welcomed.
megan87119::Why thank you VERY much!!!
Liltexaschic::Well I was wrong...the post above isn't the winner of least logical post...you just out did yourself again...you sure know your sports or lack of....btw very bad excuses for your team losing
megan87119::Only because the Lakers were nice enough to give them a chance...
Liltexaschic::Wtf???? You get my vote in least logical post ever...Rockets didn't even have Lowry or Martin &amp; still won...lmao
greenmagnum::lol. They've got the 6th best record in the league, does that answer your question?
bradonlywins::Kobe may be more talented but if i had to choose a player 15 years ago or whatever to start my franchise it would be Duncan just for the fact that he is willing to adapt his game from game to game if he doesn't have it going he isn't going to jack up 30 shots like an A-Hole hoping he will catch fire he is going to trust his teammates and do other things.
Mikeferrari23::Best interior offense?? Keep dreaming  At this point in kobes career he isn't the best at anything
TheFeedMachine::My bad. Forgot the term big men. That is why it said offensive in the NBA which isn't logical. I fixed it though.
TheFeedMachine::Kobe needs to stop chucking the ball so much. He has the best interior offensive big men in the NBA. Feed them the rock and let them go to work against an undersized Rockets front line.
elibird123::They feed the bigs all the time and try to get them going. Problem is they cannot be open all the time, they get double and triple teamed and can't get a shot off everytime. The Lakers are constantly running out the clock trying to do this and have to rely on Kobe to get a shot off in a lot of situations, because he has been the only Laker on the squad that is able to create a shot
elibird123::Bynum cannot create shots. He is reliant upon other to get him the ball down low. Depending on how the other team is collapsing on defense he cannot get off a shot or a good shot. It's sad that you and other people cannot really see what's going on. To not recognize Bynum has not yet learned how to pass out of the double and repost in order to get a few more FGA's and good looks at the basket. Ramon can create and be a play maker. Great, but he just got here 3 games. 3-6, 1-7, 6-9. I think he'll be OK for this team.
tonythelakerfan::Ramon and Bynum can both create shots for themselves. If Kobe does not play team ball, it's going to be a waste of a good roster we have. It's sad the way Kobe plays.
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::elibird123 few and far between? Let's see they've played 46 games, so far this year and you all sure tend to harp on the 4-5 games he didn't shoot that well. ==========================  I am absolutely BAFFLED by this statement. Kobe has shot his team out of at least a dozen games this year. Comments like the one above are the sole reason why Laker$ fans get so much grief on these boards. Unbelievable...
TheFeedMachine::Another fun stat. The Lakers are 5-1 when Kobe shoots less than 20 shots in a game.
elibird123::Did it ever dawn upon you that the Lakers were playing so well they did not need Kobe to shoot as much trying to stay in those games. When games are close they rely on his scoring to keep them in games.
tonythelakerfan::Kobe will never realize that. His ego is sky high. He will keep jacking up with defenders all over him...
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::Exactly. Apparently, Kobe fans are holding Kobe to a lower-standard than the rest of the sports world. Shooting under 40% 16 times out of 46 games is unacceptable.
mawright04::exactly
TheFeedMachine::What do you consider poor shooting? Lets say under 40% is really bad. He has shot under 40% in 16 games this season. In those games they have a 6-10 record. 10 of those games have come in the last 2 months or 24 games.
elibird123::Actually 40% is not really bad, it's just not good. Utah Kobe was 3 for 20. Terrible shooting night. 103-99 Lakers lost by 4 Pts. 4th quarter started 75-71 Utah. Detroit Kobe was 8 for 26   Terrible shooting night. 88-85 Lakers lost by 3 Pts. in O.T. Stuckey torched them for 34pts. Lakers bench 7pts. Washington 9 for 31 Terrible shooting night. Lakers lost by 5 Pts. Lakers give up 52 pts in the paint &amp; get out rebounded  Nuggets 6 for 28. Terrible shooting night. Lakers lost by 8 Pts. 4th quarter started 72-71 Denver. It remained a 1 or 2 pt game until 1:21 left to play. Sixers Kobe 10 for 26. Bad shooting night. Lakers lost by 5 Pts. 4th quarter started 70-69 Sixers. With 2:44 the Lakers were leading 88-86. With 2:44 left Lakers allowed  Lou Williams to score 3 for 4 FG and 3 for 4 FT for 9 pts.  Knicks Kobe went 11 for 29. Bad shooting night, but was 11-13FT for 34 pts.  Lakers lost by 7Pts. They gave up 38 pts to J. Lin &amp; Bynum scored just 3 pts. Houston Kobe went 10 for 27 Bad shooting. Lakers lost by 3 pts.  Bynum got tossed. With 50 sec left Kobe ties it 101-101.  Now some how. I'm not sure, but you state all of these losses are due to Kobe's shooting. Well, like I said you can only bring up a few poor shooting nights out of 46 games, but there's more to the losses than "Kobe shot them out of those games."
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::1. Against Utah the other night.  2. Against Detroit.  3. Against Washington.  4. Against the Nuggets(6-28).  5. Against the Sixers.  6. Against the Knicks.  7. Last night.  Do you REALLY think that Kobe has only shot poorly in 4-5 games this year???
elibird123::You thought he owned me. Next time you want to co-sign somebody, you should wait for their comeback, numb nuts
mawright04::You owned him LMAO
elibird123::Really a dozen games...hmm Well if you can remember a dozen I'm sure you can recall 2 or 3 to refresh my memory where by if Kobe does not shoot his team would have won, instead of losing.....I'll wait.
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::SMH @ you Kobe fans still trying to make excuses for his shot-jacking. LMMFAO!!!
phx090::SMH @ you liking ur own comments. Do u really want people to care that much that u have resort to spamming. lol, get a life
phx090::SMH@ you liking ur own comments. do u really want people to care so much, that u have to turn to spamming. lol, get a life kid
u2cangetthebozack::I only have ONE question: Why is it that whenever someone points out that Kobe Bryant shot a lousy percentage from the floor, that person has to be termed a "hater"? The man was 10/27 from the floor, which is a FG% of 37; why am I a "hater" for pointing out the facts?
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::WHAT?!?!?! 4-5 games?!??!?! Have you been watching him this year?!??!?!
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::I gave him mad credit for that game, but those games are way few-and-far-between these days.
elibird123::few and far between? Let's see they've played 46 games, so far this year and you all sure tend to harp on the 4-5 games he didn't shoot that well.
ACandOJ::Because the same people don't say anything when he shoots 61% vs the Heat....
elibird123::Exactly, how come you don't mention all the other games when he is shooting great?
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::THANK YOU!!!! It gets SO tiring being labeled a "hater" for posting FACTS. It's funny and fitting that only Laker$ fans are averse to facts/stats.
u2cangetthebozack::Yeah, I know what you mean; the man was 3-20 the other night, but somehow I was a "hater" for saying that shooting 15% and still hoisting 20 shots probably wasn't a really good recipe for team success...
u2cangetthebozack::My apologies; technically that WAS two questions...
elibird123::Below Boom.Shaka gave you idiots a perfect example of shooting % between Kobe and two other shooters considered to be great shooters from the perimeter. Reggie Miller &amp; Ray Allen. You haters are so stupid.  #1) One of the biggest Kobe haters ZachC1965 agreed and said "That's about right...Kobe and Ray Allen/Reggie Miller are about equal..."  &lt;---Yay! Thank you for finally admitting Kobe is a great shooter, because all 3 shoot jumpers &amp; not a bunch of dunks&amp; layups - Awesome! ;)  #2) JK Belvi 2008 take the "number of shots" this guy launches, that 45% really doesn't look good at all....&lt;---.HUH? Thank you for letting everyone know how illogically your mind works. Strange, but in case there are other mental midgets out there I will try it this way. The more shots you take the chances of your FG% to go down increases, so if your still shooting at 45%; which is 9 made for every 20 taken...that is great! See #1 why this is great.   Ok 9 for 20=45%  10 for 20=50% #3) biggerandbetterthanyou  lets see at season ends where kome is &lt;--- Uhmm, just a wild guess off the cuff......45%?....LOL #4) You all do realize that MJ has taken and missed more shots in 15 years than Kobe has in 16 years, right? b.t.w. LBJ is on a transition / fastbreak team he gets more dunks &amp; layup chances, which means 1 or 2 more FG/FGA; therefore a 50%-55% average.
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::Like the person stated below: it really does add up over the course of a career. Kobe is a volume-scorer. It's as simple as that.
elibird123::Yeah he is a volume scorer and so was MJ. How did that work out for him? Adds up over the course of a career? &lt;--not really sure what you are trying to say here. But if you are talking about makes or misses, I can tell you that MJ has more makes &amp; misses in 15 years than Kobe has in 16 years, because MJ is the NBA's all time leader in FGA's per game.
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::Sorry, but 45% for a career from a guy who is supposedly "the best since MJ" just doesn't cut it.
elibird123::Sorry, but once again. You cannot do the math. In a game that would mean that the guy that shot 50% has made 1 basket more than the guy that shot 45%...duh!
ACandOJ::If only he could have made one more shot....
elibird123::boom.shaka. More fun with stats - today's lesson, "career FG%"    Isiah Thomas - 45.2%  Kobe - 45.3%  Ray Allen - 45.3%  Reggie Miller - 47.1%    In other words: not the best ever but not nearly as bad as some would hope. 1 Hour Ago  Like  Reply  Quote  Flag
KapriStylesFan69::It looks like LBJ is winning the "GREATEST SINCE MJ" debate over KOBE.....  2012 LBJ &gt; 2012 KOBE

ACandOJ::Math question....If I take roughly 20 shots in a game &amp; my opponent takes roughly 20 shots, I shoot 50% and he shoots 45%, how many more shots did I make??
JK Belvi 2008::1...  Now take 20,000 shots at 50% = 10,000 Now take 20,000 shots at 45% -= 9,000 (That's 2,000 points!)  It does make a big difference over a career...
elibird123::That makes a difference in total career points. Problem is that the points scored is on a game by game basis and you are only scoring 1 more basket made during a game.
princechristopherII::like five
boom.shaka.::It's only one:  10/20 = 50% 9/20 = 45%
princechristopherII::like 5
princechristopherII::i know
princechristopherII::the lakers fans have turned on kobe how classic
boom.shaka.::No, these are mostly haters.
JK Belvi 2008::"Kobe, why do you shoot and miss so much?"        - A 3-year old Laker Fan while asking Kobe for his autograph  Now all of you "Give Kobe Some Slack" buddies can see what's coming soon for the LA faithful!
ACandOJ::Lakers fans are pretty advanced even at that age....
JK Belvi 2008::Granted...
KapriStylesFan69::ha ha ha ha ha... LA trolls actually thought KOBE was/is the best since MJ.... ROFL....... KOBE is not even the best player in his era.... LBJ is GREATER than KOBE... Sorry, it's the truth!!!!!!!  Steve Nash = 2x MVP in KOBE ERA
ACandOJ::Nash has more MVP's than a lot of people....justified or not
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Kobe couldn't defend our country if he was in the military...he'd be missing the enemy half the time!;-)
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::How? If he even ain't in the military.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Did I day that? What's your point?
boom.shaka.::He doesn't have to answer you.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Kobe couldn't defend our country in the military...he'd be missing most of his shots against the enemy!;-)
JK Belvi 2008::Hey, be nice. Kobe defends his own country.
sutherlacd27::I'm pretty sure one of Kobe's shots was an impossible attempt at the end of the half, one was with something close to 1 second left on the shot clock, another with 5 seconds, and another he didn't even get a shot off but they counted as an attempt. You do the math and his fg% isn't bad last night.
boom.shaka.::No, it was pretty bad -- he had more than a couple ill-advised looks last night.
JK Belvi 2008::Perfect Comparison:  Brett Favre - Touchdowns to Interceptions  Kobe Bryant - Total launches to Misses  At this rate - he will make history! (if he isn't there already)...
ACandOJ::That's actually a good comparison except for the titles.  But Favre always thought he could get a pass thru 20 defenders....Kobe always thinks that he can get  shot off over 20 defenders.  I don't think either would trade their careers with anyone else
JK Belvi 2008::Well said.
boom.shaka.::Umm....Brett Favre is a first ballot HOFer and widely considered one of the greatest QBs ever.  Are you sure you want to compare Kobe to him?
ACandOJ::So you think that he is not 1st ballot right now??
JK Belvi 2008::There's no reason that Kobe can't be a first ballot Hall of Famer "if" he considers getting off the gas pedal a little bit. 5 rings - I don't see a problem.
beeeoooppp::After this season is over, somebody should count the number of games he shot the Lakers out of winning against games he shot the team into the win over his career... I bet it's gonna be close right now, but it will only get worse the following years...
beeeoooppp::I was just trying to say it will get worse IF he continues to play this way, ignoring the flow and assets of his team. And I dont see any reason why he would suddenly change his $@%!$@%!$@%! mind.
elibird123::Man you guys are awesome, I mean would have ever, ever thought he would be worse as the years go on.
boom.shaka.::So you bet his skills will deteriorate as he gets older?  BRILLIANT!!!!
JK Belvi 2008::Then he should stop playing the way he plays! He needs to conform to what suits the team! Not his statistics or his legacy!   Now, that's BRILLIANT! Wait, I take that back - "THAT'S COMMON SENSE!"
JK Belvi 2008::Finally someone thinking about the present. I thought it would never surface...

boom.shaka.::More fun with stats - today's lesson, "career FG%"  Isiah Thomas - 45.2% Kobe - 45.3% Ray Allen - 45.3% Reggie Miller - 47.1%  In other words:  not the best ever but not nearly as bad as some would hope.
JK Belvi 2008::Sorry to burst your bubble here boom.shaka - but when you take the "number of shots" this guy launches, that 45% really doesn't look good at all. Where's Jordan's 49.7%
ACandOJ::You realize there is exactly one more made shot between those percentages??
boom.shaka.::Kobe's not Jordan.  Sorry to disappoint you.
bobbydagreat::But that's why Jordan is the GOAT though.
ZachC1965::That's about right...Kobe and Ray Allen/Reggie Miller are about equal...
boom.shaka.::All HOFers...sounds about right.
ACandOJ::Til you add in the fact that Jesus &amp; Reg never played any D
biggerandbetterthanyou::great point. I approve this message
biggerandbetterthanyou::lets see at season ends where kome is
biggerandbetterthanyou::Only pick one Kobe is a : 1) Chucker 2) ball stopper 3) ball pounder 4)all of the above 5) too old and slow and is only relevant when he gets on a hot streak ala mike bibby or joe johnson
ZachC1965::i'm torn between 4 and 5...
ZachC1965::"Don't get so wide open, your man double-teams me!!!"  Kobe, overhead yelling at a teammate...
beeeoooppp::that's exactly what I thought in the 4th Q
biggerandbetterthanyou::team mate yelling back: "kobe, you are a horrid chucker. we were playing well with you on the bench. GO AWAY old man"

klin121::I wonder if the kobster had shot 10 less and gasol 10 more, the end result would be the same....I mean gasol was on fire (10/14)...losing Bynum did not help though.
ACandOJ::If you're not stopping the other team...what difference does it make who is shooting??
ACandOJ::Not if you're trading 2's for 3's....
ZachC1965::Makes it even more important to get high-percentage shots...
ZachC1965::They should give Kobe the Least Valuable Player award now and get it over with. Can't believe how many games he has singlehandedly shot them out of...
Clenbutador::Not a coincidence that the lakers are 0-2 without Fisher.
ZachC1965::Getting rid of their only clutch player can't help...
boom.shaka.::Not a coincidence they gave up 100+ to Utah and Houston and lost.

ZachC1965::He's had soooo many 9 for 31 type of nights this year it's remarkable he's still starting. A drunken Steve Blake could go 10 for 31...
ZachC1965::Well I know Laker fans hate facts, but Kobe has been stinking it up night after night for several weeks now.  Sorry that the truth hurts, but Kobe's kind of a joke at this point...
ACandOJ::Several weeks?? A few weeks ago he shot over 50% while the Lakers went 6-2...including 61% vs the Heat
ZachC1965::Fair enough, but anyone still pushing for 'mvp' this year is high on crack...
boom.shaka.::Yep, but after 15.5 years of tearing it up, we're willing to cut him a little slack.
mhsmustang1::agreed.
Rajon_Krondo::Laker haters are like little kindergarden kids. They dont know what the f*ck they are saying and trolling them is hilarious.  The only reason i've been here for so long is that their pathetic excuses are hilarious.
