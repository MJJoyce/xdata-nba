openminded43::Why is Gortat playing only 28 miutes??? He had no fouls or foul trouble, he's your best front court player/defender and rebounder!!! No wonder he is being snubbed for the All Star game!!!
zachrlee::Michael Redd finally shows up.
Chris72077::As a bobcats fan I hate to see the suns suffering. I respect Nash so much and would love this team to go to a finals with him leading the way, just wish the owner would go out and get some players. I was honestly sad when the Suns lost to the lakers 2 years ago in the Western Finals was it? Sad day.
Chris72077::On another note I am so glad Diop is out and BB is starting C
Zach4panthers::Michael Redd? lol have not seen that name in years
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::YEAH!!! Good win PHX
allowishes8::F Kemba Walker
joest2003::ahahah
eaglesfan1723::Holy $@%! covered 2nd half by half a point. YEAHHHHHH
packers-are-numero_uno::why is there a question mark? its pretty straight foward.
eaglesfan1723::ok..?
packers-are-numero_uno::sucks to be an eagles fan
nickf1190::gotta play in ATL next, not really expecting a win from that one
packers-are-numero_uno::lol I love how Eddie Johnson just tells it as it is
packers-are-numero_uno::still wondering why the bobcats gave the suns J-Rich and Dudley for Diaw...
buckspackers23::J-Rich was on the Bobcats? Didn't he go from Golden State to Suns to Magic?
packers-are-numero_uno::no he went GS to Bobcats,  Suns, Magic
cb12490::when he wasn't eating twinkies he was servicable. j rich contract probably too much. also bell was in that deal.
Johnny the Deuce::I love when the lakers lose!
nickf1190::Wish we could draft a young solid replacement for hill next year
nickf1190::i hate the lottery system , if it went by record like the nfl we could probably get a 8-10 pick
packers-are-numero_uno::yeah but I guess it adds a little twist to it
packers-are-numero_uno::stop winning games and get a lottery pick
packers-are-numero_uno::"hes either injured or hes faking it because he shot an airball" -Eddie Johnson lmao
cb12490::I am a fan of quite possibly the worst team in NBA history...  at least we have Cam Newton...
StompYourFace25::I wonder if he has a decent jumpshot... MJ CALL HIM UP
Orange602::Newton should never be allowed to play football again after that performance
Orange602::He deserves to be stripped of that award. He embarrassed himself with his pro-bowl performance.
cb12490::offensive rookie of the year. keep hatin'...
Orange602::hahaha
packers-are-numero_uno::Fig Newton &gt; Cam Newton
cb12490::you should never be allowed to comment after such mindless drivel...
packers-are-numero_uno::yeahhhh he lost the probowl for the AFC... seriously how do you throw multiple interceptions against no defense?
packers-are-numero_uno::yeah thats what I meant.
cb12490::seriously how do you take the pro bowl so seriously? and by the way, it's NFC...
arizonasting001::Bobcats scoring by Quarter: 1st Q- 24. 2nd Q- 24. 3rd Q- 24. 4th Q- 6. LMAO
arizonasting001::Lopez with a career high, one dunk tonight!
Johnny the Deuce::he should be in the starting role with gortat for size, sit that brickmason frye since gentry is experimenting and all
buckspackers23::I don't really know why anyone drafted Bismack Biyombo.
Chris72077::The dude is like, give him time. He might be a solid bench player or maybe even a starter. We will see. It is gonna take some time though
Talentsojhin::He is a talent. Just raw.
arizonasting001::shows how bad last years draft class was.
eaglesfan1723::$@%! that had the 2nd half over. 3 $@%!$@% points? FOH
123212go::solution: don't gamble
arizonasting001::at least the bobcats will automatically have a top 3 pick and a couple nice young players to build around... we have a bunch of old men and bench players.
InfamousRickola::doesn't matter where the bobcats pick, mj will always find a bust
nickf1190::They certainly dont look nice now
Talentsojhin::I honestly hope it blows up in our face. I hate tanking on purpose.
arizonasting001::Henderson and Agustine are both out.
nickf1190::They should just send the bobcats to Seattle
Chris72077::Yeah, you just need to shut up. Im pretty sure anyone who isn't $@%!$@% $@%!$@%! could point to charlotte on a map
NAUJACKS11::I am a Suns fan, but I could not defend this idiotic statement. FYI look how many showed up to the Suns game.
Talentsojhin::Because they have a bad record? They are 14th out of 30 in league attendance still fyi....
nickf1190::1/2 the people in this country probably couldnt point to charlotte on a map, they might win 3-4 more games if their lucky
buckspackers23::I've been saying Redd should start, and he finally does. Look what he did tonight.
Johnny the Deuce::for real dudley may have lost his job
23germany::worst team ever. worst season ever  hope they never score again so that even the most american of fans can see what a nonsense it is to employ 30 teams
nickf1190::2 4th quarter points &amp; were 3/4 through the quarter, id be surprised if charlotte won another game this season
Allen4875::2 points in 8 minutes.     2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     I cant understand this.
arizonasting001::Everytime I think we are going to make a push for a top 5 pick we get a win.. I hate this, being around .500 isn't good, you miss the playoffs and get a worse pick in the draft. We NEED a top 5 pick, this team has no upside or potential at all.
Talentsojhin::Welcome to the last 5 seasons of Bobcat basketball...
ThiscantbeAwesomebeast222::DJ's going to want to bail.
Orange602::Looks like this is going to be another hiccup in the Suns' quest for a top 10 draft pick
arizonasting001::ho hum.
arizonasting001::get Lopez out! I hate seeing him succeed
Allen4875::2 $@%!$@% points in 6 minutes.   what $@%!$@% BS.    DISBAND THE TEAM
ThiscantbeAwesomebeast222::Feel bad for both of these fanbases, the real Heat fans (Like me ) had to deal with this for a few years.
arizonasting001::I dont think there is such thing as a real Heat fan.
nickf1190::i think we (Suns) might squeak out a near .500 season, definitely nothing to be proud of though
packers-are-numero_uno::yeah especially since they need a lottery pick in a loaded draft
packers-are-numero_uno::the Bobcats have a fanbase?
123212go::MEEEEEEEE!!!!!
ThiscantbeAwesomebeast222::They are a new franchise, they have their problems regarding fans...
nickf1190::what do you mean by younger team?
ThiscantbeAwesomebeast222::Well, the Suns, Bobcats are a younger team so....
Johnny the Deuce::Lopez doin work lol he's so uncoordinated he always trips on his clown feet
packers-are-numero_uno::wow Redd has 17 points so far
ThiscantbeAwesomebeast222::Dey Bak!
Allen4875::of course.    bye bye bobcats you losers
Johnny the Deuce::Jchill finally gettin some mins
JOE CARLS::just think if the Suns had a tougher schedule and didnt play so many SH*T teams we would be BANK in the LOTTO
Johnny the Deuce::yeah he can atleast play some D
arizonasting001::yeah, about time too. he has actually looked pretty good the last 5 games or so.
arizonasting001::I still dont understand how we have won 8 games this season.
JOE CARLS::LUCKY!
JOE CARLS::oh and NASH
arizonasting001::Only guys I care about anymore are Nash, Gortat and Morris.
packers-are-numero_uno::I think Shannon Brown is a good fit. give him more than this season
JOE CARLS::Nash ,Gortat,Morris /......................agreed!!
nickf1190::grant hill might be washed up but he can still bring it
arizonasting001::he has his moments.
Allen4875::critical turnover.   arghhhh..
ncderek13::The Bobcats have scored 24 in each quarter, lol
packers-are-numero_uno::lest go Suns
jasondean1909::I wonder if the Suns will cover the 10 point spread?  Ya think?=)
nickf1190::i thought i felt a comeback
bigdickjim::new dogs of nba .... SUNS
JOE CARLS::pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
ncderek13::Kemba will get 30 tonight
Bonzibuddi::it's hard when the rest of ur team sux
Allen4875::does it matter when they get a L?   nope.   all star KW aint
arizonasting001::pathetic Lopez.. dunk the damn ball
BNS224::Ya Sideshow Bob is a joke. In NBA 2K12 I put Warrick at PF b/c he DUNKS THE DAMN BALL.
Allen4875::lol worst team in the league has just arrived.
123212go::You need to be more specific
Orange602::Lol, Nash with the block
joest2003::lol at nash with 7 points and 4 turnovers=FAIL
Orange602::ok, he also has 10 assists
arizonasting001::HAHA.. Nash just blocked Kemba!!
BNS224::Nash better make the All-Star team. Leading the league in ast. w/ these guys at like 37 and another 50-40-90 season,come on. U put him w/ Griffin and Jordan or w/ Durant and he avg. like 12+ apg. I am a SPurs fan but mad props to Nash. Hope u run Jordan's Bobcats into the ground especially for trading G Wallace. Jordan = Baylor as far as worst GMs or OWNER whatever.
arizonasting001::agreed
bigdickjim::at home, struggling against the worst team in nba.. too funny
