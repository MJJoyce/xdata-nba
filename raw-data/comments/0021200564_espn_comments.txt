A Moveable Feast::The Sixers are trash again.  Doug Collins took them from trash to mediocrity and now back to trash.  What is the plan with this team?
MinniWolves90::Greivis Vasquez is one of the most underrated players in the game. This guy is going to be really good.
GeauxPelicans::look at da Pelicans, breakin the century mark. how bout it
Devinhuelsmann::Ha.
njhaines::Gordon's return is the obvious catalyst behind the improvement but; maybe Monty is evolving as a coach:  Bench Rivers &amp; Lance Thomas Let Aminu &amp; X. Henry play the 3 (No Lance Thomas or Darius Miller) Let Roberts and Roger Mason Jr. back up the guards.  (No Austin Rivers)  Don't waver Monty, you've found a rotation.
CGraceIII::That's the best rotation if you're trying to win games this season, but this is a team playing for two years from now. Monty has to continue to get Miller and Rivers minutes. If they aren't going to play much, they should be assigned to the D-league to get some run.
I.AM.Dynomite::I would like to see Rivers get a little burn.  Just to get his confidence up.  He's a young guy and I think he will be fine. He just has to learn how to play at this level.
2012 Mayans::Austin Rivers is playing awesome.
MD.Saints.Fan.::good work
dont-want-gay-in-a-clipp-uniform::as a clipper fan,im glad eric gordon is back
Living Room GM::mann sixers need willie green Back ASAP
Mumu8833::Yea, the North East has lots of stupid white women that need to be put out of our misery
jgillespie1210::Thank God the Flyers start Saturday.
Kerby5436::im surprised anyone saw this game
ganggreengaingreen_oww::i didnt watch any of the game but i will state my opinion anyway. jrue is a straight up baller and needs a better wingman than evan turner, or at least turner needs to learn how to help this team win and contribute as a role player. and im guessing davis pooped on our big men. its pretty clear that all it takes to beat us is a big man, but if u come at us with guards (any skill level) your gonna have a bad time, because jrue has your point guard on lock and ET plays tough D. lets stop foolin around
Verin15::Anthony wasn't the reason the Hornet's won, the Hornet's guards were.
letzmiller::You might want to check the stats of the Hornets starting guards before making that statement.....  I wouldn't call that "lock down."  Jrue had a great night offensively, I'll give him that.
onlyelement1::6-3 when they got gordon back in the lineup
letzmiller::...... and Gordon didn't even play in one of those losses.  They are 6-2 when he gets on the court.
DBrownDrose::what happened to the sixers
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::Hornets key to victory is not playing Austin Rivers
CoreyGallagherArt::Jrue is good, too bad nobody else on this team is. He is the only reason I can bear to even watch this team.
Flash Barrett::As a Bulls fan, everybody look at the Hornets record and jus think it's an easy win and not taking into account most of those losses came with Eric Gordon hurt
tarheel11104::The Hornets are a totally different team now that Austin Rivers is riding the bench
TexAugMan::Send him to the D-Leauge or trade him!
marcg33::" Do I really have to play with these guys?"- Jrue Holiday
binkinainteasy::Keep Jrue. Anyone else is expendable.
colaroaster::hornets in bostons a.ss tomorrow night
KnicksGiantsYankeesRangers::brittle knees bynum couldnt save this team
KnicksGiantsYankeesRangers::sixers really suck
marcg33::Does Philly still have an NBA team?
SoyMejorQueTu::GrandeGreivis!!!  ke todo...
I love hot moms.::Lets trade Bynum for Royce White.
Flash Barrett::Mumu8833 If he wants to prove he is the best coach ever he should coach a team that isn't stacked _______________________________________________________________________________________  Wat team did he coached that was stacked? And if that's the case shouldn't u say that about every coach besides Larry Brown, Rick Carlisle and Rudy T.?
xBudRadx::I'm a fan of Doug Collins
Mumu8833::He just b*tched John Mitchell.  Mitchell is a tool
GMEN.DYNASTY12::Austin Rivers for MVP and ROY
Terperoni::LOL!
picaac15::Somehow we're still only 4 1/2 GB of the 8 seed....  Maybe we need a new coach?
creeddude96@gmail.com::Its called being in the eastern conference
madmikey63::or better talent..or a better gm
GMEN.DYNASTY12::Phil Jackson?
madmikey63::he only coaches allstar lineup teams...jordan pippen shaq kobe..thats tough..overrated!!!
Mumu8833::If he wants to prove he is the best coach ever he should coach a team that isn't stacked
babyjamarcus::Vasquez has earned an all-star bid in my mind
Devinhuelsmann::your funny ^
lsutigerguy1::Anderson deserves a spot
derek_510::in the west?  hell no -____-  especially with that turnover to assist ratio
Amiketheo::Top 5 assist leaders in the NBA as of 01/16/13...  Rajon Rondo - 11.2 assists/game; 3.6 turnovers/game Chris Paul - 9.7 assists/game; 2.1 turnovers/game Greivis Vasquez - 9.1 assists/game; 3.3 turnovers/game Jrue Holiday - 8.8 assists/game; 3.9 turnovers/game Russell Westbrook - 8.4 assists/game; 3.4 turnovers/game  Vasquez is no worse, if not better in assist/turnover ratio, compared to any of these guys not named Chris Paul, who is well-known for being an elite ball-handler and passer.  If the argument is who in the west is better than Vasquez right now... Well, I think CP3 is the de facto #1 PG for the all-star team in the west, which is a given as most would agree. If you look at #2 and #3, then it comes down to two guys who are on fairly stacked teams in Russell Westbrook and Tony Parker...   Although, in my opinion, looking at what Vasquez has had around him in NO(especially prior to Eric Gordon returning), it could be said that he would have more production, assist numbers-wise, if he played on the Thunder or the Spurs. I would pick between Parker and Westbrook and then drop the other in favor for Vasquez or even Damian Lillard, who has had a surprisingly great rookie year so far.
onlyelement1::with all of his inconsistent play?
Amiketheo::Not trying to be "that" guy, but just looking at his last 10 games played on his profile page... It's kind of a stretch to call his play as "inconsistent"... In fact, it's anything but. He won player of the week like last week or the week prior(don't recall which).
Barry660314::Gordon will put up 30 tomorrow. FACT Obama was born in Kenya. FACT Austin rivers is a beast. BULL
Nodat1::You're right!  They all are clueless. Including some of the Democrats. Indeed you are too!!!
Devinhuelsmann::this is ESPN not C-SPAN go talk politics somewhere else
lsutigerguy1::Pretty straight forward.  Thumbs up!!!
Nodat1::Absolutely, I love our President!!!  But I do believe our country is screwed because of the House, Senate, Tea Party, and now the NRA!!!  In deed we are screwed.
Jaywashing::The Tea Party has like 10 Congressmen, the Senate is heavily Democratic, the Republicans are whimps, and you're clueless.
Nodat1::Cool. I agree!
Barry660314::Okay good I thought u liked Obama
Nodat1::R u still angry that Romney lost the election?
Barry660314::Not really. Our country is screwed though
Nodat1::Way to close it out Bees.  GEAUX HORNETS!!!
potato623::If our schedule goes the way it should, which it won't, at best we'll be 22-30 by the time Bynum gets here with 31 games to go....
depinach::yea but this team is clearly built around him. You gotta see what they can do with him on the floor. Anyway there are no moves they can make that will make them a great team this season. Keep Bynum, see what he can do for 30 games or so and make SMART moves in the offseason.
depinach::we got way too much invested in him to let him go
Belmagh::he can walk - he's on last year of his contract and can go anywhere this summer, free agent.
madmikey63::he has proven he's a part time player..knees will get worse before better...
madmikey63::bynum will get hurt..worst off season move ever...give up Andre for a guy who sits on bench then gets hurt bowling...cut ur ties and get rid of the overpaid benchwarmer
ehustle365::Playoffs'? (*Jim Mora Voice*)
potato623::So to make the playoffs we'd have to finish 19-12
potato623::And that's just for a 7th or 8th seed
PATSORGENOS2012::Back to the Gus bus
SoyMejorQueTu::y mañana vamos a matar los Celtics...#GrandeGreivis...
ehustle365::They play hard no doubt about it, but just like philly there will be no games left for them come May.
ehustle365::dont get too ahead of urself, this game vs Philly was not a Big Win..' Philly in the same boat as the Hornets.
SoyMejorQueTu::hung in with NY...and beat teams like San Antonio and Houston...we on the way up...youngest team in nba...we like OKC 3 or 4 yrs ago
.RupturedSpleen.::flagged for mexican.
SoyMejorQueTu::te mates
.RupturedSpleen.::Same difference.
SoyMejorQueTu::i'm Puerto rican fool...flagged for being a p.inche p.uta
paulleena12::Good.  Celtics will Beat Hornets in Next Game.
Flash Barrett::Every teams fans have said that...but have yet to realize since Gordon is back its not a cake walk against the Hornets
Barry660314::Lol okay.....
sj53178::Vasquez is flat beasting
.RupturedSpleen.::Like a mad pelican.
.RupturedSpleen.::Well, at least the sixers started out 9-5.
mojart::geaux hornets.....make it back to back win tomorrow
Barry660314::Rondo&gt;vasquez Gordon&gt;bradley Pierce&gt;aminu Garnett&gt;DA BROW Lopez&gt;Boston center
Barry660314::SHOULD BE A GOOD ONE
Gage5662::Soooo freaking frustrating being a Sixers fan.....

PhiliFan05::I hope you mean December 1st or your math skills suck.
potato623::Couldn't ecven get the fans big macs...wow 6ers
Barry660314::This is a funny score
erinbaby1997::Great another loss
saintswhoaday::shout out to Xavier Henry
IggyIsClutch::Doug is a good teacher but he is a horrible playmaker and motivator. We need a new coach
Mumu8833::He's good in every department but talent evaluation.  Shoulda kept Lou and not taken Swaggy.  Our bench would be much better with Lou there
saintswhoaday::way to play hornets
the 1racer::night everyone! time for some college bb
