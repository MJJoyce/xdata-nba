joest2003::27 Minutes for Walker? WTF?
nhraven52::We'll just refer to the Celtics as, #23.....
Jimmy30313::We'll just refer to the heat as a gimmick team
Jimmy30313::haha good one. Is that Miami's excuse when they lose to Boston?
nhraven52::Bobcats played down to the opponent.
Chestnut Trill::?
Celtics own the heat.::was reading comments and i pretty sure all the "analysts" have said that bynum will get a max contract from someone. the Cs can't afford him, sorry.
oblique15::why would we want him? to see him sitting down? yeah that sounds like fun!
Jimmy30313::We dont want him
Chestnut Trill::bynum is a meltdown.
Chestnut Trill::how come KG didnt play
nhraven52::Too many push ups.
Jimmy30313::lol I bet you were mad about that
Jimmy30313::Adductor strain
Jimmy30313::Adductor strain
Chestnut Trill::celtics were 1 pt away in the 4th qtr for the 1st wire to wire win this year....son of a bee sting
Jimmy30313::They took the foot of the peddle a bit in the 4th
Jimmy30313::Asomuhga to the Saints, I hope that happens
nhraven52::Celtics found way past Bobcats LMAO
CelticPatriot17::what's scheduled is scheduled. take it one game at a time honey.
Celtics1634::And half the ravens starters have found their to other teams LMAO!
PP owns Rondo::Test
Celtics1634::lame
Celtics1634:::)
meats29::The Celtics lost the last 6 games that Rondo played in and then won 7 in a row after he got hurt They lost their last 3 home games that Rondo played in. They are 11-0 at home since Rondo got hurt. 20-23 before Rondo injury 16-6 after Rondo injury  That really is crazy
Shaun0088::No Celtics player made no more the 5 FG attempts and they still scored 105 points.Balance.
EastLondonE2::Congrat's fake pikies you beat the the Bobcats woo hoo
habs fans cant stop me::anyone still here
Celtics1634::Are you even still here?
American League Championship Series 2004::So much for "not being able to beat the worst team in the league"  Now calm down kiddies. You lose.
habs fans cant stop me::76ers big losers of the dwight howard trade
habs fans cant stop me::gso just beat diaz
nba4life2013::"When Bynum hits free agency this summer, some team will pay him, though probably at an injury discount price. It's hard to see the Sixers making a strong push to re-sign Bynum (unless he'll take a one-year deal)"  deadspin #1 source for sports TRUTH! http://deadspin.com/5987925/andrew-bynum-will-probably-never-play-a-game-as-a-sixer
nba4life2013::he won't confirm or deny anything because he's going to be a free agent this year...... Why would he come out and say that now?  but they say its most likely the case that's why Doug Collins is having a mental breakdown all season lol
habs fans cant stop me::bynum looks like hes only geting one year deal
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I would happily take Bynum at the discounted price.  don't think he would sign with us.  Think he would get a better offer elsewhere.  Goodnight though.
nba4life2013::GOODNIGHT
nba4life2013::So knowing he's going to be available at a discounted price...  this is the piece Ainge should go after.  It's a perfect combination of PG/Center.  If it doesn't work out C's just sign someone else after all star break or after the season.  Kinda like the Colts willing to tank a season to get Luck.  It's just smart business,  if i'm ainge i want Bynum NOW!
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Of course I would admit that. I think Bynum is the best center in the game today.
nba4life2013::how bout you admit if bynum could be healthy,  Rondo + Bynum = domination
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::We're only on the same page if you confirm that you pay attention to tmz.espn sources.
nba4life2013::we're on the same page now.  goodnight
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::He has to take a physical before a contract would be validated.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::That clearly states he's going to make a little above league minimum.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I'm pretty sure that's just a rumor at this point. Has it been confirmed by Bynum???
nba4life2013::yes he is.  Where have you been dude?  DEGENERATIVE KNEES is exactly what Roy had.  Is Roy playing today?  No!  From superstar to retired at like 28 bro...
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::You're missing the point. Bynum isn't like Roy or Oden.
nba4life2013::and tyson chandler was considered a bust and a nobody when he was injured (he's a rare case that came back to 100%)    i'm saying take a chance on bynum cus he could do the same.  well worth it. and he would definitely like to come to Boston b/c he would have Rondo
nba4life2013::injury discount price.  that's what you sign Brandon Roy, Greg Oden, Tyson Chandler, etc... you sign them for next to nothing to give them a chance.  Makes perfect sense for the Celtics to give him a shot.  Rondo gets 12 assists a game throwing to shooters.  Imagine if he had a healthy bynum in the paint.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::How did I get owned? He'll sign a one year deal for 15M.
nba4life2013::he'll get a 1 year deal from someone, but he won't take philly's offer. he don't wanna play there.  and your b/s about max-contract is just silly.  so you can keep believing you're right, but you got owned.  peace

Jimmy30313::KG now is better than Bosh in his prime
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Bosh is a fourth option most of the time. He's on the wrong team. I like him. He just doesn't fit the Heat offense.
nba4life2013::UK is a 12 year old
nba4life2013::So you would sign max contract $15M+ to a guy who:  Says he can't play. Has not played. Gets hurt every season. Shows no interest in playing for you.   Doctors now saying his career could be over.  Hmm...  My money says Philly cuts ties with Bynum before June
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Bottom line. 15M
nba4life2013::Bynum is available.  bottom line... free agent
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I never said I would sign him to anything. I said someone will pay him big $$$.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Bynum will sign for league minimum  -NBAforlifesince2013
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Yes he will.
nba4life2013::Bynum is going to be a free agent....  He can choose where he wants to play.  And no,  he will not get a Franchise 15M dollar offer from ANY team in the league.  He's in vegetable status man.  Wake up
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Are you new to this? You don't think a GM like Morey is going to pay Bynum his $$$? There are approximately three to five quality centers in the league. People are willing to take that chance.
nba4life2013::I'm 25.  Seems your numbers are always way off kid.  Bynum 15M next year.... LMFAOROFL

UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::At least you're taking my grammar lessons to heart. You might not be as dumb as you sound.
nba4life2013::I didn't say that.... I said sign him for close to the min.  because they seriously don't think he'll play in the NBA anymore.  "UK:   he will 100% sign for a 15million dollar contract next year"  You're an idiot kid
Canes n Heat::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3KkWrry8f4
Canes n Heat::Hey boston fans just wanted to know if you guys remember my boy James Jones drilling those three's against you guys in the 2011 playoffs, anyone else remember?
Jimmy30313::Haha, at least boston have true fans. Heat fans would probably be disappointed  if they went to a game and Lebron didnt have a highlight dunk or drop 40,and they win
Canes n Heat::Just keep letting Danny stir them trade rumors around with rondo like he did with ray, players love that from a organization.
Jimmy30313::Ray left because he didnt like Rondo.
Canes n Heat::Ya i bet you said the same thing about Ray before he left
Jimmy30313::Rondo leave Boston? No way he's a Celic for life
Canes n Heat::Ya i wonder if you will be saying that when he leaves Boston in a few years like ray did.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I only remember Rondo coming back out after the assassination attempt. Nothing more. He's a trooper and plays with heart.
Canes n Heat::Another excuse! Left and right they keep coming!
Jimmy30313::Ive heard the "We didnt have Bosh for 3 games excuse  a few times
Canes n Heat::I like competitive games considering we have eliminated Boston from the playoffs the last 2 years.
Jimmy30313::You ignore them as "excuses" but every one except heat fans will tell you that that series was BS
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::You saw what happened. Don't call it an excuse. It was a blatant attempt to injure a player. Wade is a dirty pig.
Canes n Heat::Hey wait look everyone! Look! Another excuse, someone get NBA Memes "Beware the Boston fans excuses are coming"
Jimmy30313::haha 2011 wade in his infinite wisdom took Rondo out of the series so we were never going to win that. And in 2012; Game 2 (nuff said)
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Don't bring up the first year when Wade went Tonya Harding on Rondo.
Canes n Heat::Thats why Pierce was able to make the all star team right.
Jimmy30313::UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown - Please don't use making an AS game in any argument.  He's a heat fan. He likes spectacles more than competitive games
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Please don't use making an AS game in any argument.
Canes n Heat::Coaches pick the bench players you know, and normally fyi the good players get voted in hence "All star game"
Jimmy30313::All star game is a popularity contest
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Yeah, because the fans vote and all.
Canes n Heat::Lets see here Kg averages 14 and 7 with paul pierce on his team, Bosh averages 17 and 7 with wade and lebron on his team, ya your so right Kg is dominating this season bosh sucks im so sorry
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Paul Pierce is our best player. Arguably, I would say Bradley is our second best at this point.
Canes n Heat::Clearly not rondo is for sure, but last time i checked he tore his ACL so atm Kg is your best player.
Jimmy30313::Canes n Heat - Thats great we are not comparing careers are we? Trying to change the subject again, we were comparing matchups and seasons i thought, Again cant accept the fact Miami's 3rd best player is better then Boston's current best player.  lol what a joke. Pierce, Rondo and KG are all better than Bosh
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::KG isn't our best player.
Canes n Heat::Must be a total role player dude id like to see KG average 14 with Wade and Lebron,battier,allen... the list's goes on dude the heat are deeper then the ocean itself.
Canes n Heat::Thats great we are not comparing careers are we? Trying to change the subject again, we were comparing matchups and seasons i thought, Again cant accept the fact Miami's 3rd best player is better then Boston's current best player.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::So a guy in his prime plays more minutes than a guy at the end of his career and only averages three more points?   Hmmm. Seems like a role player.
Jimmy30313::Call me if Bosh is half as good as KG at 37
Canes n Heat::just did bosh averages 3 more minutes per game then kg
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Might want to look at minutes champ.
Canes n Heat::Wade sucked? Ok clearly you did not watch the Finals.
Jimmy30313::Wade is overrated and dirty
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Yes, I did. He won that one game and called it "his" team. After that, not much.
Canes n Heat::Boston fans would know about choking right? *cough 2012 playoffs cough* *cough 2010 nba finals cough*
Jimmy30313::Right now they are. This era will pass soon enough. Lebron wont stay in Miami after 2014 I dont think
Canes n Heat::Ya and they are the better team sorry.
Jimmy30313::The decade is 3 years old....
Canes n Heat::Thats great Since 2006 we have won 2 Titles been to the show 3 times, Stats speak for it self. Clearly Miami is the better team of the Decade.
Canes n Heat::Ya we also had Lebron James on our team, you know the guy who dropped 40+ against your team in game 6, 30 in the first half.
Jimmy30313::Yeah they suck. 6 Atlantic titles in a row, a title, 2 finals appearances and 3 ECF appearances in the last 5 years
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::So we suck and went seven games against your team that has the refs in their pockets???
Canes n Heat::You had a 2 game lead dude you lost at home horribly that's choking.
Canes n Heat::Again more and more excuses Boston fans just cant accept the fact that they suck
Jimmy30313::Choking implies that you were the better team and lost. Are you saying that we should have won in 2012
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::2012 Playoffs: We overachieved and Joey Crawford showed up.  2010 Playoffs: Horribly reffed second half. Atrocious.
Canes n Heat::If i recall we played you before the break? Every one who actually watches the Nba knows the heat dont give two shts about the regular season, and when they want to win they do and the streak is there to prove it, Let me save you the favor Boston fans, go and buy your tissue boxes in advance so you wont have to wait in line with all of the other fans from Boston on Monday night.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Dirk was fine. But LBJ and Wade sucked which led to the loss.
Jimmy30313::Canes n Heat - You really think Kg would start over Bosh? Please Kg is having one of the worst season's in his career, again delusional fans.  KG's worst season is better than Bosh's best season
Canes n Heat::I guess Dirk just sucked then right.
Canes n Heat::You really think Kg would start over Bosh? Please Kg is having one of the worst season's in his career, again delusional fans.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Don't give Dirk credit. Your team choked.
Canes n Heat::Point made before the break
Canes n Heat::No Give Dallas credit Dirk was on a Mission, no excuse for that series, so here unlike celtic fans i dont give excuses.
Jimmy30313::It was about 2 weeks before the break....
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I guess they didn't want to win against Dallas then.
Canes n Heat::Excuses excuses excuses keep them coming Boston fans thats all you have had the last few years, Bradley does not match up with Wade and we all know Green does not Match with Bosh.
Jimmy30313::Canes n Heat - Role player, K sure he would only start on the Celtics im sure he wouldnt be considered a role player then.  No way he starts in place of KG. He would come off the bench
Canes n Heat::Role player, K sure he would only start on the Celtics im sure he wouldnt be considered a role player then.
Canes n Heat::K jimmy that is were we draw the line. Again Delusional Celtic fans.
Jimmy30313::Bosh is a role player at best
Jimmy30313::haha typical dumb heat fan. Bradley dominates Wade
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Matched up well last time if memory serves me right.
Jimmy30313::lol he sucked toward the end of last year. I liked Ray, but he really would not have made a difference this season
Canes n Heat::Ray having a bad year? Ya ok, only has hit like 5-10 game winners, that sucks right. Keep telling yourself Boston can compete maybe they will come within 10 game of Miami instead of 14.
Jimmy30313::Canes n Heat - Game 2? Ya how about that game we won that game aswell... woooooo, If bosh was in the entire series Miami wins in 5 sorry Boston and you know it aswell.  Bradley didnt play at all, Green didnt play at all. Allen and Pierce both were injured. And game 2 was rigged. Might I add that KG would have dominated Bosh's overrated @ss
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Yeah you won game 2 but it wasn't exactly a fair win. Wade punched Rondo in the face on that drive.
Jimmy30313::jackedwrestler - whatever helps you sleep at night...keep tellin yourself that...  keep telling yourself that Ray is playing well with the heat. Keep telling yourself the Celtics werent robbed last year. Whatever helps you sleep at night
Canes n Heat::Game 2? Ya how about that game we won that game aswell... woooooo, If bosh was in the entire series Miami wins in 5 sorry Boston and you know it aswell.
jackedwrestler::whatever helps you sleep at night...keep tellin yourself that...

suchita36::But you can not give max contract to Josh Smith.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Agreed. But he might sign for less. He loves the C's.
nba4life2013::I say pick up the vegetable Andrew Bynum for literally no money, maybe league minimum.  Then if he comes back strong, now you got the best Center in the league and the best PG.  Now that would be a smart gamble... because it doesn't cost you anything and it could lead to a championship
nba4life2013::now you just sound a little kid or a female trying to argue for no reason.  Look how dumb you look... 15M to a guy they wonder if he'll ever be able to play again.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Says the guy who thinks that what he's heard all year is that Bynum is worth 800K
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::It's almost like you don't get it. Get Bynum for league minimum??? Are you crazy?
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::He will 100% sign a 15 M/Year or higher contract.
nba4life2013::No he will not.  Out of the question.  He's greg oden status right now with those knees.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Please don't use "your" an idiot and think I can take your insults seriously.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::All they are saying is that he doesn't deserve a max contract. He'll sign for about fifteen mil/year next year.
nba4life2013::Anyways,  you can't help that your an idiot when it comes to Talent and Math.  You think dope heads like Smith are franchise players...  and we'll leave it at that
nba4life2013::Even if it's more than league minimum, maybe a few million more, C's got plenty of salary cap room to make a smart gamble like that.  Unlike Josh nobody
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Never heard that. You must be misunderstanding.
nba4life2013::Every analyst on NBA TV,  TNT, and Magic Johnson and those guys have all said it.  More than once....  it's been a story all year.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Show me one link.
nba4life2013::That's what they're saying... not me.  They say no one will sign him right now for anything more.  So boston could easily get him cus he'd play with Rondo
jackedwrestler::do you feel that? its getting real hot all of a sudden  must be the heat
Canes n Heat::Breaking news: Sudden change in weather in Boston the weather is suddenly HEATing up
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Josh Smith needs the right coach. He can be a superstar.
Jimmy30313::Needs the right coach, and if KG is on his team he'll be OK
nba4life2013::yeah but he makes these mistakes like he's smoking weed or something.  Just silly errors.  His head is some where else.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Thank you.
nba4life2013::If you really think that i feel bad for you
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::If you really think that, I feel bad for you.
nba4life2013::That'll never happen.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I don't need you to feel bad. Just accept that he'll likely be a Celtic next year.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I want this starting line up next year. Rondo Bradley Green Smith KG
nba4life2013::Josh Smith?  Get out
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Thanks for your input.
nba4life2013::Never once has Smith given me the impression he feels like being on the court.

UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Is kicked butt a seven game series? Hmmm... Must have joined in after the finals.
BigBabyHonzo::this is why everyone hates heat fans smh^
Paulvo::because everyone hates a winner?
SPORTS-TALK- 1-ON-1::Vermin_cain - Really, fans of all the other teams have been hating on the Heat...They will probably win the next 2 or 3 championships so deal with it...  Fail
Vermin_cain::Really, fans of all the other teams have been hating on the Heat...They will probably win the next 2 or 3 championships so deal with it...
BigBabyHonzo::Celtics fans lets all go to TD garden and protest the wealth inequality in this country!
colaroaster::celtics owners also ceo's at bain capital ;)
Paulvo::Bain Capital formerly run by Mitt Romney - another loser
BigBabyHonzo::WAOOW. whos with me??? FOR THE PEOPLE in the wise words of vladamir putin
Paulvo::When are the Bobcats ever turn the franchise around - maybe its the management and not the players???Maybe MJ should return to being a shoe salesman?
Vermin_cain::Jordan needs to let other people with the know how make decision on  personnel. MJ doesn't know anything about talent, he should just be the owner...
PenguinFarts::Bobcats need to start buying and selling and taking risks. They wont ever change their franchise. It may take a year or two or even three but its better to start now
SPORTS-TALK- 1-ON-1::Lmao
SPORTS-TALK- 1-ON-1::I got to give  it up to Boston ,without rondo they're playing much better ,and moved up to 4th seed  Boston will end heat streak
PenguinFarts::Yeah. Maybe they are better off shooting the ball instead of having a mad passer. But I still like Rondo though. Anyways, I hope we beat the heat
SPORTS-TALK- 1-ON-1::Me too
BigBabyHonzo::rondo for pau gasol and earl clark
Paulvo::more like Pau Gasol and "Clark Kent"
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Quit
BigBabyHonzo::TD garden also needs to revamp their seating. My seat broke midway and i got moved to upper bowl section 350. I had section 113. smh
PenguinFarts::They shouldnt make a new stadium. TD Garden is full of memories and us Celtics fans are loyal to it. It's like cutting down the wall at Fenway
Justin 1717::i read this and a felt a painful sensation,...
PenguinFarts::Well everything cost money y'know
colaroaster::BigBabyHonzo - They need to build a new stadium. I heard they may build one in 2020  wyc deserves his own barn
BigBabyHonzo::They need to build a new stadium. I heard they may build one in 2020
BigBabyHonzo::TD garden need to revamp the washrooms. i was at todays game and wowww someone didnt pull the flush and it overflowed into the womens washroom
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::thats crazy
BigBabyHonzo::yeah man HUGE lineup. was any1 else at the game? maybe they can speak on this
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::go celts
habs fans cant stop me::when we beat miami we will finaly shut up the hat fans and the heat trols
Paulvo::If you view ending the streak instead of winning the NBA championship as a goal then Boston has a Chance.
Vermin_cain::Really? Did you Celtics fans shut your pie hole, after the Heat beat you in the playoffs the last two years?
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::No  Year one: Wade maims Rondo  Year two: See game 2.
PenguinFarts::If we beat Miama, they just going to call it a "lucky" win
Paulvo::and it will be true...
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::They'll say the regular season doesn't count and to see the last two years of the playoffs.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::They won't shut up.
PenguinFarts::So how bout that airline food?
BigBabyHonzo::IN SOLIDARITY. 29 teams against the heat.    In Kobe, Durant, KG, etc we TRUST
Vermin_cain::King James and the Heat will triumph over all of them...
BigBabyHonzo::kobe&gt; prince james mamacita
BigBabyHonzo::we need to trade rondo for 3 first rounders and john wall
