orange_63::Does Gilbert know he is losing fans.......like for reals
DatGuy8921::I hope this Booze Cruise doesn't stop anytime soon.
BEN DEVINE::Booze cruise playing like an all star this year!
straub42::Woah! Didnt know the Bulls were magic. In the second half, they made Tristan Thompson disappear!
Good sport333::I would hate to see the establishing of Kyrie as a top tier playing at the exspense of the Cavalier organization.  When they blow up then he blow up not vice versa this aint the 80's they dont need u
Good sport333::2 Dukies &gt;1 kryie
CubsBulls555::I can't wait for The Return. This is even more exciting than seeing Scal dominate the end of games.
Good sport333::now thats crunch for bulls fans when all 12 players score
parafal::Now if Boozer and Gibson could just be more consistent night in and night out...
sedin_sisters_have_fake_beards::What about day games? :)
showstopperinthebronx::I started betting a system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made around 3K a month for 3 consecutive months now using this system. You can find this system on the 1st page of Google by searching for Sports Betting Systems.
I Believe You Have My Stapler_::Boozer was a defensive machine,tonight
YenxRenx::Wow! kyrie $h.it the bed again!! what a surprise!!!!! lmfao
DatGuy8921::Kyrie is actually very talented.  He just came across a Bulls team that knows of his talents and made sure he stayed honest.  He is unfortunately stuck in Cleveland that's undoing him.
team kyle1::If he's so bad than why does he lead the ppg category for pg?
godfather67898@gmail.com::Becasue Derrick Rose is out
Good sport333::time-released talents
Good sport333::wait til 2015, he will be the best pg in the game
sedin_sisters_have_fake_beards::Gonna be alot of players retiring......to get to this point.
rrr2847::There you go bulls fans, daequan cook playing a grand total of 2 MINUTES in a blowout against a horrible cavs team. This guy will be cemented at the the very end of the bench by thibs as he continues to play his starters 500 minutes a game.
mccoywajmu::Rip Marco and Butler all play his position? lmao
Kit Ramsey::Dude he has 3 players in front of him, what the hell are u talking about?
FoxKat93::Isn't that exactly what a lot of Cavaliers use to laugh at the Bulls fans a few years ago? Then the bulls got better. ========== Well, the Bulls have won more than 2 playoff games in 10 years. Also, as good as the team is, I think that the Bulls are better. With the Knicks, usually, if you contain one player, another will go off. The Bulls seem to contain the offense--the 3 point and penetration as well as containing Chandler.
shut the front door please::Joakim Noah on the SEC: "It just shows the superiority of the conference. I feel like the SEC Championship is usually the two best teams."  You might not wanna say that while you're in Chicago, Jo...not right now anyway
Kit Ramsey::In football, but not in basketball.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Well I mean out of that unit Korver was the best Kit Ramsey
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Nate, Marco, and TAJ are all good offensive players off the bench. Last year Korver was are best and Taj didn't develop his game this much last year
YogaBeer::Well hey bulls fans.   Good talking with you.    Gotta hit the hay for now.     Best wishes to you as you move forward.    Talk with you the next time our teams meet.   Hopefully I'll be able to keep this posting name that long.
Kit Ramsey::Korver was our best? U mean the one who couldn't get his shot off because he can't create his OWN shot.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::yea in 2011 our Defense was excellent but we had Bogans and Ronnie brewer at the SG position. Those guys could not hit an open shot to save their life
DatGuy8921::Bulls do team defense, not individual defense.  Yes, the Bulls do have talented players on D, but more often than not, you hear the Bulls yell out (help! help! help!) when a drive is going to the hoop, so Jo or Booze or Taj can provide back up.
imagine606::Bulls defense is so much more a sum of the parts than it is any single defense. Bogans and Brewer were guys who came in as defenders. They may have been valuable in the beginning as far as being guys to build that defense with, but now everyone else on the team knows that defense, and it's established on the team. Belinelli is not a good defender, but he plays defense well on this team because of that system.  I should say that the point is that they can feel safe with offensive guys on that bench with only a few defenders on the floor at any time (and really in the starting lineup too).
YogaBeer::This is Exactly why a young team like the Cavaliers can be exploited in 2nd halves of games.     When the veteran team/coach makes adjustments, the rookie Cavs simply don't have that team D yet.   They don't know what to do even when told during a TO.    Team D is where it's at.   It's fun to see a dominant Defensive player during games, but if the rest of them, including when the starters get a blow, can't defend, those star Defenders mean nothing.
imagine606::Oh yeah, by far. He's a seriously legitimate offensive threat at the 2 off the bench.
Kit Ramsey::And he's a better scorer than both of them combined.
Kit Ramsey::Last years bench was built for the regular season, this bench is built for all the marbles because they can score.
FoxKat93::Ronnie can't even point up 2 points anymore.
YogaBeer::I still think it's a very good D.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Kit Ramsey you think the Bulls are NBA Finals material right now? Are do we need another star? I would say yes, but Dallas won a couple of years ago with only 1 Star so...
DatGuy8921::The Knicks will be a contender no doubt.  Nobody gets 1st place by being lazy.  That said, the Knicks are suspect in  the playoffs, and until then, that doubt will still be on that team.  As for the Cavs, they got a long, long way to go to even talk about playoffs let alone win games.
YogaBeer::The most difficult thing, IMHO, the Bulls have to be careful of is they are known (from other NBA fans) as one of the top defensive teams in the league.    If you go get a shooter that could mess up a good thing.    I'd say No to a star, but trade for a player you think can help on both ends w/o giving up too much.   I don't think Chicago is far from the best in the East at all as it is.    You add Rose to the mix... a healthy Rose and the Bulls and Knicks are the best in the East.
YogaBeer::Why the hostility?  You feel threatened by anything I wrote?   If you think staring at 1990's trophies is going to help make the knicks disappear, all the power to you.
Kit Ramsey::Dude the Bulls have 6 trophy's to stare at, what have the Cavs and Knicks have to stare at?
YogaBeer::IN fact, the coach of THAT team is now ruining the Lakers.
YogaBeer::Isn't that exactly what a lot of Cavaliers use to laugh at the Bulls fans a few years ago?    Then the bulls got better.
Kit Ramsey::The Knicks have won how many playoff games in the last 5 years?
YogaBeer::* plus, for that matter, as bad as the CAvaliers are now, they've owned the Knicks.   But every team has it's problem teams.   I realize the Knicks are your enemy at this point, but I'm looking at it w/o those rose colored fan glasses.   Not trying to knock your opinion as we all have those glasses for our own teams.
YogaBeer::I think you underestimate them during the regular season.   It all changes during post season.
Kit Ramsey::Dude the Knicks aren't even close to being the best, the Heat own them and the Bulls own them.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::No Kit, i'm just saying do you think the Bulls need another "Star" to win, or is this roster good enough as constructed?
Kit Ramsey::No they don't, they just need players who are smart and play with confidence.
Kit Ramsey::What star are u talking about? There are NO stars that's worth a damn that are available.
YogaBeer::The lakers are yet another example that you do NOT need to put a bunch of "stars" on the floor to win games.
Kit Ramsey::And i heard some fans talk about trading for ballhogging O.J. Mayo, lmao, that dude is jacking up more shots than ANY 2 guard in the league, (except for Kobe) and he has a disease that's called; i can't pass the ball to any teammate, lol.
CandySparker::Goo Goo Boozer! Carlos Goo!
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Noah and Booz will kill Miami on the glass and now we actually have 2 good SG's that can score. That will be the difference
YogaBeer::All the power to Boozer, but this was not a good game to judge Play Off talent with.   In fact, during the 1st half, Tristan Thompson man handled him.   In the 2nd half, Bulls designed plays to put Tristan away from the ball movement.    Zeller was caught with his pants down like 15 times in a row with that triangle like passing.
imagine606::Yeah, he played even better against the Heat, which is a better playoff test. I understand the negativity towards him, but now isn't the time for it.
FoxKat93::No, he has been consistently playing well, which is the point.
imagine606::If Boozer plays in the playoffs like he has these last few games for the Bulls, he may be able to redeem himself in the eyes of Bulls fans.
CandySparker::Boo Boo Boozer! Carlos Boo!
imagine606::3 straight very good games from him. Credit has to go where credit is due.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::The crazy thing is I really like our chances to reach the Finals when Rose comes back. But we are really playing with House Money because we will only get better in the next couple of years
imagine606::I don't expect it by any means, but I do have some hope.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::As long as we have Rose and Tibs we will be Contenders every year. After the drought after the 90's the Bulls are BACK for good!
Good sport333::true
imagine606::Agreed, at least for another 8-10 years they will be a team that everyone will take very seriously.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::http://youtu.be/e04uyfgVgjY
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::watchDreplay you guys say this every year. Bulls are built for the regular season, not the playoffs. Energy will only get you so far, look at the cavs w/ lebron.  Every year?? Umm last year Rose went down so that really didn't count and in 2011 the Bulls were "Inexperienced". That's not "Every year"
Big Mort::People forget Rose wasn't the only injury either. That Bulls team was decimated at multiple positions by playoff time.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::imagine606 The way I look at it, the Bulls may get that Charlotte draft pick, Mirotic coming over, and Rose entering his prime all within a year or two of each other.  Rose, Noah, Mirotic, Possible Star with that draft Pick?   O MY!! We got a BRIGHT Future
Kit Ramsey::The future will be the Bulls because of those deals, and Miami, Boston, the Lakers will be in the lottery or mediocre.
imagine606::Exactly. The Lakers may possibly be a sinking ship at this point, and Wade is going to be around 32 or 33 by that point, and since his jumper hasn't evolved much, if at all, and his style of play, he won't be the same D-Wade we've seen so far in his career. He looks like he might already be fading. LeBron will still be very good, and Bosh will have better opportunities and will likely be more effective with a fading Wade, but the Heat won't be the same Heat.  Of course, LeBron may be seeing this, and realize that he can opt out after next season, seeing the money the Bulls have available and might want to go ring chasing, agreeing to play the 4. However, that's EXTREMELY unlikely. Anyway, the cap space, Mirotic, and the Charlotte pick do make things look much sunnier than they may seem right now for the Bulls.
imagine606::Well, one negative is that Noah will probably be around 30-32 at that time. Also, Mirotic isn't a sure thing, but all of the signs point up for him right now. I'm hoping for Dirk/Peja (prime Peja) light.
DatGuy8921::Players are usually still priming at 30-32.  By this time their overall bball IQ makes up for the loss of a step, but with today's trainers, even a lost step at that age is a rarity.
Kit Ramsey::Now u see what Gar Forman and Pax are doing, not putting all eggs in one basket for 1 year.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Is anybody in here really FEAR Miami?? Or has your opinion in the last couple of Months changed as far as the Bulls beating them
DatGuy8921::I respect them, but not fear them.
imagine606::You still have to respect them, hate them or not, they demand respect still.
orange_63::i don't care who beats them as long as someone beats them!
ddx27::im going to cringe everytime d.rose does some crazy layup when he comes back from the injury
Kit Ramsey::I wish people stop this crap, let that man play. HIS knee and his career is not yours or anybody else's.  Too much negativity.
imagine606::I agree, and I trust the doctors, but I'll still probably stop breathing for a second or two after every acrobatic move he makes. It's just going to be natural.
imagine606::I probably will for at least the first 10-15 games.
Kit Ramsey::Where's all those; the Bulls should tank fans? Lol. Don't be surprised if they are the 2 seed after the season. And the best part is they still have Charlotte's pick and Mirotic.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Bulls could very well be in the Finals this season. Miami is very VULNERABLE and nobody takes the Knicks seriously
imagine606::To be honest, I hope you're wrong as far as injuries go, I'd like to see the Bulls beat the Heat at full strength, but at the same time the Bulls have had legitimate reasons the last 2 seasons for their shortcomings.
Kit Ramsey::Injury's always derail the Bulls, don't worry the Heat have theirs coming.
watchDreplay::you guys say this every year. Bulls are built for the regular season, not the playoffs. Energy will only get you so far, look at the cavs w/ lebron.
ddx27::when the hell is mirotic coming
imagine606::Especially when you also consider that the Bulls will have around $30 million in cap space to work with after next season assuming they amnesty Boozer. If they trade Boozer they can't open up that cap room though since a player has to have been on the roster when the last CBA was approved in order to be amnestied.
Kit Ramsey::^^ That's why i don't want ANY deals that involve getting rid of those.
imagine606::The way I look at it, the Bulls may get that Charlotte draft pick, Mirotic coming over, and Rose entering his prime all within a year or two of each other.
Kit Ramsey::20015 for sure and 20014 if they are willing to pay the exit fee for him.
imagine606::2014/15 at earliest.
orange_63::notre dame stinking as bad as the cavs..............
DatGuy8921::Remember when Saban left Miami like a crook?  Good times.
Lewis09Gomez::you mean Lakers? -__- Dame fans were too hyped up before this game just like laker fans were before the season and look at them now -.-
Lewis09Gomez::Sike!!, they hired the wrong coach. Made everything worst
orange_63::i thought they fixed that when they fired mike brown?
ddx27::nick saban is a legend. he will go down as one of the greatest college coaches of all time
imagine606::True, but he still got those recruits, which is a big part of any college coach's job. I don't like the guy at all, but I'll give credit where credit is due.
Kit Ramsey::Please, take away all those 5 star recruits and he couldn't win in the Mac.
orange_63::damn, I keep forgetting to watch the cavs...............did I miss anything good?
ddx27::marco&gt;korver
Lewis09Gomez::I think he was fantastic when D. Rose was on the floor
imagine606::He was good, but he was too streaky. That's one of the problems that you get with guys who are just jump shooters. Belinelli is a guy who, if his shot isn't falling, can take the ball to the hole for a closer shot or get the ball out to a teammate for an open shot. He's far from perfect, but I feel like he does more to improve the team when he's on the floor than Korver did.
imagine606::True, but Marco is a better offensive weapon. He breaks down defenses better rather than just coming off screens. He actually can help to create offense for other players where Korver could not do that at all.
Lewis09Gomez::and he already had clutch moments for the hawks this year
Lewis09Gomez::korver has better fg% and shot selection
Lewis09Gomez::And what facts do you have for belinelli who only played one playoff round against the aging Lakers who later got swept by the mavs. I mean he didnt do anything but shoot 30% per game. I would take Korver for late game situations. and btw, your right Korver couldnt get any shot off, thats why he only took 3 a game. Not like his gunna take 15 just to make his first shot. I take Korver. idc
Kit Ramsey::Shot selection? Ha, ha,ha,ha, He couldn't even get his shot off in the playoffs, please, i'll take Belli.
imagine606::I agree, I'll take Marco any day. He plays better defense (a taller midget), and his offense is more versatile. He's also shooting fairly close to as well as Korver did from 3 during his time with the Bulls.
ddx27::marco is a better passer and drives to the hole more than korver ever did
Lewis09Gomez::korver's too clutch, i miss that player on the team /:
ron953::I can't believe they only got 118 points I really thought they would get 130..good win Bulls
Sam58548::Byron Scott is the biggest joke of a coach in the league
CJTheChief::That title belongs to Erik Spoelstra.
ddx27::with the signing of cook and nate's contract being picked up I don't see rose coming back at all this year.
imagine606::It's still going to be the less the better, but he may have a trade involving another guard for a draft pick. Either way, he still has to pay everyone's contracts for this year, so if Rose comes back or not, he's still gotta pay up.
ddx27::yea true but we all know how cheap riensdorf is on paying the luxury tax
Kit Ramsey::If Reinsdorf is cheap, then why are the Bulls scraping the luxury tax. And going over the cap for mediocre players is not the way to go.
imagine606::That's not what those say at all. Nate's contract got picked up because his offense can be useful even if Rose is still on the team, and Cook was signed to help out with the 3 point shooting.
imagine606::Yes, that was a Vlad Rad sighting.
YogaBeer::What NBA team has you scratching your head as to why, with all their talent, do they stink?  I say T Wolves or Grizzlies.
orange_63::the browns new coach search committee?
YogaBeer::I think Portland held that title for awhile, but maybe it's b/c we all overrated their players?
imagine606::I was going to say the same thing. Maybe meant the Wizards? I can tell you what's wrong with the Wizards, veteran leadership. I thought Nene would help, but he's clearly not enough.
imagine606::It's those z teams.
YogaBeer::Good Lord yes.    How did I mix that one up.
Grape Soda Billy::how does 21-10 stink???
Derrick Roses Skittles::I'm gonna get off y'all. Sorry I wasn't chatting during the game, was too busy watching it with the fam. Goodnight and GO BULLS!
YogaBeer::I do the same thing Derrick.   HAve a good night and TTYL.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Cya dude!
ddx27::the heat are in major trouble. I don't know if they can repeat with wade's age catching up. The only way I see them making it back is with the help of stern and his refs.
Kit Ramsey::It's hard to repeat, especially when u are a jump shooting team that plays passing lanes to get their points. The good teams have figured it out. Be Patient on offense and work inside out and u will have a good chance of winning.
Bloodarrow42::too bad stern is retiring soon too lol
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Yup and Bosh sucks this year to
YogaBeer::yupp, but he did have a good run in last year's PO.
Igloo1993::CARLOOOOOOOS BOOOOOOZZZEEEERRR!
ScalabrineSwag::hey i gotta get going. i will see you guys on Wed.  -CTM and DROSE skittles go on conversations about the articles concerning the bears head coach...that is where i will be tomorrow FYI
Derrick Roses Skittles::k. see ya bud
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Ight bro Peace!! GO BULLS
botownCs::Ive been following a betting system called sportsbettingstar the past few months. ive made around 2-3K a month profits using this systems bets. You will find the system on the first page of Google by searching for sports betting systems .
Kit Ramsey::Get the hell out of here.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::With Rose  2011: 62-19  2012: 30-7  NUFF SAID That's 92-26!!
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::19-13 without Rose and many were close games. Just imagine what our record would be with him?
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Maybe bro, we are pretty much close to UNBEATABLE with D. Rose
ScalabrineSwag::28-4 :)
koke001::Yo Lew new xat board
Derrick Roses Skittles::link
koke001::.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::I mean Bellinil and Rip is a good combination at the SG position. And Booz-Taj has been a TERRIFIC combination lately
Kit Ramsey::So why add Cook?
DatGuy8921::Insurance policy if either Marco or Rip get hurt.
JohnsonnnL::Cavs should clone Thibodeau then hire the clone as their head coach.
YogaBeer::I'm fine with Scott for now.    He's improving Kyrie, Waiters and TT.    Also, he may be resurecting the career of Livingston.  I think if phil Jackson were the Cavs coach, they'd still suck at this point.
DatGuy8921::No, Phil would bring Cleveland the NBA title, NFL title, the World Cup Title and a title in Greco-Roman wrestling.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::I just think Miami has been exposed. D Wade is a shell of himself, Ray is old, Bosh is turning into a non factor, and LBJ likes to pass the ball in Clutch times. Not to mention their D has dropped off by a lot!! Idk just like the Bulls chances alot now
ScalabrineSwag::bulls have proven they can score on the heats trap the ball defense.
koke001::Lewwwwww!!!
Derrick Roses Skittles::he's cool though. What up Koke?
ScalabrineSwag::you a heat fan
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Scalabrine what was your 1-10 scale before the season? I was at a 2
ScalabrineSwag::much less bc i didnt realize noah would step up and boozer and i thought we made a huge mistake trading away our bench mob
