G man::The Lakers are constantly talking about trading Pau Gasol.  If the Thunder got him and played him at center I think that they could realistically be considered to be the best team in the league.  They desperately need a high quality center.
SpecialXFeature::Orlando really needs to move Big-Baby and Afflalo. Harris needs to be in the starting lineup as does Harkless. Think Denver would be a nice landing spot for them. Not sure what they have for expiering contracts though.
Isaac M::Even with the loss, what a difference Vucevic makes. Orlando is so, so lucky to have him.
fup duck::Once fully healthy, who will Tobias Harris replace, Afflalo or Davis?  I would think Afflalo is playing too well to be benched...in fact he's an allstar candidate.
rene::Thunder have too many weapons if they dont get you with one theyll get you with the other!
fup duck::Lamb and Jackson won this game
fup duck::Ibaka looks lost in many games, not good.
edward::If the Magic make their free throws they win the game.
jason::The Magic have way too many forwards that can play decent ball
Steven McCormick::A team that's 8-13 get's this close to a victory over OkC?!?!   Westbrook must be getting tired.
