Eric::As many high draft picks including 2 first overall, this team and organization deserves to be called trash.
Sonja Red::CAVS aren't going to make the Playoffs with that blithering idiot of a head coach.
Pugz::Now  Deng knows where he really is.
Chris::Are the Cavs on the take and some of them sports betting?  Cant believe they can be so good one night and so unbelievably bad another night for no rhyme or reason.
John::Let's look at the stats at SAC.  With few exceptions Thomas get's scored on at will by whomever he defends.  McLemore and Thornton have been worthless producers this year.  They looked okay this game, but the statistics show a lack of enthusiasm on defense especially.
Be+::When I look at the Cavs roster, I see alot of players I think are individually talented...Irving, Clark, Jack, Deng, etc.  I just can't believe with all that talent, the Kings can blow them out by 44 points.  That's just ridiculous.  Maybe the Cavs need some motivation and proper direction.
Hanz Gobeler::HOW DO YOU CONSTANTLY LOOSE BY 30 TO 40 POINTS.
No::It makes no difference who Cavs acquire, they still aren't gonna win with that putz, mike brown! He is an f'en loser!!!
GM::kyrie irving is NOT a 1st round guy, not even close when factoring ALL aspects. oh and he's always hurt w/ such a low tolerance to pain, no thanks
Bob::Sacramento wins this by 20. They are playing against the Cavs. Cavs sucks!  They are still having a losing season despite getting Irving, Deng, and useless bennet. Fact:The 2010–11 Cleveland Cavaliers have the longest losing streak in NBA history with 26 losses. (Cavs wont never be the same again after LBJ left)
