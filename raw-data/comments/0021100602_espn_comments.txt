Springfresh3::Dallas got murdered
ZonaWildcats_2170::Go Warrios(: Nice win!
balltillifall_88::im not a warriors fan, especially after their chippy-ness towards my grizzlies the other night (f u c k you nate robinson), but i hate this for steph curry. he seems to be a mature kid who is really down to earth and not an egomaniac, and he has the potential to be an ELITE guard in the nba (if he isnt already). hate to see somebody have nagging injuries like this.
WarriorsWarrior::on behalf of warriors fans thanks...  You guys half a good team... Beat us good last time!
LSD_hookem::Nobody is denying that Mavs got the last championship trophy- we are just saying it truly WAS your LAST trophy
Bexindy55::The city of Dallas is only good for its airport...and the star attraction is the JFK Assassination Museum.  Yay for Dallas.
LSD_hookem::As a former Dallasite may I say that I don't miss either one of them!
cwn425::As a Spurs fan, I read all this Mav hate and smile. It's so nice to know that the rest of the world now sees how annoying their fanbase is (except for a select few). 1 and done. The Mavs are back where they belong. Oh and Thunder fans don't listen to that "little brother" business. The Mavs are our red headed step child. The Thunder are legit. Looks like the next successful small market dynasty. Nothing but class.
sf_nick7667::we should just bench curry for the rest of the season.
wuwei619::Seriously.   The Warriors are not going to the playoffs.  And this season for Curry has been a series of foot and ankle sprains that get re-aggravated because there isn't enough time to heal.     I hate to bring up the business side, but maybe Monta isn't the one to trade.
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::Hey Mavs fans enjoy the lottery, lmao. Mavs can't even beat the bottom feeders if the West or East. Karma isn't she awesome.
LSD_hookem::Last year's champs = this year's chumps!
AndrusROY82::Champs!!!!
Oaktown1029::Any team dealing with the Warriors for Curry have to be hesitant or offer less - Warriors aren't selling. Which essentially means the Warriors only bargaining chip is Ellis - they won't stand pat - they can't. They have no draft pick to bargain with either. Damn, I hope they don't get hosed.
nylee64::"If I'm not playing for the Lakers anymore why should I give 100% why?"  - Lamar Odom
nylee64::R.I.P. Dallas Mavericks  The championship run was nice while it lasted huh??
Recornmended by ESPN::http://rnsnbc.com/headlines/latest_news/limousine
2kobeisgood4::if Odom was playing with Kobe he would be sixth man of the year
LSD_hookem::Gee Mavs fans- thunder are not mad about making more wins and more playoff appearance and wins than ANYBODY in the world predicted before losing to you last year-- we just don't like you calling us "little brother".  Adios-loser brothe!
ImOldschool1964::Nice to see manifest what I already knew--the Mavs are a huge joke, one and done.  Last year was a fluke, just as I suspected.
LSD_hookem::At least cubby can afford geritol and depends for his little. And of losers!
ImOldschool1964::testing
earlealston::Once again Megamind (Jason Terry) proving he's just a (very) poor-man's Kobe Bryant. Which is saying something 'cause Kobe is just a poor-man's MJ.....And I don't care too much for Lebron either.
NBA_refs_are_weak::it didnt look that bad for steph, and im sure he'll be good to go for the lakers, but I have a feeling its going to be one of those things where he wont be 100% for the rest of the season. ankle injuries are such a $@%!$ and it really takes a couple months of no play for it to get completely healed and not prone to reinjury. its not THAT big a deal, unless they somehow make a run for the 8th spot but I doubt it. Itll just suck for him
mrFEEZY::Lamar Odom, PF	19	1-6	1-2	0-0	1	3	4	2	0	1	0	2	-21	3  can't shake this dude. cancer has spread on the team. who knows, maybe cubes wants him out there to really tank the season, get a lottery pick to go with haywood and odom for howard. at least i hope so
mrFEEZY::as bad as they are, its better than nothing.
Jason_ninenine::Haywood and Odom for Howard? Too funny
Darrensplace::champions will always b hated. unlike the supersonics thats always on our page, they will never taste it.
LSD_hookem::Dray lol! Oh well- same thing. My dray probably is smarter than their daddy!
LSD_hookem::Right- these same Mavs fans said the other day that winning in the regular season didn't matter -only the playoffs. Didn't sound like this year meant nothing to them then! I sounds so much like--- "my dray is smarter than your daddy Nya Nya Nya""  Babies!
mrFEEZY::miami had a after championship season similar season.  really this season is a bust. winning a title in strike shorted season really doesnt mean much, so really whats the point? NBA season gets back to normal next year.
mrFEEZY::it wouldnt matter if we won, you guys would be saying the same thing.
VanGundyGoneHipster::Translation- My team is not going to win this year so it must mean this year is meaningless.
TheWalrusnow::wait so winning a title this yr doesnt mean anything? the same teams are still out there repeating, the trophy means the same thing, the playoffs have the exacts same structure. stating that this season doesnt mean anything bc it was shortened is a joke.
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::Bird he just another Mavs fans in denial that his team is a joke. The teams do this best trash talking, my Thunder are 32-9 ( league best), Mavs 23-20 trash. Enough proof in that right there. They have the title of having the worst season ever after a title win. No matter what Mavs fans say, at days end Mavs are still a joke and getting worse everyday.
AndrusROY82::Champs!!!!
Birdmann._.::they won in 1979.......... just sayin
Darrensplace::lets get through this mavs. this nig.ga thunder owns a P.H.D. in Haters. what ever it is, fight it. lets get back on top. lets get another ring, MFFL
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::Lmao, no chance at all. Mavs are just a one hit wonder. Thunder will get 2 titles before the Mavs will, so cry all you want but that's just the way it is.
AndrusROY82::Champs!!!!
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::LMAO!! like I have been saying , Mavs are a joke. Last season just proof even a blind squirrel can fins a nut. Hey J.Kidd yea no one looks at y'all as champions because champions win games.  Mavs are now the 8th seed hope they don't fall all the way out, it would be poetic. To watch the The Thunder bounce them out first round, their way to their title. But they just keel falling back, went from 4th to 8th in less then a week. Lmao, enjoy last season Mavs fans (one hit wonders) that's all y'all will have for decades.
AndrusROY82::Champs!!!!
mrFEEZY::we beat you last season with a bunch of castoffs and old superstars and a euro white guy.i would be mad too....
MaerkWoodly::Mark Cuban's pipe dream of letting key players from a title team go in order to go after D-Will and D12 just isn't going to yield results. He probably won't land one of those guys, much less both. He let a potential repeat go for what? A team that's going to struggle for years just to make the playoffs?
