ADLA4LIFE::last nights game just reiterates what the Nets organization has to do.FIRE CARLEISIMO ASAP....Deron needs to get healthy and in shape!!!...keep Lopez, Wallace, JJ, Marshon, CJ, Mirza, &amp; get some playing time for the rook, Tyshawn, resign Blatche, and get rid of Hump and Evans, bring in a PF who is athletic, can move without the ball and make a damn layup!!! Bogans [he has helped in games, but how the fck do they still put this guy in over giving Marshon major minutes, his D is OVERRATED!] , Josh Smith would've been a monster on this team!! damn i'd like for them too look to get tyrus thomas!!
oblique15::Nets have a few of the most overrated players!!! It`s why they keep coming short of where people think they should be.
brattwurst n mustard::wow - what a barnburner
vandeman34::Some moron before the game said to box out Mark and Zach and you win. Off reb: 7-17
Ivanov21::Gerald Wallace has become a shadow of himself ! What's he being paid again?
Banned Daily::memphisgroove Before the trade, we were playing .500 ball. We lost 3 games in a row by 20+ with Rudy during that span. You really don't have a clue do you? _______ The Grizzlies lost to the Spurs, Clippers and Thunder by 20.  They would still lose to those teams by 20.  Like I said let me know when they beat some good teams
memphisgroove::I'm not understanding your logic. The argument was that the raptors "won" the trade. I said that with Rudy, we were playing poorly and had gotten blown out three games in a row. We are 8 and 2 and on a 7 game winning streak since trading Rudy and last I checked, we beat Toronto in Toronto and just beat the 3rd best team in the east on their home court. We have not faced the spurs, clippers or thunder since the trade so your speculation means absolutely nothing. I have been watching the Grizz since 2000 so I know what I'm talking about. Rudy played limited defense, would take plays off and post up on the perimeter waiting for his shot so there was no ball movement. Just ask Toronto fans how they feel after Rudy completely fell apart vs the Grizz. Read the articles. He's not worth a max contract and we are better without him.
dwight thinks hes funny but all his jokes bomb like his FTs::god brooklyn nets offense is just awful
Banned Daily::jrblunkall It really pissed me off that long haired pony tail $@%!$@ announcer who was so blatantly biased to NY it made me sick.    All of them really though.... they want the big market teams to win and they live in NY or LA. Their big city teams can do no wrong.     I hate watching Memphis games when they're on the national schedule because the ESPN, TNT, NBAnetwork announcers suck.     Pete Pranica FTW. ______ Are you kidding me? listening to play by play announcers for their own teams is way worse than the ESPN, and TNT ones.  The ones talking about their teams are beyond biased.
AKsparky907::Of course home team announcers are biased. His point was that espn and tnt aren't supposed to be biased but still are.
Banned Daily::Rudy Gay&gt; Memphis
memphisgroove::Hey genius, we are 8-2 since the trade and guess who we beat in Toronto?
Banned Daily::yep and who is the best team they beat? the Warriors? Let me know when they beat a good team, like Toronto has
AKsparky907::Rudy shoots under 40%. That's really all that needs to be said.
Banned Daily::The Raptors are 7-3 since the trade and they have beat good teams.  He's SHOOTING under 40% from the field since going to Toronto (not that it matters when you look at their record since the trade) but he is a career 45% shooter from the field.  Don't make it sound he shoots under 40% every year
dwighthowardsamazing::Toronto is playing well and so is Memphis which means I was right the Rudy gay trade was good for both teams
memphisgroove::Before the trade, we were playing .500 ball. We lost 3 games in a row by 20+ with Rudy during that span. You really don't have a clue do you?
AKsparky907::Toronto is a better team now that they have Rudy. Memphis is a better team without him. Had you seen the memphis Toronto game this week you would understand why. You obviously didn't. All of us grizz fans wanted Rudy to be a superstar and he was paid as such because everyone thought he would be. Instead he just became a high volume low percentage shooter who took shots away from our high percentage shooters. How is this so hard for everyone to understand?
AKsparky907::I never said memphis is a better team without Rudy because they beat Toronto. I said if you would have seen the memphis/ toronto game you would have seen why the grizz are better without him. Two different things. The game was tied with a couple minutes left and the raps had a shooter that was on fire. Rudy went iso four possessions in a row resulting in 0 points and 4 turnovers. Grizz win.
Banned Daily::The fact that Memphis beat Toronto doesn't mean they got better without him.  When they actually beat some good teams I might believe it.
Taco with a Q::Not a fan of either team, but I got so much sh.it saying that this was a fair trade, well looks like I do know what IM talking about lol
Nash_Memph_ville::Memphis beat TORONTO.....
Banned Daily::Memphis really hasn't beat anyone that good since the trade.  The Nets are decent, but Joe Johnson was out.  Toronto has beat the Clippers, the Pacers, the Nuggets, and the Knicks twice.  This was a better trade for Toronto.
roberto fernandez55::NBA refs continue to disappoint.  They control too much of the  games outcomes.  I think Im watching WWE as an apointer tells the refs when to call fouls and when to have non calls.  inconsistency is there motto as you see a mugging on one end of the court and a pitty pat foul on  the other end and this is not the only game this happens.  Then the league makes it worst by apologizing the next day.
OmniVersal::Yu Mo Gui Gwai Fie Di Jow!
jrblunkall::It really pissed me off that long haired pony tail $@%!$@ announcer who was so blatantly biased to NY it made me sick.

Grindhouse2413::1,000 likes
Grindhouse2413::Suck on it Reggie Evans!!!!
C92400::Grizzlies have to step up and play better. If Joe Johnson was out there we would have lost. But it's nice to sweep Reggie Evans after last year's playoff disappointment.
AKsparky907::I never understand people not being satisfied with beating a good team on the road. Sure it wasn't pretty but we won. And this stuff about all the calls going our way.... I saw one call that went our way.
Latinofire20::keep thinking that. With Joe, it would've been a different defensive gameplan. therefore, it would have been a completely different game.
Banned Daily::JJ woulda hit a game winner
CJ_PATRIOT_FAN::I actually agree with the first guy, we barely beat this Nets team, and that was with almost every call going our way. Add in JJ, and we may have been blown out
NetsMagazine8::I CANT TAKE THIS LOSING $@%!...GOT DAMN
NetsMagazine8::LOL PRETTY FUNNY
OmniVersal::As a Nets and Clippers fan you should realize that winning is rare in your franchises' histories
Quickdeath2::Thanks for refs making a good no call, Williams jumped into Zach and Allen knocked the ball away.
jayblacksc::How did D-Will end up on the floor?  What a bunch of homers
emthomasjr::There were a lot worse no-calls that went against the Grizzlies (when Daye got simply knocked down driving to the rim and when Randolph was pushed under the basket on the jumpshot and it nearly went of the side of the backboard).  I agree with the no call.
Alabamian666::Nets are headed for a .500 record.
ATL_____UptonUptonAndHeyward_____ATL::Hawks w/o Joe Johnson 1/2 game back of the Nets. What a HUGE JOKE Joe Johnson is.
NetsMagazine8::REGARDLESS HOW YOU LOOK AT IT ATLANTA STILL BEHIND US...CATCH UP!!!! #BLACKANDWHITESKIES
Fat.Guy.In.A.Little.Coat::Don't tell Brooklyn that, they think he's a superstar LOL
ADLA4LIFE::No JJ, means no DWill ... as much as Deron is becoming overrated this year, the Nets would be in total disarray without him or JJ ... either way its good to have a owner who gives a fck and spends $$$$ .... either way, Nets are a athletic PF who can rebound &amp; help Brook away from becoming elite [Josh Smith please]
grizz0957::GRIZZ WIN ...
samace23::Is it me or did the nets get worse after they fired avery johnson...
ATL_____UptonUptonAndHeyward_____ATL::dude....they won like 7 in a row right after they fired him
ADLA4LIFE::Lil man Johnson 14-14 PJ ill get choked Carleisimo 19-10  do you need to know whose fairing better after 28/29 games, for now?
Alabamian666::ATL_____UptonUptonAndHeyward_____ATL - dude....they won like 7 in a row right after they fired him  ....and then what happened?
milw-jay::This must have been fun to watch.
JBRITT111::Grizz can win ANY series... with any team...PERIOD!
The G_d Delusion::They are the Pacers of the Western Conference.
JBRITT111::With better, smarter players and a better coach!
slapshotcity123::I'm off. See you guys in the Grizz/Mavs board
icepik1234::later
Ontario925::I'm watching the Oscar's now and the director award winner's hair looks like Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper in the movie Easy Rider 1969,Lol
Ontario925::Lol
slapshotcity123::"I'm watching the Oscar's now"   I stopped reading here
GangstaNets::Yo Ima be back on here later. Tryna pick up this white girl cashier at the supermarket. Once I get myself some of dat Ima be back in this crib to talk some basketball
Ina_Knick_of_Time::This guy is a bigger loser the the BrooklynNets
roy2daboy::I hope you use protection because we don't need another idiot born into this world.
emthomasjr::LMAO!
slapshotcity123::hahaha
slapshotcity123::Get her bruh. No means no though
Ontario925::The Nets Russian owner should take a deeper look at the Miami Heat ownership and management on how you build a top Eastern Conference and NBA contender each year. He also should take a deeper look at the Spurs ownership and management. It takes a lot more than just a lot of money to be a top competing team in every sport every year over the course of a 12 year period which the Spurs have done most years in that period. Only the Lakers have been more successful since 2000.
Ontario925::It worked north with the Bulls in the 1990's and it can work with other teams further north.
Latinofire20::Um....the Bulls drafts players who turned into great hall of famers. and Rodman was all about rebounding.
MykelMykel::Take a look at Miami ? not everybody can convince 3 of the top 10 players to come play for them.
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::Hey man... John Hollinger has these Grizz rollin' eh?
emthomasjr::I don't know, but I saw him at the game the other night I just get past repeatedly thinking that will all the money he makes, he surely can do something better with that hair shadow.
slapshotcity123::Undecided. I feel like eventually he being so loyal to his PER ratings are going to screw him
slapshotcity123::That's why Tay fits in so perfectly. He doesn't need to have the ball in his hands all the time to be efficient, like Rudy did. Works better so we can get Z-bo and Marc more touches.
slapshotcity123::Gay wasn't a good fit, chemistry wise. Most Grizz fans knew this but fans of other team didn't and still don't
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::Well after that Gay trade I thought everything would fall apart.  Yet they're on some sort of winning streak.
Ontario925::The Nets are three more good young shooting and position players away from being able to compete with Western Conference teams as good as they do against Eastern Conference teams.
Mets2410::PJ says that he fears Brook is losing confidence because he has barely played him in the 4th the past 3 games. $@%! you PJ you're going to ruin our only all-star.
cjbrown4587::I don't have to be...the Nets are funny enough
cjbrown4587::the only thing ruining his confidence is the fact that his name is Brooke.
Mets2410::if you're gonna troll at least be funny
OmniVersal::The only gangsta on the Nets is Mirza Teletovic
slapshotcity123::"I'm 6'8 300 lbs, got 6 girls, 8 cars, and I've killed 20 men"  -GangstaNets
slapshotcity123::"I'm 6'8 300, got 6 b*tches, 8 cars, and killed 10 men"  -GangstaNets
GangstaNets::Nets just need to get on dat real sh**. F*** all da haters and f*** REFS. It's about will of the man not skill of the man and we gon go all the way if we put this sh** behind us and ball out. F*** LeBron, send the goons on that n***a ya dig? Like what the Wizards did to him back in the day.
Ina_Knick_of_Time::Lmao haha the worst.   "We gon win a title all we have to do is send da goons on every teams top players and we got this"  -Wankstanets
cjbrown4587::you're probably white and live in Wyoming...why are you talking like this?
dave19741997::The wanna-be is trying to act hard.
slapshotcity123::ya bruh
dave19741997::Pirates win, JJ wins the Daytona 500, the Grizz win... Very good day
Ontario925::I only just watch the Daytona 500 every year. I used to watch more of the season races up until the Intimidator died in 2001. He was the only reason left I followed all the season races after Petty retired in 1992
icepik1234::people still watch nascar? I thought that was for women now?
OmniVersal::Goes to show what an awesome coach Jerry Sloan was.
TRSling::Goes to show what great players he had. Do you think it is a coincidence that no one else has hired him?
Nargash35::Not really..!! ---Deron..!!
OmniVersal::Lol and that attitude is why his cankles are crumbling
Nargash35::Teletovic = Novak but way better defender and rebounder..!!
cjbrown4587::novak doesn't airball 3 straight times...
thekola::sorry, but Novak lead the league in 3pt% one year. MT3 at 32% right now.
Nargash35::Novak can't do anything but shoot 3's. Mirza can shoot 2's defend grab rebounds..!!
Ontario925::The old ABA teams were even better than the NBA Eastern Conference teams today.
Ontario925::No but the person must be a big fan of the name Ontario because they create their profile with the name over 2 years after mine.
Nargash35::Are you Bill Ontario?
Miami Heat are beast::Biggie Biggie Biggie cant you see some times your words just hypnotize me and i just love your flashy ways guess thats why they broke and your so paid     R.I.P Biggie Smalls
junoNCAL::how the fk do the griz keep winning without Gay?  stupid nets, you were supposed to win!
LEGOD JAMES OWNS CARSMELLO ANFERNEE::<b>DEFAT WILLIAMS IS A FAT FAKE SUPERSTAR WHO CHOKES.</b>
GangstaNets::That n***a Wallace is garbage as sh**. I swear if I ever see him in Bed-Stuy, Ima beat that @ss. I'm only 5'8, 150 but I garantee I ball harder than that wack @ss southern b8tch.
roy2daboy::Never answered my question.  Thought so.
cjbrown4587::Uh oh, clear out guys.....E-thug on the loose
roy2daboy::What's your beef with the South small fry???
roy2daboy::If I replied to your post, then I'm obviously talking to you kiddo!!!!!
GangstaNets::Small fry? Who u think u talkin to, yo? You tryna bring it to me?
slapshotcity123::lmfao new name already?
cjbrown4587::you need to relax
GangstaNets::nah f*** that sh** my Nets got ROBBED
roy2daboy::Hmmm.  Should I watch the Oscars or OKC/Chicago???
Grindhouse2413::Go take care of the wife, thats what I am about to do as soon as I lay my kid down
emthomasjr::So, now all we need is for Cuban to say that the Grizzlies should consider amnestying ZBo in the offseason, and he can go for 40 vs. the Mavs Wednesday!  LOL.
junoNCAL::how the fk do the griz keep winning?  stupid nets, you were supposed to win
Mets2410::Nets go 5-13 from the stripe, lose by 4.
GangstaNets::Yeah ight
cjbrown4587::Deron goes 5 pizza slices - 13 buffalo wings from the postgame buffet, gains 4.
Mets2410::good one?
GangstaNets::I'm only 5'8, 150 but I garantee I ball harder then that B**CH @SS Brooks. I hate wen n***as be f***in up. My n***a DWill came to play but Brooks and Wallace ain't sh**. I want to beat both they @sses. Word is bond if I see them on my streets in Bed-Stuy Ima light them up. Especially Wallace. Scrub @ss suthern mutha***a
Ontario925::All 8 seeded Western Conference teams in Postseason qualifying range are better than the Nets. The Knicks would even be fighting for 8th seed in the Western Conference. That tells you how much of a pushover powderpuff joke the NBA Eastern Conference is when you minus the Heat. The real NBA level is in the Western Conference!
Grindhouse2413::No argument there!
emthomasjr::It's funny coming on fan boards like these and listening to fans bemoan their team after getting ground up by the Grit and Grind.  It was only one game!!  I'll take the win for my team, but the Nets only face the Grizzlies twice this year.  Y'all are still 4th in the Eastern Conference.  Joe Johnson was out too.  I think your team in going to be OK.  Toronto fans were ripping Rudy when the Grizzlies beat them, then he turned around and put up 32 in a win over the Knicks.
djny2k12::Turnovers has doomed this nets team....and it continues to bite them.
TheJTram::This was quite a good game to watch and I still get to see Prince play despite being in another jersey -sheds tears- But, at least Prince is with a team where he's needed so I'm happy for the dude.
icepik1234::He fits our team perfectly. Couldnt ask for more from him. Daye and Davis were the cherry on top with that trade.
slapshotcity123::It must be nice seeing him play in meaningful games  for a change of the past few seasons
emthomasjr::He is critical. He is the Grizzlies Battier 2.0.
