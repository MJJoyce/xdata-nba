bustasports::full nba 2011 re-draft  kenneth faried 2nd pick, enes kanter 17th  this was actually a good draft, but the draft order wasn't right  http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/2012/03/full-20...
clippsallday::where amazing happens...
nbafanatic69::orlando is going to own this team so bad come weds...
pokamah::U have the SAME personality as GRANGER from PACERS..................do you want to lose FACE too?
nbafanatic69::Maybe put in bibby or DWTDD .  bd won't do it, and neither will lin.
pokamah::NEW YORK is a TO's team regardless of the PG's!!!!
nbafanatic69::Still, maybe lin should sit out more games.
pokamah::NBA need JLIN to attract $$$$$$................if JLIN sits, so does $$$$$ goes down, do you want that!!...............got to admit, knicks vs bucks was SUPER BORING w/o JLIN................rather see JLIN TO's + pass the ball , than BARON TO's + ball hogger!
nbafanatic69::Wow, Jennings and Ellis could not have been worse in this game.  Pathetic.
cellus24::jeremy lin after the game talking about not playing last night and when he'll be back in action http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzdAINOuH5k&amp;feature=channel
NYFranc::is it me or landry fields don't deserve to be on starting lineup lately?
Jamaal 43::Carmelo can play like his old self these next few games with Amare out but he doesn't need to score like he did in Denver, just play around ball when Lin and hopefully Amare gets back. There is nothing wrong with Melo getting 15, 7 and 5 when the team is winning and playing together.
Tagirl29::Melo's still a star. He just needs to adjust. He wasn't able to adjust under D'Antoni and is now adjusting. He'll get back to his old ways as one of the top scorers in the game.
pokamah::highly doubt MELO will ever recover................unless he's out of new york, which we would like that to happen.
Jamaal 43::Carmelo has been adjusting all year.
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::If you compare Melo with ordinary NBA players, his performance is good. If you compare him with star players like Lebron, Melo's performance is not impressive at all....
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::A "star" SF/SG should maintain his FG% at least above .450...
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::Nobody could ever ignore Melo's low FG%: .399 for the entire season and .377 for the past five games!
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::Melo is a good player, no doubt about it. But no star anymore... His FG% was never able to climb up.
TK729::Monta Ellis: 2/14 (4 points) &gt; He won the game for the Knicks along with a subpar peformance from Jennings.
Jamaal 43::Amare's back is a long term issue :((
ny201204::call Tebot.
KevinBryant1987::Let's hope he miraculously wakes up with a healthy back.
MeeGale757::Keep it going Melo.
pokamah::MELO is due for a check up, his engine needs tuning!
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::Melo's performance last night was very far away from "superb". Bucks messed up the game themselves. With low FG%, Knicks just took high risk... Melo should greatly improve his precision. Otherwise, Knicks are not going anywhere further...
KevinBryant1987::Well, knowing Melo, asking him to play like that for the next few games is considered a wish, let alone the rest of the season. I agree with the other guys stepping up. We just need that strong all around teamwork that helped us blow some teams by 20-30 points in the recent past.
Geech63::forget the next few games it needs to be the rest of the regular season and the playoffs..especially with Amare out..and other guys need to step up...they were taking too many 3's..
KevinBryant1987::Let's hope we see that again during the next few games. We're definitely going to need it on top of everyone else on the team contributing like they're fighting for a world-wide cause.
Geech63::before that Memphis game he had these numbers but was shooting a better percentage
KevinBryant1987::He's got to play better. Those 28 points were barely on the market. He had all year to play like this consistently. But I'm also not a pro-baller, so I can't hate on Melo but I just hope he throws these numbers down without all the misses during the next few very important games.
Hawaiian_OU_Fan::Baron Davis just made Jeremy Lin a loooooot of money with his shabby performance! Knicks managements knows now they better keep Lin 'cause Baron canNOT be a starter with his play.
pokamah::BARON REALLY SUCKS
RedWoodClassic::Well, if Baron was due 15Mil this year and another 15Mil+ next. I don't think he cares much.
KevinBryant1987::I wouldn't blame Baron if that was the case, either.
Kobe Messi::<strong>http://hoopsgrind.com/2012/03/25/lebron-james-vs-kevin-durant/ </strong> Lebron vs. Durant - who's better and why.
KevinBryant1987::I think people should pass a standard IQ test before begin able to register for a username here on ESPN. That or enter a legitimate social security number with a picture of their face so there is less trolling around going on. Sick of all these lame a** people posting useless rants.
pokamah::you need to get yourself check, freedom of speech ok
KevinBryant1987::Then you can enter your national insurance number. I'm all about equality.
RedWoodClassic::What happens if I'm from England and I don't have a social security card? Am I not allow?
kalinguyen303::Thanks buddy
KevinBryant1987::I'll give you the benefit of the doubt since math isn't my forte, either.
kalinguyen303::1+1= 4?
SJYankee1::That game was so garbage. No wonder Lin made it fun to watch. Even when he's turning over the ball. Can't stand Davis and his dragged out dribbling.
KevinBryant1987::Lin is pretty good, but wait 'til he gets to Baron's age, too. Remember that Baron used to be hot fire when he was younger. It's not like Baron is out on the court f***king around. He's obviously trying his best but all these bandwagon fans don't know how to respect let alone spell it.
pokamah::u should watch the game, BARON was TO's MACHINE, worst than JLIN..................................
pokamah::baron might be special in his prime but the fame was nothing near JLIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ofsfan::We don't know what Lin will be like at 30, but he isn't there now.  He is the better option to start now.  I didn't watch the game.  It seems that BD did what he needed to to help win.  Bottom line, that's all that matters.
RedWoodClassic::True. Baron was special in his prime.
Hawaiian_OU_Fan::Lin turns it over on average per minute LESS than BD, and quite often doesn't even lead his team in TOs for a game.
kalinguyen303::Jeremy Lin is the best PG...Buahhaha
ofsfan::kalinguyen303 - Jeremy Lin is the best PG...Buahhaha  ....playing for the Knicks.
KevinBryant1987::Don't push it. He's good and still progressing, but he's not the best. This is how Linsanity got started (because people were over-hyping his performance) and also how a lot of unnecessary pressure was put on Lin without his consent.
Nique_Olajuwon_Ewing::Baron Davis is hot garbage.

Losmonsta::glad i didnt have to WATCH this. Melo gets to line +1. WTF is Smith doing hoisting up 10 3's??? At least half those should be shot by NOvak. I guy who actually MAKES some. JR, go to the hole. You're shooting 11.5 % from three over last 5. Sheessh.

JLobello4::you must be 5 or 6 years old to even think about that joke... grow up
jimjc77::UH OHHHH, Somebody forgot to take their Meds todayyyyyyyyy
KevinBryant1987::Jlobella go stick to salsa. This ain't a discussion board for you to rant your mindless talk.
JLobello4::ya hes so overated... stupid asian
Hawaiian_OU_Fan::Look at Lin's stats compared to the rest of the PGs in the league... he's in the top... PLUS, he drastically effects the games in a major positive way, especially with his play in the 4th.  Go troll somewhere else!
RedWoodClassic::"I'm allergic to punctuation marks"  - JLobello4
RedWoodClassic::This coming from you... wow.

JLobello4::stop hating
JLobello4::i guess since i go to harvard
jimjc77::LOL.
RedWoodClassic::You are just mad that you are not even smart enough to get into Lin's school to be the janitor.
RedWoodClassic::People in glass house... LOL
jimjc77::I'm not the one picking on Howard because he is black and Lin because he is Asian.   You are the one to bring it up.  You could have picked on Howard on his skills but you brought up his skin color and your brought up Lin's ethnicity.  You could have picked on his skills too but you had to bring skin into it.  Stop the hate man.  You need to get out of your country house and get into the city to see other people or something....
JLobello4::im not racist at all im not a bucks fan just speaking the truth and lin isnt good regardless of his skin color you $@%! read the newspaper and open a damn door for once
jimjc77::First you call Howard a big wet soggy (*)&amp;^ now your picking on Lin because he is Asian.  Stop being so racist.  Ignorant Bucks fans
DPetro10::Lin $@%!$@% sucks. Its Vinsanity.. that little $@%!$@ took his name
RedWoodClassic::I highly doubt Lin had anything to do with the word Linsanity. Stop being a P rick and hate on him
DPetro10::Hi my name is jimjc77 and I like to say you mad bro because I am super cool.

jimjc77::Try English clown.  Stop playing with your cats and dogs.  Do something with your life and please pick a real team over the Bucks.  Just makes you look stupid.

DPetro10::yea shut him up

DPetro10::they blow
alexracine1983::NY 35 free throws MIL 18 free throw attemts
DPetro10::$@%! U
thee_duckweed@yahoo.com::MSG is a joke. Let's allow defenders to grab the ball holders face.
Tiger7Yankees::1 I think its time for Melo-sanity 2 HUGE win by the Knicks 3 Knicks will miss Amare 4 Lin can be replaced, not Amare 5 Melo proved he's a superstar, and he also proved  that he can actually be the  leader of  a team, he just proved all that last night
Hawaiian_OU_Fan::Did you see BD's replacement of LIN??? No, Lin right now is not replaceable with anyone on the current Knicks bench!
KevinBryant1987::Melo had his chance for a "melo-sanity" all year. He f***ked himself over.
KevinBryant1987::You keep thinking that.
junyangche::melo stinks
mspearlmay::Watching a real point guard play for the Knicks last night must surely have reminded NY fans what a real point guard is after watching mediocre Lin for so many of his weak games.
Hawaiian_OU_Fan::Are you being sarcastic? You must be as Baron was TERRIBLE!!!
Umfa King Kupton::mspearlmay wins biggest dumbf.uck of the year
RedWoodClassic::Hahaha... yeah 9 TOs, 3 for 12 shooting. You are an idiot. Stop hating on Lin.  Knicks didn't win that game. Just because the Bucks had a worse game.
shyongkwon::You know Baron's hurting this morning.  Probably calling in sick today for today's practice. heh
DavieDeeFTW::The shooting by the Bucks starting guards was putrid. Why isn't Skiles ever mentioned as a coach who's on the hot seat?
brewersfan712::Its moments like this when you pop in leuer who is a great shooter and puts up alot of points when he gets minutes
shyongkwon::Maybe a prior six game winning streak might have something to do with it.
DavieDeeFTW::A lot of teams go on short winning streaks. That isn't remarkable.  When the Bucks falter down the stretch, as Skiles' teams always do, because of his idiotic decisions, then we'll see if he finally starts getting some hot seat consideration. Lucky for him he's in Milwaukee, where pretty much no one cares.
knicksman7654::Huge win
pyskatyskurwiel::MELO-WOOD
ivjo31::I think the most important offseason move for the knicks is to acquire the whole Phoenix Suns medical staffs....
ivjo31::Baron should start over Lin!  Lin is a turnover prone!
Umfa King Kupton::ivjo31 is co-winner of biggest dumbf.uck of the year
neosoul1500::Baron had 9 turnovers you dumb noodle
jason_bautista::nice joke.  :)  prepare for Baronsanity or Linsanity?
March Madness.::18 vs 35 ft's? ahhahahahahahah. That's why no one can take the nba seriously
marat75::A patriot shot Lin in the knee for Pearl Harbor.
March Madness.::Knicks win a worthless game and ESPN is all over their balls
Duke was my NC pick::worthless game ? yes because there were no playoff implications here, besides why are you here if its so worthless ?
shyongkwon::Yet...you waste your own time to come on here and post?  What a $@%!$@.
bchalcyon89::Knicks management have no idea what basketball is, it's about profit for MSG. their only good pick this year was Tyson Chandler, they got lucky with Jeremy Lin, and the rest of the players are close to Harlem Globetrotters quality that bring in audience who will buy  $10 beer from MSG.
Oldjoker1111::Actually I think beer is $12
pokamah::so i just saw the game KNICKS vs BUCKS....................my thoughts........KNICKS REALLY SUCKS............only reason knicks won cause BUCKS SUCKS too!!...................BOTH TEAM, so MANY TO's...............i lost track..........but TO's that stands out R BARON DAVIS.........this guy is a JOKE, he's a TURNOVER MACHINE and BALL HOGGER.....every time knicks R leading, BARON just have to get a TO..............BARON SUCK SO BAD, I COULDNT STAND HIM on the court, ............when the season ends, baron davis becomes FREE AGENT,..........................PLEASE KNICKS save your team by REMOVING BARON ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!!
bagofmoney_30::LMAO STAY IN SCHOOL
shyongkwon::Apparently, he didn't stay in school.  Poster child for our failed public education system.  FTL
julzNYK::an english teacher would have a field day with that............paragraph.
Tim EliTebow::biased, unrealistic comment.
Antsea91::I was wondering how the hell did melo get 28 pts with only 8 fgm and then I saw the free throws and understood. NBA is trying their hardest to get as many big market teams into the playoffs as possible. Stern must be jizzing right now since both the clippers and knicks are playoff teams.
shyongkwon::Watch the f-in game before you make nonsensical comments.  He got fouled during a shot attempt, thus the FT attempts.  Idiot.
OptimusPrime4.0::Who thinks the NBA is rigged??? Im still on the fence not sure what to believe.... But seeing that the knicks shot 18 free throws in the 3rd qt of their game and the bucks shot 0 makes me think the league is
Lorenzomax14::Excuses easy come hardly go.
vions::Of course the Bucks could just let Anthony go to the basket unimpeded. But they decided to foul and bet that he might miss some FT. He did miss quite a few. So it is a choice. If the defender backed off, he would shoot. If the defender jammed him, he would drive to the basket. This is also a choice.
bronxbomber62::Did you watch the game?  Fouls were all on penetrations to the basket.  Bucks? No defense.
jason_bautista::Tired?  This is a compressed season afterall.
bchalcyon89::I think NBA is rigged because David Stern was not allowed to have an NBA league in China, so he went home and tweaked his home grown business. Not even sure why Jeremy Lin who went on 7 streak win would lose to NO Hornets.
MavsNation92::All four city's brackets picked a basketball player    Basketball seems to be dominating, since it's basketball season right now. (Except in Boston, because the bandwagoners are off the wagon since the Celtics suck this year)    Lin winning in NY  Kobe winning in LA  Dirk winning in Dallas  MJ winning in Chicago
bagofmoney_30::YEAHH
bagofmoney_30::LIN SANITY HAS TAKEN THE GLOBEEEEEEEEEEEE THAT BOY GOOD
Antsea91::Yeah lin is pretty much the yao ming of this decade save for the fact that lin's american. I have a feeling china will be voting lin into the ASG starters next year...
pokamah::CORRECT!!!.............JLIN is the BEST NEW YORK ever had...................cause he's not just helping NBA boost sales, but he's also HELPING the ECONOMY........................ SSSHHHHHHH!!!!!!........China is giving back some $$$$$$...............dont u know USA owe china $$$, but ALL JLIN did was play ball and China is giving back $$$$.........u know the meaning of "JLIN is OUR SAVIOR!!!!".............................can someone tell OBAMA the secret to saving our economy..................?....I"M SOLD! JLIN IS THE MAN!!
MavsNation92::I'm still LMAO how Lin won it. At least Dirk is a respectable pick
bagofmoney_30::NO LOL I SEEN THE NY POLL I THINK JETER SHOULD OF WON WITH RIVERA SECOND AND ELI 3RD
MavsNation92::So you're saying Lin is the best thing in NY ever. Even better then the yankees? I was surprised Dirk won over a Cowboy player
bagofmoney_30::THIS YOUNG BOY SHUMPERT WAS A GREAT PICK FOR THE KNICKS. SHUMP STREET
bronxbomber62::Great D
