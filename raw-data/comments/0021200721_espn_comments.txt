DWoe23::how do the pacers deserve being called the new bad boys of 2013 just because they are one of very few teams that play defense....I would rather not have our Pacers nicknamed after the dirty Pistons. I would rather their nickname be tenacious P, lol.
pacers2013::I felt that Thorpe made some good points though, especially that the Pacers under Frank Vogel hit other teams before they can hit us. I'm talking about in your face D, tough rebounding, and contesting any and all 3 point shots. That does not make us the new bad boys, but it does make the Pacers a contender.
Cubswin000::How's granger and George going to play together??     We are going to get even better  on the D..
pacers2013::At first Danny might transition back to playing time by coming off the bench, but ultimately they will slide PG to the 2 guard (he can play 1-3) and let Danny reclaim the small forward spot. Lance will have an adjustment in terms of minutes, but with veteran leaders and a great coaching staff his continued productivity should remain a key part of our growing success.
DWoe23::PG - George Hill SG - Paul George SF Danny Granger PF David West C Roy Hibbert  6th man - Lance Stephenson Role Players - T. Hans - DJ Aug. &amp; Johnson
DWoe23::George can guard Chalmers - George can guard D Wade - Granger can gaurd Lebron - West can guard Bosh - &amp; Hibbert can guard Haslem  I like our chances this year vs the Heat. This starting 5 for the Pacers are now 1.5 years together. The chemistry is growing more and more. Lance has sprouted to be a wildcard player. and our back up center wont be a walk over this year.
Carmelloisfake::And once granger is back, sam young should never see the court again!
pacers2013::Agreed. Sam played very good perimiter defense against both Wade and James in our games vs the Heat. He may get only 5-7 minutes/game, but those are key segments of games.
TryHardSlime::I love Sam Young, but he's been doing nothing, except playing decent defense.
Taco with a Q::And look lost in defense
DWoe23::he has been playing really bad, but he does show promise on the defensive end.
digjuv::Draftday  http://www.draftday.com/go/digjuv
digjuv::http://www.draftday.com/go/digjuv   challenge me
DWoe23::Pacers have 13 games left vs currently seeded playoff teams and of those games, 6 of them are on the road. (didnt count lakers because they arent in playoff contention)
digjuv::Challenge me  http://www.draftday.com/go/digjuv
austin_0520::If only the Pacers played like this every road game...
DWoe23::good news is there is only 14 road games left, lol.
Taco with a Q::Better news is only 6 are agaisnt winning teams
DWoe23::Pacers only have the nets and knicks this month as tough games. Lets  hope they take advantage of it and finish out this month with 8 more wins.
DWoe23::Pacers best case scenerio for the playoff seedings are to be in the same bracket with the knicks and let the Heat and Bulls be in there own bracket. So best case the Pacers would only face the Knicks and potentially playing the winner between the bulls and Heat. #1 seed Heat #2 seed Pacers #3 seed Knicks #4 seed Bulls.
pacers2013::I agree 100%. I don't want to see the Heat until the ECF, because by then they will have been beaten up a bit by the Bulls in the 2nd round, and they will not be looking forward to an even more physical matchup with the Pacers.
RabbiLevine::Agreed do not want us at a 4 or 5 seed and Chicago taking the other. Don't need to see them till further rounds.
DWoe23::we get to see Rudy Gay for the 3rd time this year, tomorrow
RabbiLevine::Prediction- Danny Granger makes his debut on Monday vs the Nets.
OlBoyP::ive heard he will be back next wednesday against the bobcats
OlBoyP::he will be coming off the bench for a little while.
DWoe23::I hope they take it easy on him to come back. Pacers are playing great without him, they dont need to rush it. they still have 32 regular season games to go.
chazzzzz1965::Wow. We are a very stinky team.
Theironrod2012::Mr. George &gt; Lebron
rlt45::Kwame Brown and Nick Young starting?  Times are bad in Philly.
This_Guy1::lol 69 points XD
chern05::Best D in the league!
Credil54::Started betting with a system called Sportsbettingstar now for a couple of months. I found this on the first page of google by searching for sports betting systems. Since I started I have made around $3,000 a month just following it. Ive tried a few systems in the past and nothing compares to how well this one does.
fairandbalanced00::pacer fans your teams is irrelevant, you are not even on Espn headlines.....
Momma Pete96::Clearly if you have to go out of your way to tell us this, they must be relevant enough.
This_Guy1::The Pacers are a good team. They don't need the media telling them that..
ngabrek::good. thats how we like it. dont need a "pacer index" to tell us how good we are
Copious_Fred::I love this Pacers not for what they do on the court, but for what they stand for. This Pacers squad is currently saving the Pacers fan base. 3 years ago you;d be lucky to see the stand 1/2 to 2/3 full. Now even though its not full consistently you are starting to see than come to Bankers life. Its a beautiful thing. This team reminds me of that 99-00 team.
DWoe23::i wouldnt go that far as a comparison. I would say they remind me of the 2003 team. Brad Miller, Jermaine ONeal, Reggie Miller, Ron Artest, Jamaal Tinsley, Al Harrington, Jeff Foster, Austin Croshere, Ron Mercer
