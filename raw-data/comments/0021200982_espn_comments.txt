KBells87::The Spurs real test starts right now. They play I think 12 of their last 15 games of the season against playoff teams. Been saying this for a month. Surprised I haven't heard mention of their brutal schedule coming up anywhere.
jamesgang824::you guys really showed up those cavs.  spurs wont even make the west conference champ game
I hate Jerry Jones::troll much?
Kanokkb::Cavs are relentless. Spurs will be fine.
Trace2010::Any argument that any other team makes   The Spurs are better than they were 2008-2011.  The proof:  Drew Gooden, Matt Bonner, Richard Jefferson, and Brent Barry-    Kurt Thomas (undersized) and Antonio McDyess-     Vs. Kawaii Leonard, Boris Diaw and Tiago Splitter-  More consistency from role players.    Spurs are a lot better than they used to be.
jackp16::WOW! That Tim Duncan is fannnnnnnnnnnntastic! The Spurs will win it all as they crush the Heat in the finals.
You Know I Rock::kawow long arms is going to be a threat!!!  he has longer arms and bigger hands than lebron...
texican_10::Timmy is the messiah
oldcoach1961::Hope the Cavs bring back Kevin Jones and give him sometime here at end of season. I know he can help if given a chance!!!!
FeFyeFoeRun::Heat would take out the Spurs in 5. No competition whatsoever!
Vaquero In The House::FeFye - In 5?  No competition what-so-ever?  Think again cowboy, the high octane Spurs bench almost beat the Heat &amp; all their starters (hell, I believe LeBron James was seen on the bench with an oxygen mask on).  Speaking of James, the Spurs have a young kid names Kawih Leonard who is very capable &amp; has proven he can guard the likes of James &amp; Kevin Durant.    Something to ponder:  There's a reason for Coach Popovich's madness of sending his starters home for the game against the Heat.  He's already one step ahead of the Heat coaching staff &amp; probably has already drafted a game plan in the event the two teams meet at the big dance.    So don't let stupidity over reality put a dent in your wallet cowboy, odds would favor the Spurs (that's including their starters) putting away the Heat in 5.  Chi-ching!!
You Know I Rock::lol leonard is waking up...i would love to see allen on him
DalvinSplit::Question ?  If  we play you guys in finals ,how you think you will stop T Parker penetration and T Duncan post play ???
Queue10::Heat fans think Chalmers &gt; Parker and J Anthony &gt; Duncan. They also think Battier and Ray Allen are &gt; Green and Leonard
DalvinSplit::At age 36 by far  Tim Duncan is BEST big man  player in the game  l!!  Just  awesome . But more impressive is play of K Leonard. Dear Spurs fans we have new NBA star in him . Remind me a lot on Scotte Pippen  play !! He will be  the " Man " in this coming playoffs ,and if healthy Spurs have very good chance to go all the way and win their 5th Championship  !
jackp16::Let me add that the Spurs have the best coach in the NBA.. "Pops" just keeps on truckin.
Vaquero In The House::Coach Popovichi was calling plays from the locker room.....
sscott907::Last year, his rookie year I bought his jersey after just watching him in pre-season,  I just had a feeling about him,  I wear it with pride-but I feel like I'm cheating on Timmy-LOL
DalvinSplit::You did good ,Tim will not mind. Leonard is Spurs future !!!.
oldcoach1961::Zeller is SOFT!!!! ONE REBOUND....
soulfirecracker::If I hear turn back the clock one more time in going on a shooting rampage
slam_dunk_on_u::So it looks like more and more like the spurts will be first round  exiters if they play my Lakeshow ...these clown spurts are barely getting by lottery bound teams....And what is it with Parker faking injuries and getting an extended vacation...although I'm suspecting that is not totally up to him but to the crater man.. Ultra conservative paranoi f..vc..k
soulfirecracker::I hope you choke on some curry before the playoffs even start. Then you will be dead and still life will go on.

slam_dunk_on_u::Pathetic  a$$ spurts barely beat the lowly Cavs and this team supposed to be a contender????? Lol...
slam_dunk_on_u::Pathetic  a$$ spurts barely beat the lowly Cavs and this team supposed to be a contender????? Lol...
Ohh Kay See::Tim Duncan is the greatest player in the post Jordan Era
slam_dunk_on_u::Only in your dreams dumba$$
slam_dunk_on_u::Only in your dreams dumba$$
VincetheGee::Holy $@%!, Kawhi, you're a beast.
howdythrrrrr::Pop should postpone his retirement till Kawhi leaves
slam_dunk_on_u::Nope Popazit will retire as soon as his lover Duncon does
slam_dunk_on_u::Nope Popazit will retire as soon as his lover Duncon does
bluekaze21::this is what Tim duncan is capable of when he actually gets minutes and touches. look at his per minute average, they are Still at a very high level.  he is all class too, never seen a more unselfish and no-drama player. sad day when timmy finally retires, i think 50% of the NBA's class goes with him.
Kobe-it was consensual-Bryant::Tim Duncan us a beast. Hate the spurs but I had to drop some love for Timmy. I would take him over Howard any day
MetsxlxNLxlxChampsxlx2013::Anyone want live up to date Earl Watson news hit me up on twitter @EarlWatson33    Get in the head of one of the greats because the days are winding down on his illustrious career     #ETPW46THMAN
Chrisp722_NY2::I can tell you Kawhi Leonard would not be as good as he is if he was on any other team. Coach Pop brings out the best in players. See Danny Green, Gary Neal.
thedrwolff::Check out Kawhi leanards stat line....the 21 yr old in his 80th start of his career.   24-13-4-2-2 on 9-16 shooting.     Hmmmmm he IS developing faster then Duncan/ginobilli is declining.   This kid is the real deal and he's going to be special.    can you say 20-10 with great defense and a 3 point shot??????   He will be that good.  His offense has more then just open jump shots.  He can create, drive and finish with power.  He has all the athleticism with speed and leaping and hand size at 6' 7".    Not GOAT potential but a very good player for many years....he still 21 through this year.
howdythrrrrr::his came is so complete it's scary
_clyde_drexler::We will win a championship before Lebron does  -Dan Gilbert
Daryl in San Antonio::Are Spurs allergic to playing defense? Stephen Jackson -18 and Joseph -17....yikes!
dschad118::They were playing good D earlier in the season. If they can't pull it together when parker get's back. They can forget about a championship. Them playing good D was what they had over OKC!! Lenord can not stop everyone by him self!
Dane Kitazaki::seems like it
WatergateSwag III::Walt Disney Internet group? what the hell
Ron5828::In 06 Spurs offered Parker for Kobe straight up i wonder what would have happened?
dodgerblue2224::Duncan is playing like the best big man in the league right now.
dschad118::Ya, but he has got his emotion back. Against Dallas the other night, when he kept getting hackd on every shot. He slamed the ball down and got an AND 1. Did anyone see his face after that play!!! Thats the Timmy that was winning titles.
thedrwolff::because he is....the best big in the league.  People just forget that.   17-10-2.7 blocks a game on 30.2 min a night with 80% FT shooting.    he does it on both ends better then anyone else all season long
I hate Jerry Jones::Amen
mastur baiter::even our house maid says that this duncan is a god. And she doesn't really follow basketball...
Strike 1 yer OUT::f your maid you $@%!$@
WatergateFAG::hey guys im a $@%
mastur baiter::even our house maid says that this duncan is a god. And she doesn't really follow basketball...
realNBA_analyst v2.0::a little under 300 comments away from 2k. if this was a Heat thread, no matter what team they played, this thread would be at 5k within the hour.  Man, the Spurs are boring.
You Know I Rock::^^^needs to see if kobe is okay and kiss paul injury like every other game...
slam_dunk_on_u::realNBA_analyst v2.0 - a little under 300 comments away from 2k. if this was a Heat thread, no matter what team they played, this thread would be at 5k within the hour.  Man, the Spurs are boring.  ---------------------  Hahahaha. Very true!!!

dschad118::If you knew anything about basketball and were an analyst, you would know that the spurs are the funniest team to watch. They play pure basketball. Teams like heat, clips and others are flashy, but they suck and don't know how to play as a team and that will hurt them. and you must be scared because without Parker, Duncan, Giniobli, Jackson and Lenoard we still took you to the wier. HEAT SUCK
dschad118::And Lebron can only win one title. What a $@%!$ @%! $@%!$. Duncan got one in his first year and kept winning them!!! Every time Lebron takes a shot they blow the whistel and put him on the line. I would hope he could score twenty points a game whne he gets 15 from the line
thunderguy80::so go 2 your own board and leave this 1 to real fans
.KB24.::Yeah you'll see their comment count go past 50k tomorrow when they lose...
Butus 2.O::.KB24 loves bath salt
.KB24.::Okay... I'm a big Kobe fan obviously but:  Duncan at 36 &gt; Kobe at 34
I hate Jerry Jones::you must not have sipped any of the LA koolaid yet....good for you
Butus 2.O::You must be on meth
.KB24.::Hey man... Duncan has been amazing this year.  We got these articles about Kobe being "classic" and Tim Duncan isn't getting any love for being even better and actually winning.
KobeAt34IsBetterThanLebronWillEverBe::Nice chatting with you guys, good luck the rest of the season Spurs, the lone OKC fan in here, and the only Heat fan as well.  Lakers out!
FadeBackShootAirBall4::have a nice night
thunderguy80::later
Butuss::Bye, have a good one.
thunderguy80::KobeAt34IsBetterThanLebronWillEverBe - Um, the OKC game was close until we didn't score for the last 5 minutes.  LA can hang with any team in the League, and will show you in the playoffs.  so whats your excuse for losing to the Spurs,Clips,Denver and Memphis?
KobeAt34IsBetterThanLebronWillEverBe::We played Mem real early in the season, Den and the altitude and a back2back was our downfall. The Clips have smoked us, but playoffs they will suck, and both Spurs games were close.
8486Chase::Lakers can hang with anyone? LOL!!!!  they will get their $@% swept by the Spurs
Spurz2013champs::Kawhi Leonard 2014 All Star
dschad118::Kawhi Lenoard Is the future of the NBA. Imagine how good he will be when he is the face of the franchise for the spurs. He's already having huge nights when hes the fourth option on the team.
Butus 2.O::on 2k14 for PS3
TRUUUU_SPURZ::5 hour energy &gt; Meth
Butus 2.O::-Clowns
Butus 2.O::Spurs will win the finals!   -Sarcasm
8486Chase::I was talking to Thunderguy80, but ok. ps, is slam gone for life
thunderguy80::don't be a homer and ignorant be a realist and objective...either team can beat the other...will be a good series like last year
8486Chase::Your not a challenge. You only beat us last year because you cheated
Butus 2.O::Relax I'm the fake Butus 2.O
8486Chase::Shut up, your just jealous
Butus 2.O::I'm jealous my team isn't as old as the Spurs.
thunderguy80::remember Spurs still have 2 go through OKC.....
8486Chase::Spurs will win the finals! -Slam
TRUUUU_SPURZ::Can't wait till Spurs resurrect Greg Oden's career next year.
8486Chase::GO TALONS!!!
thedrwolff::Tim Duncan    GOAT status making all others look like clowns.  So why do so many bigs suck past 35????? Because they relied on size only  (SHAQ) and not on the ability to play basketball.  With respect to Kareem who without the skyhook would've had to retire at 38 but still played decent Defense at 40....I havent seen anyone play this well at this age except GOAT himself.
thedrwolff::Kobe fans $@%! bricks at the thought of Duncan getting number 5 to make Kobe look like the hands down second best player of his own era....
Spurz2013champs::OMG, please oh God please don't let us have to play the Lakers in the playoffs  - No one
FadeBackShootAirBall4::the lakers can be a 8th seed..7th seed or 6th seed and it wouldn't make a difference because they will still have to face spurs OKC clippers  they've struggled to beat all 3 teams this season..so either way your going home in the 1st round it will either be in 5 or 6..I wouldn't be surprised if they get swept.
thunderguy80::wow...your being generous....
FadeBackShootAirBall4::lol yeah I feel bad for lakers fans
thunderguy80::struggled they're 1-2 against OKC and have yet to beat the Spurs or Clips...that's not struggling that's getting dominated
FadeBackShootAirBall4::if only you got W's for hanging with a team the lakers would be a 5th seed right now
KobeAt34IsBetterThanLebronWillEverBe::Um, the OKC game was close until we didn't score for the last 5 minutes.  LA can hang with any team in the League, and will show you in the playoffs.
FadeBackShootAirBall4::I'll give them 1 home game against the spurs and that's about it
Butuss::...Apparently uploading team logos is against the rules..
Butus 2.O::yah man too bad for us
Spurz2013champs::the Crapaliers are who we thought they were. Thank God for TD
rj-rees63::you beat them by 6... with out kyrie... you guys wouldn't have won just saying...
KobeAt34IsBetterThanLebronWillEverBe::FadeBackShootAirBall4 I agree, I've asked the same question..why does the media continue to hype this awful team who's shown us nothing since the start of the season, they're last signature win was about 2 months ago against OKC ===============================================================  Didn't LA just go into Indy and beat the #2 seed Pacers without out best player, the same team who steamrolled the Heat 2x and held them to 79 points?
thunderguy80::even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while!
FadeBackShootAirBall4::lmao Indy is a signature win?  the same Indy team the heat steamed rolled a week ago
KobeAt34IsBetterThanLebronWillEverBe::You right we don't.  We will be more battle tested in the West, going through the likes of OKC, SAS, Mem, Den, LAC, Hou compared to Indy, Celtics, Knicks (overrated)
FadeBackShootAirBall4::to bad you don't have to go through Indy to make it to the semi-finals
KobeAt34IsBetterThanLebronWillEverBe::We beat them in Indy, the Heat couldn't. Yeah, you beat them at home.  Indy sucks on the road, but they are 1 of the better home teams, like it or not.
FadeBackShootAirBall4::the same Indy team that just loss to the 24 and 40 sixers
Butuss::I just realized these boards are a part of the "Walt Disney Internet Group" LOL!
Butus 2.O::Me too yo LOL
Tian Sang::KOBE KOBE KOBE KOBE KOBE KOBE KOBE KOBE KOBE KOBE KOBE
UNCASABLE::If Tian would have jumped on the other boat and ended up in the Gulf of Mexico he would have been a Spurs fan
sport medic::The free Wi-Fi is such a great benefit to working at McDonalds.
Butuss::Don't cream your sheets Tian.
thedrwolff::Boston has had enough games now for no one to DENY...Rondo is by far the most overhyped player EVER.  His scoring INefficiency of those  "GREAT" triple doubles where he goes 15 11 12 on 14 shots.....90% of his assists were a function of the offense running through him only on EVERY possession....and instead of your point guard shooting below 27% on 3's and NOT drawing fouls you get 10-15 shots a game by MUCH better shooters.  I've been saying it for 3 years now...Rondo doesnt help that team win...now...the stats don't lie
TRUUUU_SPURZ::Boston has some good problems.
