zackdaddy85::I Agree john wall has done everything he could for the team put around him the management doesn't care at all about this team. or else they wouldn't of drafted jan Veasly and kept lewis and not wavied blatche
zackdaddy85::Free John Wall
mwrigley7::Best of luck to Fab Melo and Jared Sullinger! Check out my in depth analysis and thoughts about each of these two great college players here: http://destination4sports.blogspot.com/
Bexindy55::Conference Finals match-up right here.  Book it.
Double it up::Wizards need either Davis or MKG if those 2 not available Beal or T-Rob
HateBrass::Get us Yancy Gates in Detroit next year.
randyf10::Please no, we can do better with our second round pick, I'll take him as an undrafted free agent, maybe
thanbai206::we need to file a complaint or something because games are obviously rigged .... anyone remember MEM vs GS game... down 4 33s left and no foul with the final score at 98-94
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Idiots, Wall needs help. He needs an offensive player.
DilyDodle::Blatche was his Cousins, til he Blatched all over himself.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::None of you are real Wizards fans anyway. He needs a Cousins or Davis.
Agent Zero7::too bad Wall is inconsistent himself, Im not sure if he reached double digits last game
adajwiz::If the Wizards can get Anthony Davis next year they will be in business. Wall owned knight tonight, even though they lost again.
SmokeBangout::Detroit is my team but it gets on my nerves that they wanna win games towards the end of the year messing up they lottery chances id do like cleveland did if i was them wtf !!!!!!!!
thanbai206::nba are officially rigged as of today.... this is ridiculous to watch the game... too much actors on the court...
angry b-ball fan::I often feel like games are rigged as well - especially watching teams like Miami who seem to get away with everything and get to the line for basically nothing.    BUT, when two teams like Detroit (my favorite team) and Washington play...I don't think there's any rigging going on.  I mean come on - it's not even nationally televised.  Neither team is going to the playoffs, and truthfully, not many people (aside from each teams respective fans) care about the outcome.  Detroit have won 3 straight, and haven't moved up in the lame "Power Rankings" one spot.  According to Hollinger, teams move up by recent play.  Makes no sense.

mark_aggs::stuckly had 3 fouls for detroit in the last 2 minutes, wtf was that about
mark_aggs::clearly obvious, how do they get away with it, that is what i want to know
DetroitSportsFan90::Where was Greg Monroe that whole 4th quarter?
mark_aggs::dude, you cant put a guy in who is scoring when you need to win by less than 8, dont you get it
scottieb1381::Wings lost, Tigers won, our horrible Pistons won. Pretty good day.

dfafafaf::Where is monroe???????? he made 7 Rib, right?
metsnlchampsxxx2012xxx::When the Wiz went down 20 I pretty much gave up... Roger Mason saved this spread along with Wall of course
mark_aggs::incredibly blind
mark_aggs::seriously, what gane did you see?
mark_aggs::the refs saved it, 5 fouls for wash in last  2 minutes
talkinwolves3325::What the hell happened to Monroe?
mark_aggs::the only move is to do what vegas say, this is all about $
DetKoolAid::Ben Wallace plays better D and rebounds better frank has been playing ben a lot more down the stretch and it has proved to be a pretty good move
XstreamINsanity::When your team is up 20 with less than half a game to go, you sit down your key players and let the reserves play some.  You don't keep someone playing so they can have a monstrous game if the game is well in hand.
t casey::When your best player is onhis way to having a monster game with 18 points and 7 rebounds in just 20 minutes, you don't sit him. You keep him in the game as much as possible.
mark_aggs::he was scoring when Detroit was not supposed to score
dlions663::Pistons now 17-13 since starting the season 4-20
sucrapi88::Detriot looks to be a very good up and coming team. With a good pickup they'll compete for a playoff spot next year.
HateBrass::Yancy Gates is coming!
drewg1984::NBA needs to abolish all free throws except for on technicals and flagrants. Make it more like street ball!
mark_aggs::need fouls to get the cover right, it is the only way the refs can controll the game and spread for vegas
drewg1984::$@%! Vegas and the ship it rode in on
drewg1984::What's wrong with it? Viewership would go up so much.
Redwhiteandyellow::Are you stupid?
drewg1984::Unless you enjoy the game coming to a halt 50+ times a game. Speed up the game, speed up viewership.
dlions663::Now if the Redwings win, it will be a sweep for Detroit sports today.
James57933::red wings lost at home 2-1
HateBrass::So did Ferris State, who now plays for a title.
dlions663::Well at least the Tigers and Pistons won.
James57933::did dick bavetta keep the game close
mark_aggs::i mean it can't be more obvious, detroit fouls 6 times in 2 minutes wtf
