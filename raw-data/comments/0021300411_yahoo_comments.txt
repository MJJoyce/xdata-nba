Trace Mann::is there a team out there with a worse announcing crew than the Miami heat?
Commenter::Paul, I understand your lack of response. The Client always #$%$ first, and in your case second, third, fourth, etc.
Rowell::i thought Atlanta already win? but how it goes to overtime
Kim::2 free throws nine seconds left and yet last week when the pacers wanted the same thing they couldnt get it interesting.
Guest::The 4th quarter will be FT's. Guaranteed.
Ian::Does Chris Bosh know that he's playing basketball?   Wake him up.
Hoop Dreamz::The Hawks Coach is doing a great job....too great. I could easily find a way to tank this season away if i was the coach. Jabari Parker or Andrew Wiggins would fit perfectly in Carroll's spot. Atlanta has no other way of ever being Champion without throwing away a season. There is no other way of getting the top talented players to come to Atlanta. Getting in the Playoffs and losing early helps this team 0%.
JovannyB::Miami was not supposed to win that game, that game had mafia.
creep::The Miami bandwagon bus is running continuously.
- LJ::David Stern decided the game couldn't end until the Heat had won.
