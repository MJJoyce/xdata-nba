Uncle Dunk::Excellent game from the two improving teams and look like they are ready to replace the heats and the bulls. Excellent coaches for both teams and why mike brown was fired before in Lakers?? Stupid owner
James E::Anthony Bennett looked like a bum in college who couldn't translate to the pros and so far I'm right.  He reminded me of Derrick Williams who is also a bum without a position.
Rabbit::I see the great Kyrie Irving is on pace to lead another talented team to a lottery draft pick,   He's Good but way too ''Overhyped'',thanks to ESPN hype machine. How many excuses does this young man need it took LeBron three seasons to make the playoffs...
Terrence A.::Anthony Bennet making history.  Shooting 5% from the field (1 out of 20 FG).  Who wants to join the Busts wagon?
James::Wow, another stellar game from bennett...1 personal foul, 1 rebound, and 0-1 from the field. Awesome. Now he is 1 for 21...Great pick Grant!! I'm sure Lebron is watching this thinking "yep, I really want to be a part of that!!" BTW, just prior to the season, Philly was picked to possibly set the record for losses this year...If things don't change for this game, they will have beat the cavs twice in 2 nights and already have twice as many wins as the cavs...Off to a great season.
snoop::the hell cavs first round rookie doing he is worst then kwane brown.....
Derek::Nice to see Henry Sims getting minutes. He can do more than Bennett and Bynum can at this time.
Frank::Cavs: FG% 0.451    3pt FG% .419   If this continues... launching three point shots every trip is the statistical advantage...
Anton::This game is good for fantasy lol...
Kyle::Wow 33 shot attempts by Irving. And now I believe that MCW is the real deal.
