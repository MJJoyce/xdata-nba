DWoe23::george accused of being a dirty player, huh....mmmk
zsmitson2012::I feel like someone is actually going to get hurt the next time these two teams play each other... most likely somehow involving tyler hansbrough haha
kory311::Can we please put this season out of its misery?
mgdevin::Why did Dion Waiters only play 12 minutes?  Did he get hurt again?
quickbr0wnf0x::Sore knee, to be evaluated further.
DodgersRaidersBullsFresnoState::I know most might not agree, but Paul George is a future NBA Season MVP.
maze1on1::In the loss, all 12 of Cleveland's players had at least 1 point, 1 FG, and 1 rebound. I know that has to be pretty rare, just not sure how many times its happened.
jpietrz3::if you are a Cavs fan check out the latest post http://www.sportsngamez.com/cavs-cant-stick-with-the-pace/#respond. Not many good things to take away from a spanking. Good for the Pacers though, still seem to be a piece away from a championship unfortunately.
jpietrz3::if you are a cavs fan check out the latest sports column http://www.sportsngamez.com/cavs-cant-stick-with-the-pace/#respond. Pacers fans can read too to see how a Cavs fan felt about the spanking. Hope you guys can win a championship, but still seem to be a piece a way.
mackfactor::So you're saying that it's easier to win when you get points from your bench? *GASP*
Taco still needs a Q::I dont mind Green taking open 3's but damn just learn how to stop shooting when your shots are not going down!!!
PaulGeorgeisFuture::come on Gerald, please don't let this be a one time thing, be a big contributor down the strech
doc490::jason terry was killed tonight rip

Taco still needs a Q::Weirdo
jimmy188710::About time we gave Green some good minutes and he performed
USAman15::Gerald, please find your consistency. I'm not saying you have to deliver amazing performances every night like you did tonight, but at least have that mentality and confidence to deliver solid performances whenever called from the bench. This team needs you to perform well, especially with Granger's status up in the air. Great job tonight, keep up the good work!
Indians1028::GO BOSTON
Frank Vogel Is My Hero::Gerald... This is why we signed you!!! &lt;3 The bench gave me warm fuzzies :3
Rumrunner66::yup it was painful watching him for most of the year 1 good game doesn't make up for that
PaulXGeorgeX24::he hasnd done crap this year.  He has lost minutes to hans, johnson &amp; pendergraph
MasterOfLogic::You know, we have a lot of athletic players on our team, if they would just start slashing to the basket...
23187189::That is how we do it, cavs had no chance play like that.
jimkamlowsky::If the Cavs were a dog, they'd be taking him to the vet to be put down. Pathetic performance!
quickbr0wnf0x::Take out Hill, George, and Hibbert and see how well the Pacers would do.
YogaBeer::With Irving, Varajao AND Waiters out, makes it very difficult for the young team to compete.
BiggestHandsomeHoosierRELOADED::I liked how the Pacers drove to the basket tonight, but honestly the Cavs looked terrible.
BiggestHandsomeHoosierRELOADED::Dunkfaces for dayyyysssss
hoops 112hoping::What do you guys think of Jeff Green? He's probably better than anyone on our roster not named Paul George or David West. Which is bad because we need someone to matchup with him when he comes off the bench. Looks like Gerald Green and Granger are our best bets to guard him as reserves.  But what happens when Pierce plays the 2 and Green plays the 3. PG can lock ONE of those guys down but the other will have an advantage.
iownamicrowave::It's been a good night for the Greens.
hoops 112hoping::if we want to get to the ECF,  we've gotta beat boston. If we don't see them in the 1st round then in the 2nd round, we will. Especially if they draw the knicks or nets.
JollySwagman27::Personally, I hope the Celtics lose every game the rest of the year and miss the playoffs.
MasterOfLogic::Except tonight*
The One and Only Lee Collier::I think the nets might be a tough matchup. We haven't beat them yet and I hate to say it, but some of that has been due to officiating.
JollySwagman27::so much for boston beating miami
quickbr0wnf0x::Garnett sat out, and Miami had to mount a furious rally to win by 2.   Not entirely hopeless.
feeldabern::what happened to the pacers defense?
JollySwagman27::once they got up by 25 they brought in 2nd and 3rd unit players and relaxed.  we probably could've held them below 80 otherwise.
mnsportswopwopwahhh::the mods are out tonight
iownamicrowave::yes, we are.
hoops 112hoping::jeez i just saw Paul George's poster... nasty!!! Lance's dunk was also pretty good and Green well he's an alien. Really
The One and Only Lee Collier::True. Zeller got destroyed. Then he flopped, then I thought Lance dunked on him, but it was actually someone else
The One and Only Lee Collier::The Pacers just attacked all night long, finally they stopped settling for contested shots and 3s which was the reason they lost to the Heat, Lakers, Sixers, etc. Got some good production from the bench in the forms of G Squared, Jeff Pendergraphsanity, Orlando Magic Johnson, Auj Dgustin, Miles Plumlee etc. Great win overall, good game Cavs, I think it would have been closer had they been able to play Varejao, Irving, Waiters.
JollySwagman27::Even with those guys... it was Cleveland.  There's a reason they've lost more games than we've won, they aren't a very good roster.
JollySwagman27::Yeah if you guys can keep everyone healthy and Irving continues to develop, you guys will have some potent offense.
HunterF4444::We've been injury riddled and young all season. Next season look out.
mnsportswopwopwahhh::bout freaking time Indiana
Boris_Bryson784174::Draft it up:  http://tinyurl.com/nba-free-draft-challenge3
colts8733::hopefully this is a sign Gerald is ready to be our scorer off the bench, if we can get him to be that scorer we can be a very dangerous team come playoff time
JollySwagman27::yeah if he and Tyler are scoring and they can keep up the defense watch out.  our starting 5 can beat anyone in the league when they are on.
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::He still takes a lot of dumb shots.  They just all went in tonight lol.  Still beats Sam Young tho.
JollySwagman27::as long as we don't let the magic shoot lights out from long range tomorrow we should get ourselves a new W streak going.  So disappointed in the last few losses.  (esp to boston and LA as i hate them)
iownamicrowave::miles plumlee is actually steve winwood's secret love child.
NealIndy::Clap... Clap... Clap... Clap... Clap... Clap...
iownamicrowave::your sexual innuendo will surely get you banned.
billy6015::Earned your paychecks tonight  Thanks for the effort Cavs .
rk6326::Only weathermen and Cleveland players can do their job correctly 20% of the time and still make money.
DevinPacers4Life::You guys will earn one more April 9th
MasterOfLogic::HOW is that a foul on Boston?  Wade shoved the defender out of the way and got the call?
rk6326::I guess you haven't watched Heat games before.
crpbpbactcb::um... wrong board chief
JollySwagman27::I've hated Boston for a lot longer than Miami has been relevant I guess.  i don't hate the Miami Heat for some reason.
MasterOfLogic::I can't either, that's why I want Boston to win so badly.
JollySwagman27::"MasterOfLogic Um.... game's over slick"  slick should be in the HoF!  that is all.
crpbpbactcb::I'll give you that i guess. I can't stand miami/lebron
JollySwagman27::this game is over.. i'd rather talk to pacer fans about the bos/mia game on a board that isn't full of bos/mia trolls
MasterOfLogic::Um.... game's over slick
JollySwagman27::i turned on ESPN knowing that this game was on there without having to look.
JollySwagman27::Plumlee and Young combine for 0-4.  obviously Pacers are doomed.   :)
The One and Only Lee Collier::Don't hate on Plumlee
DevinPacers4Life::lmao samething i said man. Those are our go to guys in the 4th quarter.
Ignatz916::Where is the guy who hates Brooke Olzendahm?  I am gonna have Gerald Green stomp the crap out of him.
JollySwagman27::that's me.  i just don't like her.  I felt bad when they let stacy paetz go, as i had grown to like her over the years.  (stacy was bad when she first started too)
lboogie737::Ditto.
MasterOfLogic::You know, if they're going to keep trying to score in the final seconds, I think we should be able to also.
JollySwagman27::gg cavs.  gl rest of the year getting people healthy.
ctown8686::gg, gl to your pacers in the playoffs, at this point i don't even really care if we lose, kind of want to, all about them ping pong balls lol.
ctown8686::Uhh, no.. That's rich though coming from a Pacers fan.
JollySwagman27::so you can get screwed in the draft lottery by a better team in a larger market?
JollySwagman27::damn i wanted to hold them under 90
smartstud26::Like I said 50,000 Bos loses still
smartstud26::nice D cavs good lord
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::Plumlee plumlee plumlee plumlee!!!
TheOneAndOnlyKR::That possession is all I ever want to see from Plumlee in my life.
NealIndy::Maybe we can trade Ole Plums for a pack of double mint gum?! Okay.. I'll take a half pack of stale juicy fruit..
JollySwagman27::i could've done without that possession too.
MasterOfLogic::Refs trying to get the heat back in it.
rk6326::Stern is a Heat fan!
JollySwagman27::Green is possibly (likely?) going to end this game leading the Pacers in points.  didn't expect that at all.
TheOneAndOnlyKR::The rim clanks loudly whenever Gibson shoots.
fosterwhitlock::dont ever expect this from green again
DevinPacers4Life::I'm glad we left Green in. He needs to keep getting back into game flow.
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::Plumlee is balling.  Im going to buy his sneakers.
