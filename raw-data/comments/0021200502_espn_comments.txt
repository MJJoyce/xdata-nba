65tarheel::Why did phoenix draft kendall marshall if they are not gonna play him. I dont mean starter minutes but even a little time should be given to see what he can do.
erikdog23::Is it bad that I originally thought "Randolph's shooting" was meant to be a gun-related incident?
doof54::Technical question on a referee's call:  During the first quarter, Sun's running the pick and roll with Gortat setting the pick and Dudley with the ball.  Tony Allen guarding Dudley, Allen goes under the pick and shoves Gortat.  Dudley shoots and Gortat bumps him.  Refs call Allen for fouling Dudley. Allen did not touch Dudley.  Questionable whether he intentionally shoved Gortat into Dudley.  Was this the correct call?
trollvtroll::Memphis sucks!!  ~Lakers
smokeysaj::packed house huh?
amillogram::alvin gentry is a terrible coach... that mr mackey sounding fool needs to pick a rotation and stick with it.. he changes peoples minutes every night and never has the same personnel groupings.. how can you expect a team to be successful when they never have  a chance to build chemistry, and continuously have to play with the fear of losing their minutes if they take one bad shot... it makes all of their players second guess every decision they make... you cant play like that...
bamberg1977::Pistons had a chance to get Randolph same year Memphis got him, but they questioned his character and D. Damn what a mistake.
Benjamayne::21 points on 11 shots is pretty darn efficient.  rudy gay finally got 50% shooting too!
jebho::Negro please
knight_rider_1983::Double H always gives solid minutes
Grindhouse2413::he tends to foul too much but he can rebound like hell
knight_rider_1983::sure he can
Grindhouse2413::Should have asked this earlier but question Griz Fans....Do you think the players ever read these comments or maybe from the Grizzly organization? just curious
emthomasjr::Every once in a while.  Remember Chris Wallace last year stating that he got the idea to give Arenas a shot from a blog.
knight_rider_1983::yea
Grindhouse2413::interesting
knight_rider_1983::I could see a guy like Tony Allen reading these comments
knight_rider_1983::Great effort Grizz
Grindhouse2413::Zach was 9-11. VERY strong ZBO
TunaSauce16::Damn suns. When Tucker is leading the team in scoring something is wrong.
pedrobear1::Can we just wait and see till the playoffs till we blow the team up? If we show serious contention in the playoffs, and make it to the WC finals, the FO should be willing to pay the tax.
emthomasjr::Yes.  If Bayless was given a little more free reign, we would be MUCH better.  If he had been given the same latitude as Crawford and Bledsoe for the Clips from the start of the season, we would have 3-4 fewer loses (Phoenix, Portland, Philly, Pacers at least) .
Grindhouse2413::playing HH more, letting Marc rest. very very smart
pedrobear1::he wears down so rest is good for him
pedrobear1::Very true about Wayne. Hollins killed Bayless confidence earlier in the season but i liked the way he let him play tonight and getting Marc some rest.
JamesGetDownBrown::i agree, we do have a very great team when everyone is clicking on all cylinders.
Grindhouse2413::I think letting Mayo go improved the teams chemistry and I like Bayless and Ellington. Wayne is actually improving very nicely after his slump.
Grindhouse2413::agree with that. i would like to keep everyone for the season and see how far we go. we have the talent to go far.
Grindhouse2413::miss Pondexter, cant wait to have him back
Everyday im Shufflin 290::2 maybe 3 weeks
JamesGetDownBrown::yeah i havent heard much either
Grindhouse2413::dont really know. guessing three or so
JamesGetDownBrown::how many more weeks till he's back?
Not Not A Wolves Fan::wes johnson sighting!
GoTigers2015::I remember when the Grizz would finish the season with just 21 wins, oh how things have changed
pedrobear1::wasn't that long ago lol
pedrobear1::See what happens when we have good guard play. The team wins.
pedrobear1::which one?
Grindhouse2413::good game from TA too
pedrobear1::Bayless 7 reb, 6 ast 9 points
JamesGetDownBrown::true. bayless still hasn't gained too much of hollins respect i guess
pedrobear1::If hollins use him like he wanted Mayo to be then yeah
JamesGetDownBrown::bayless, that is....
JamesGetDownBrown::he should be able to average those number in my opinion
pedrobear1::Conley 9 ast 4 steals 7 points
Grindhouse2413::dam good game from our starting five. wish mike would have been a bit more aggressive but cant complain at all. only two three made though and by DA and JB. 21 wins baby!
GoTigers2015::I think if the Grizz would get a PG like Calderon, who was on the Spanish National Team with Gasol, it would be great, he's very efficient and plays within himself, good assist-TO ration etc
Grindhouse2413::trade TA and selby and wroten for him and move Bayless to the 2
JamesGetDownBrown::oh, and is rudy in trade talks again?
Grindhouse2413::so keep them and trade TA
Grindhouse2413::Zach is more popular than Rudy. Rudy is younger and more athletic though. Tough call
JamesGetDownBrown::it really is. i personally think get rid of Mo or DA for a solid 2 guard.
pedrobear1::thats basically the dilemma
pedrobear1::Team trying to get under the cap so his and Zach names are being dangled
GoTigers2015::NEVER GET RID OF ZACH, HE IS THIS CITY
JamesGetDownBrown::gotcha
JamesGetDownBrown::what's the word? any names floating around?
pedrobear1::none
GoTigers2015::if he has 1 bad game, people will show up, but legitimate trade talks? No
pedrobear1::yes
JamesGetDownBrown::bring it on kings!
GoTigers2015::As opposed to the Tigers, this team is much easier to cheer for
JamesGetDownBrown::nooo kidding
motifman79::hahahaha dude was getting Jared Bayless number lmao!!! He aint got time tho they gotta catch a plane lol
pedrobear1::Guard play was excellent tonight
Everyday im Shufflin 290::GG Suns fan (:
rc021363::Good game, Suns fan.  Grit N Grind Grizzlies!!!
Michael62451::$ in the bannnk!
bluewhitetitansfight::Good game to the Suns. GNG Grizzlies we have two important road games coming up. Go Grizz!
JamesGetDownBrown::out of curiosity, how have the phoenix fans been?
Grindhouse2413::honestly very cool
pedrobear1::no problem
Maximus_Zwann885108::Draft your nba team:  http://tinyurl.com/fantasy-nba-free-entry5
GoTigers2015::Phoenix has some good players, but when Dragic, who is a strong player, is your leading scorer, it's not that good
roy2daboy::GRIT N MOTHERFU..CKING GRIND GRIZZ!!!!!!!
Aliens Colonial Marines AZ::Suns are garbage just end the season I can't take it anymore they lose game after game
msrocz::I hate u phx under 90.5 dome
GoTigers2015::LOL MARC
Aliens Colonial Marines AZ::It pisses me off on how bad the suns play.
GoTigers2015::Suns, why you call for TIMEOUT?
matty2669::they suck
Grindhouse2413::to prolong the misery
motifman79::Did the drunk guy just ask Jared if he wanted to screw his wife? lololol
motifman79::oh I am watching it online... its showing the Suns telecast
Grindhouse2413::you at the game motifman cuz i didnt see it on tv
Grindhouse2413::Jared would be down i bet, haha
motifman79::Grindhouse2413 - Jared would be down i bet, haha  he was smiling real hard
motifman79::you didnt see it? lol
roy2daboy::What? lol
matty2669::grizzlies &gt; suns
The 1 Percent::no $@%! sherlock
GoTigers2015::is there a need to state the obvious?
pedrobear1::This lineup has floor spacing not that i don't like TA or he played bad. This lineup just opens the floor up more so the grizz aren't 4 on 5 on Offense
Grindhouse2413::exactly
bluewhitetitansfight::Marc Gasol is one of my favorite players on the Grizzlies, but he argues way too much with the officials.
roy2daboy::Cultural differences.
bulls7777777::suns are complete trash
GoTigers2015::Bulls scored only 71 against us, Phoenix might crack 80 if they are lucky
GoTigers2015::Might score 90 points this game, OMGGGGGG
The 1 Percent::Thank God the NHL lockout ended. Phoenix's only winning team will be back in action within two weeks
Michael62451::yea and they'll be outa town within a year! lol
The 1 Percent::More like 20. The sale to Jamison includes 20 years of free money to the Coyotes. They wont walk away from that
Joel100mill::Ii TOLD U SMART PEOPLE I MAKE 15,000$ A MONTH BETTING ON SPORTS
Michael62451::oh i know, chill with the caps lock dawg
Joel100mill::HAHA YUP YOU'RE RIGHT
Michael62451::nope now your probly gonna share some bogus link right? fuken loser lmao i'm a smart gambler? you know why? cause i play the sports i bet on at a college level, i know my shi t
Joel100mill::TO HELP DUMB  GAMBLERS
Michael62451::your full of crap bro, if you made that kinda $ u wouldnt be bragging abt it, you'd have bettert things to do then make up stories online loll
Joel100mill::REALLY U BELIEVE I PUT 12K ON THE CRAPTOR YOU'RE AN IDIOT DUMMY
Michael62451::lmao hes a fuken goof if he did
mikesunglasses::Thanks....I got back some of my losses.
IAMpunter0926::didnt you pick raps +6.5
bluewhitetitansfight::We finally look like ourselves again. Hoping this continues for more than just this game.
Grindhouse2413::we play like this, we can easily handle what SAC throws our way
roy2daboy::Z-BO!!!!!!!!!
GoTigers2015::I like this lineup with Jerryd and Mike
Grindhouse2413::true...his game in Boston especially. he was great there
Grindhouse2413::I dont know dude but a few homes games lately have seen more than a few TA meltdowns. I love his energy and his defense, no question. But if we struggle to finish strong OFFENSIVELY in the fourth, he should not be in
GoTigers2015::or just sub offense for defense, but i'm impressed with TA's passing ability lately, definitely looks to have improved
Grindhouse2413::Dude me too! No TA is nice!
GoTigers2015::to be fair, TA has been playing nicely lately, it's just with Mike on the floor, Jerryd can be more of a scorer
