tbest23::Did Wall do the Dougie...
Soonerhopeful1::To my understanding, all the Clippers players are happy and united in as complete team, all doing things together and all are happy friends, except maybe Billups with his injury...But even K Mart was speaking about what a tight team unity friendship they all have, backing up and covering one another..!  Who would have thought, that....  " Clippers would be a preferred destination NBA team ".?   " The Clippers"..!  Things have changed.
jacrabtree2::i just have two questions..is chris paul having fun yet and is lob city enjoying the show?
Zach4panthers::i remember when Rashard Lewis was actually good. Now he is a waste of space
t-roy_jenkins::damn, john wall cant shoot for sh.it....
shotcaller-22::true that bro i didnt know that doing the john wall meant bricking shots turning the ball over to
jgabaldon4427::Kendall Williams to Drew Gordon dunk was BETTER than the Chris Paul to Blake Griffin dunk tonight!!!
Soonerhopeful1::Ha ha....You're  talking about  Drew Gordon and Kendall Williams from the New Mexico Lobos college team...!   Comparing it to CP3 and Griffin of the NBA  !.. ha ha  your a hoot.!  .   Wow ,   What would be the odds, that  Mr. "jgabaldon4427" :  that he is not a New Mexico Lobos Homer fan..?  Million to one..?
ustna::No
Frank38443::JaVale McGee is pretty damn good. Never really watched him play because well.. I never watch the Wizards play lol. Vinny Del Negro needs to realize Mo Williams' hot streak a couple weeks ago was a fluke and stop giving him so many minutes. Foye isn't much better.. basically they will really miss Chauncey against quality teams.
Iamtheone0594::Well, i they end up landing JR Smith then that puts them right back near the top of the West and they have already showed that they can run with the Thunder.
WareTheTDsAt::Hes also played with CP3 in New Orleans.... So be a part of a team with Lin and be part of the "linsanity" or be a part of the Rise with CP3 and the clips??? Yea thats not a hard choice its CP3 and the clips.
ustna::@frank That is completely false. All signs are not pointing to NY
Frank38443::I'm pretty sure he's from NY also and good buddies with his former teammate Melo. Chauncey and KMart were his teammates too so maybe he'll feel bad for Chauncey and help out the Clips. Guess we'll see. Most people think NY though. Chances are he's seeing all this Linsanity stuff and will want to be a part of that.
Iamtheone0594::Clippers are the better fit but Knicks can offer more money.
Frank38443::That's a big if. All signs point to JR signing with the Knicks

dukfors24::The clitoris is a sexual organ that is present only in female mammals. In humans, the visible button-like portion is located near the anterior junction of the labia minora, above the opening of the urethra and $@%!$@. Unlike the $@%!$, which is homologous to the clitoris, the clitoris does not contain the distal portion of the urethra. The only known exception to this is in the Spotted Hyena. In this species, the urogenital system is unique in that the female urinates, mates and gives birth via an enlarged, erectile clitoris, known as a pseudo-$@%!$.

Robbro19::suck a D
kfultz42::blake griffin or kevin love?
BRAY5150::For all you guys who say all Blake does is dunk you need to watch some games and stop watching sportcenter. He dunks but isn't the point to try and get as close to the hoop as possible to get the best shot? He's 22 he will get better and yes he can hit a jumper if your actually watch them play.
Frank38443::uhh yeeeah.. let's just say his jumper needs a lot of work. quality jump shooters don't shoot 52% from the FT line either.
BRAY5150::I'm a clipper fan so Blake of course but Kevin love is the more polished player right now for sure
kfultz42::yeah K Love is putting up amazing #s
MNSPORTS93::K Love. Blake is the better athlete, but all he does is dunk.
2ndStringCoach::SINCE KEVIN LOVE is better I'll go with Kevin Love
BRAY5150::How's that 12.5 looking now?? It's over! Hahaha
bigdickjim::wiz ain't gonna cover..  damn it man......

Robbro19::lol llloserssss
Charles74116::Fade the bookie is a LAME site, LAME
