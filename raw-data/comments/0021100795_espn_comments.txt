phunky58::orlandoo havin all sorts of issues on and off the court, not a good time for all this.    and on a side note austin daye should be a starter on this pistons team he can do it all and the guy cant even get in the game some nights.
Paul96857::DOn't know Jon3717, Not a rivalry when they don't play often http://bit.ly/HWaxQi
theprodctz::PS: All you Detroit people saying Kwame Kilpatrick was a bad mayor... complete and utter nonsense. I always felt he got a bad rap from the people there... did pretty well with the resources that were available for him, imho.
Dwayne_Johnson23::Whoa what got into Glen Davis?
CandySparker::Hola Lotta Love!
Dwayne_Johnson23::SHUTUP

HiThere103::Howard's so bad, he was benched the whole game, overrated piece of trash, go fist yourself
TheCronoMasterMind::He's been injured for the past 2 games. Only his 5th game he's missed in his career due to injury. It's understandable.
yabbadetroit7169::umm detroit ftw??
jdthedjkc::When Detroit was in the finals those several years in a row, they had a squad of thugs. Yancy Gates will fit in just fine.
CheerstoLilWayne::really? Chauncey Billups, Antonio Mcdyess, Rip Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince, and Ben Wallace were thugs??? LMAO
HateBrass::Jerebko, Maxiel, Knight, Stuckey and Monroe are the five you build around and get Yancy Gates in the first round to have the talented big body in the middle. If you don't draft him, grab the small forward Moultrie from Mississippi State.
trademarktaz::yancy gates will not be taken by the pistons in the first round. i'd rather see maxiel return to the bench that's what he does best.
randyf10::How about neither, especially if we're in the top 10
Sniper_Brosef::STOP WINNING DETROIT!!!!!!!!!!  YOURE KILLING YOUR DRAFT OPPORTUNITY!!!!!!!!!!
Kev_010::Magics suck without Dwight.
zachary2587::pistons would of beaten the magic even with howard the pistons own Howard look at the past
TheCronoMasterMind::They didn't have Dwight, Nelson, or Anderson. They had a slow 4th quarter, otherwise it was a tie game after 3.
CheerstoLilWayne::Pistons didn't have Stuckey $@%!...
theprodctz::Attendance: 16,741  Take the first 1 off and you'll probably get an accurate measure of how many people were actually there tonight.
CheerstoLilWayne::maybe if they were playing someone other than the Orlando Tragic...the Heat, Lakers, Knicks, etc. games fill up the palace quite well.
CheerstoLilWayne::haha you're an idiot theprodctz
Jake_Linder::Didn't the Lions do really well this year? And what about the Tigers? Or the Red Wings? you know, the team that broke NHL history for 23 straight home wins, and a 21 year playoff record? yeah, Detroit obviously doesn't care about their teams.
theprodctz::Doubt that. Detroit's too broke to care about their teams.
jukepaty::Magic fans familiarize yourself with these results. after Howard gone next year, it'll be the norm.
jaffeyjoeblaze::no he doesnt realize that....hes a pistons fan
MagicBoltzRays::you realize he's under contract until 2013, right?
zachzach2020::I was tricked into staying here!  ~ Dwight Howard
m7mod247::no
Verfiederbrera::Good Job for the Pistons. They have been playing very well since the 4-20 start. I didn't even think these guys would get 20 wins all year and they are there with about 15 games to go. Not bad. I see them making a push for the playoffs next year and hopefully they have a good draft and can get a Big man FA that sees potential in this team.
MagicBoltzRays::we will give you glen Davis for nothing. nothing at all.
SFEST13::Glen Davis never scores that many points. NEVER. Scorekeepers must have been drunk.
DetroitSportsFan90::Whats with the Lions haters last time i checked Bears didnt even make the playoffs last year LMAO!
yabbadetroit7169::whens the last time orlando won a championship.. oh wait never
Rick-Da-Villain::When was the last time the pistons made the playoffs is something to laugh about in a basketball section...
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::I'm out I was joking with you guys, good luck in the playoffs :)
Ultras South::Yikes, the Magic are as two faced as it gets (Maybe the Hawks).
wingsfan1999::another double double for the moose
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::Call me when the Magic win a championship, that will take a while
DTangMF::we just cant win with Turk the bum and JRich the inconsistance
Ultras South::Epic Pic, Bro.
DTangMF::I say after next year, they will have chance
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::lol
DTangMF::Davis 31Pts, 10 Reb, 3 Stl, 1 Blk.... Think Bass can do that playing the starting Center role?
DTangMF::I admit Bass is better, but Davis fits better with Magic tho
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::no but he puts up good number every night, Davis had one good game
MagicBoltzRays::meh... maybe
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::Magic suck, that team is trash
patrickoreilly08::this is why there shouldnt be divisions....only 2 confrences.
DTangMF::a trash team has better record than u, what should we call ur team?
danstraindepot::are team is a 3 seed idiot
MagicBoltzRays::and we still have a better record.
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::our team is a fourth seed yours is a fifth seed idiot
MagicBoltzRays::The Red Sox are trash.
bradyandjrich::Magic need to be able to grind some wins...they gotta win games in the 4th quarter. That's three straight games they had control of at one point and could have won. They need to close out.
MagicBoltzRays::Thank god MLB starts tomorrow.
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::You clowns
danstraindepot::troll alert
DTangMF::are you SVG's twin brother?
MagicBoltzRays::Ron Jeremy's Brother.
Bede Bears 2::Boston, Orlando, and Detoliet all suck guys.   Only cities worth living in are NYC and Chicago.
CheerstoLilWayne::still better than Shitcago
DTangMF::NYC is dirty and full with homeless, and Chicago crime rate sky high, i say no...
openminded43::I'm from NY........ NOT!!!
SportsFan8916::Gotta leave this convo room cuz i feel like NewEnglandSportsFan is a pedofile looking at me. bothers me.
CheerstoLilWayne::believe me...no one's looking at you
openminded43::No, it's fun talkin' smack!!! But be aware of Nuggets fans...... they can DISH IT but flag you instead of taking it!!!
MagicalDiesel::They learned it from Tebow
DTangMF::I dont know why some of the DET fans are talking sh*t...Pistons is not even in the playoff...
DTangMF::yea, check the box score and tell me who played this game~
CheerstoLilWayne::hmm...I see that Stuckey was out... $@%! tool
yabbadetroit7169::shut up
CheerstoLilWayne::scoreboard
MagicalDiesel::How about those Red Sox?
openminded43::They S-CK!!!
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::lol 17&gt;0 keep talking haters
Btravisc::and a loss to THE GIANTS the best bad team ever HAHAHAHAHAH
SportsFan8916::I just pray Van Gundy gets fired within the next week or so ..much like he did with the heat..I'd rather take a playoff loss then go with Van Gundy again and have every other team predict every play..in the off season get rid of J-Rich  Turk and Davis..D-will or Nash would be a great pick man
14214555::you do realize van gundy is the only reason this team is above 500, dwight is great but van gundy has coached this team above its potential
trizzo23::you do dwight,anderson and nelson did not play and game was tied going to 4th...
trizzo23::nash is done...not many better than svg...he is top 5 coach easy
SportsFan8916::and Duhon's weak $@%
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::Im here cause the Celtics are not playing tonight
openminded43::Don't worry...... they play minimal B2B's and have the easiest schedule!!! Stern CARES!!!
MagicalDiesel::Boston Celtics: Old and irrelevant Boston Red Sox: CHOKERS!!!!!!!!!!!! Boston Bruins: Overrated New England Patriots: CHOKERS!!!!!!
HighSpeedTaijutsu::Trolling
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::lol hater All teams combined 30 title
MagicBoltzRays::yes that includes the title from 1918.
MagicBoltzRays::the last 3 Sox Titles are tainted.
MagicalDiesel::The last 2 Sox titles and a couple of the recent Patriots titles
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::none lol
MagicalDiesel::Who cares what they did YEARS ago. Nothing much recently and nothing anytime soon
MagicBoltzRays::how many of them are tainted?
pistonfanstill::Frank Groupies posing as Pistons fans. The Pistons have owned the Magic ever since Prince's rookie year.  It does not matter what their record it, who the coach is or what star player plays or not.  So go ahead with your champagne and champion celebration with the delusion that Frank has the team headed in the right direction.
pistonfanstill::Its going to take a full training camp with normal practice time for the reality that this is the coach who turned the Nets from consecutive Finalists to the perennial Lottery pickers they are now.  Gore hired Checketts who advised him to hire a NBA Walter Smitty Groupie for a coach.  After the next year Bill Davidson's legacy will be  where it was when Dick Vitale coached the team.
Btravisc::and a whole new team
wflannigan::Pistons fan until Death, and I will take it. A win is better than a loss in my book!
BluesStanleyCupChamps2012::frank is an average coach. that's all we need. we have great young talent.
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::LOL at the Magic fans
14214555::minus three starters id say this was a good showing for the magic
iFartInUrPillow::I'm not too concerned.  I'm happy that Davis finally started showing signs of life out there, and a lot of our normal bench players played well.  Considering they were without Howard, Anderson, and Nelson I'm happy with what I saw.
BluesStanleyCupChamps2012::why is a boston fan in here?
openminded43::LOL at your AVATAR!!! YIKES!!!
HighSpeedTaijutsu::Their pissed! XD
MagicalDiesel::They're*
Bede Bears 2::Lions won't make the Playoffs this year.
pistonfanstill::OK that leaves 0-16 Rod as your good luck charm.
pistonfanstill::But despite the tease of 7-3 b4 losing Cutler and Forte u r delusional to believe Marinelli and Martz are going to help the Bears.
Bede Bears 2::Good thing Martz is gone...
pistonfanstill::You maybe right.  Teams turned them into 1 dimension, Stafford to Calvin.  They had nothing else to close the season out with.
CheerstoLilWayne::Getting out top 3 running backs back form injury
pistonfanstill::From where?
CheerstoLilWayne::but this year, we get a running game
BluesStanleyCupChamps2012::will the bears even win a game?
Bede Bears 2::Yes... lol as if i know for sure that the Lions have a bounty system. They do seem like a team that would have one though.
BluesStanleyCupChamps2012::what bounty system? the one you just made up?
Bede Bears 2::Bears go 1
openminded43::Even C's fans have COME OUT for the 1st time this season!!! WELCOME BACK YOU HIBERNATING BEARS!!!
MagicalDiesel::They're still trash
MagicBoltzRays::J-rich and Redick = 14 combined points and we still almost won
Btravisc::Hey DET how are the LION,, have fun choking every year
HighSpeedTaijutsu::Orlando Magic
HighSpeedTaijutsu::at least your going into the playoffs!!!!
Btravisc::im pretty sure they got crushed
CheerstoLilWayne::and what teams from florida made it??? LMAO!!!!
Btravisc::are they......
HighSpeedTaijutsu::Your trolling because your team lost?
BluesStanleyCupChamps2012::lions are best in the league now. have fun living in 2008 troll
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::lol
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::LIons
DETsports84::Hey Orlando.....YOU PLAY LIKE A GIRL!
DTangMF::Check the standing, and please do realize that your team SUCK!
CheerstoLilWayne::scoreboard
Btravisc::hahahahahah
SportsFan8916::You can't Like your own comment bro
CheerstoLilWayne::3 likes for him...what was that?
SportsFan8916::Do Magic fans think D-will go to Orlando or to Dallas in the offseason?
pistonfanstill::D-Will would be foolish to go to the Magic.
Btravisc::MAgic
SportsFan8916::I don't think Nets are the ideal place for him to retire
Bede Bears 2::Neither. Net4Life
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::"Thank you for Bass"  Celtics fans
MagicalDiesel::Congrats for being irrelevant in the next 10 years.
MagicalDiesel::Is that all you got? Too bad this isn't 5 years ago you fat ugly loser
NewEnglandSportsFanNH2::good one, How many titles do Magic have ohh wait..
Papa Demba Cisse::Big Baby is such a clown. <strong><a href="http://hoopsgrind.com/2012/04/03/tuesday-gameday-observations-4312/">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rupz1hAH9X8</a></strong>
Bede Bears 2::Pistons, Chicago will trade you Derrick Rose, Carlos Boozer, and Luol Deng for Knight, Stuckey, Monroe, and Benny Wallace and every draft pick you guys have from 2012-2025.
CheerstoLilWayne::no, Detroit gets robbed
wflannigan::Joe Dumars, I was mad as hell at you early this season.  I apologize, it seems you really did get a good coach
pistonfanstill::Trading Billups was a head scratcher indeed but most fail to mention that Dice was also traded for AI.  What added to that was the hire of Michael Curry who was clueless as a head coach and began the frustration of Rip, Stuckey and AI over his indecision as to how to play them.  Because AI was a villain he took the fall for what was not his fault as he did not make the trade and was not responsible for Curry's lack of qualifications.  So the hire of Curry was the official beginning of the Pistons downfall not the choice of Darko or the trade of Billups.  Mistakes have been made but the run with a team of scrubs was very real too.
pistonfanstill::Dumars did not hire Groupie Frank. The Pistons roster was not as bad as people were led to believe. One of the reasons they are winning what they do win is because of Prince but I know you cannot see what he does not because most of you could not see what he did when the Pistons dominated the East.  Frank is not a good coach and he will prove that to you next year when teams have more opportunity to gameplan each other.
detroitrulez33::Let's see: Trading Billups, drafting Milicic over 'Melo, Wade or Bosh, trading for Allen Iverson, letting Ben Wallace go, not re-signing enough bench players after the '04 title season.  He's done a CRACKER JACK job as GM.
pistonfanstill::Darko has a ring but Melo and Bosh dont.  Wade had the fortune similar to Kobe's by landing on a team of faded superstars who had learnt from the Piston's example of Ensemble Starless ball, a still dominant Shaq who were hungry for a championship.  You can conjecture all you want about these players being Pistons but not a single one of you believed any of those Pistons would win and dominate the East as All Stars so dont try to do it in hindsight.
pistonfanstill::Ben Wallace got an offer he was not worth and thought about staying for less.  The Bulls overpaid him to break up the Piston's heart which still was not worth what they offered.  His teammates encouraged him to take the Bulls deal because of how much his large family depended on him.
BluesStanleyCupChamps2012::i am still mad at him
MagicalDiesel::Glen Davis showing that he can be trade bait. God I hope so
