uwisfan34::4 in a row, way to go Bucks!
PutYouOn::how do u cleveland fans like that lost lbj and the heat took by my bulls yeahhhhh
Mikegolick::Im a bulls fan. Been that way all my life. Just wanted to come into this board and say.... I REALLY WANT THE BUCKS TO GET THE 8th seed. Not because i know we'll win. But because the bucks deserve that spot wayyy more than the knicks. So for now... Go Bucks!
Springfresh3::8 turnovers for Kyrie
panther4406::i hate that they're playing so well, because they need lottery picks to contend.  Unless you're the Lakers (or Miami, which doesn't count), that's the only way you're going to contend for titles in the NBA... (See: Orlando, Oklahoma City, Chicago, and next year, Minnesota)
dpackrules::The bucks have been the worst drafting team the last 20yrs!! If they were smart they would give a player and ALL their picks next year for Howard! They would be good enough to win the championship this year. So what if he walks we won a championship!! Like i said we can't draft anyway and with the Ellis trade we are set for another two years with great talent!
panther4406::you've been posting this for two days dude
Birdmann._.::wheres monta ellis?
cyclonextrem::He plays friday
ChiefWahoo1995::If the Cavs trade Sessions to the Lakers they better get a number 1 in return.  The Lakers need him bad, make them pay.  check this out - http://www.lakecounty-sentinel.com/index.php?p=51_38
cuckercrazy::howard asking for nash if he's gonna stay... could be lethal.. rest of the league better watch out for orlando http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
shawnperi::Dear ESPN,    11 stories in your "headlines", not one of them mentions tonights triple double.   Shamefull
WiscoMase23::what do you expect from the east coast sports promotional network?
kirsty125521::omfg!  38 assists on 46 fgs!! sick!  go bucks!
screwhead2305::Bucks looking like they could do some damage this season.. idk about the trade for Ellis.. If Jennings can improve his decision making and not jack up 20 shots when he isnt hitting his shot..
alexad202::Gooden look as good as LeBron with that stat line
323BrownPride::and just wait for Monta to get in the rotation...should be nice
navyctr312::anyone for Marecic to playing a LB roll?
Aj13721::I like the Bucks new starting 5 and Dunleavy. They could finish above .500 now
cdro225::How does this sound  Cavs Get: Andrew Bynum, Luke Walton Lakers Get: Ramon Sessions, Antawn Jamison, possibly 2012 second round pick
BBIC5151::5.8 millions dollar for 1.7 points per game.  whopp de fucking doo.
Br3tt11::Bucks need a 6 seed to have a chance, but an eight is better than a seven.
KingGeorge53::Congrats to the Bucks and their fans.  Go Cavaliers!   (think ping pong balls!)
CLEVELANDCBI::Honestly can't wait to see Ellis suit up for Milwaukee myself.  They'll have the smallest backcourt in the league, but it'll be fun to watch.
CLEVELANDCBI::Whenever I'm having a lousy day, all I have to do is look  at Ryan hollins' stat line.  Bob Eucker on Major League's line, "That's all we got, just one God#### hit?" goes through my head every time.  I just substitute "rebound" or "points" for hit.  Gee is looking good though.  I think we've got a guy with a lot of upside in him.
tpeserik13::We're going on a tear once Ellis suits up. 7th seed, here we come!
dcenate2012::This is why you share
dcenate2012::Did the Bucks give Kwame his jersey yet??
Malcyon1::His current contract expires at the end of the season, plus he's most likely out for the year.  Bucks will just cut him, they only picked him up because he gives Milwaukee a better Cap Space differential.
-FEARTHEDEER-::i'm not sure he's even gonna get one unless he buys it from the jersey customization store. There's a chance he won't even play for milwaukee
tpeserik13::I already ordered one.
tribefan123456::That awkward moment when you start, play 22 minutes, take 2 shots, and score 0 points...
quickbr0wnf0x::Hollins scored 2
Br3tt11::Parker or Hollins?
Strong Troll Orthenthald::Generic player triple double
cland4ever::kasasa finds me the fruits to my labor
I fought the law...and the law won.::How about that Byron Scott? He is easily the most pathetic coach in the NBA. And Cleveland fans are so stupid they believe in him.
KingGeorge53::Byron Scott is easily the best coach the Cavs have had in a long time.    Wilkens and Karl being two of the best.     We'll see how Scott ends up with the Cavs, but man, w/o Scott, the Cavs easily have the worst record in the NBA.    Talk to any NBA scout and they'll tell you that this team works harder than most for 4 Q   AND the work as a team.     Something very rare in the NBA
Alex818728::well your either a troll and a idiot,
quickbr0wnf0x::I all but am stunned to silence by the sheer stupidity of this remark.
I fought the law...and the law won.::If you are so stupid that you still believe in him and think I'm a troll...you should really stop watching sports because you might be a Cleveland fan.
navyctr312::troll

CLEVELANDCBI::Drew Gooden got a triple double?  Good for him I guess.
Strong Troll Orthenthald::Generic player triple double
WiscoMase23::he got it in 3 quarters

yata9arasu::Wow......  Fouling Bryant on a 3 up 3 with 20 sec to go.......

bjonthe493rd::why in the world did kyrie irving not play the last 4 minutes of the game. it's obvious that scott wants the team to lose. man
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Trying to play up Sessions' trade value?
Alex818728::build up sessons trade value
Alex818728::Cavs need a big Center to cover up paint, and move varajao back to pwer forward
quickbr0wnf0x::How about someone to rebound???  No one had more than 5 rebounds.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Varejao on the floor would be a good first step.
cdro225::Just loOked at sessions line. Not very good for his last game as a cav
Alex818728::hopefully
