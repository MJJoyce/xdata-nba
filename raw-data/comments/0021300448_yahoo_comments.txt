PKM::Warriors should dominate these weak teams.
Alf::Poor decision not to foul Irving with few seconds left. You have 3 point advantage and less than 10s left go foul before he throws. Good win overall- Go GSW!!
Eat Healthy::In this game, several poor decisions were made by the coach. There was no need to push the key  players into overtime. Having Bogut play in overtime if he is able, makes life easy for he will block key shots and tap in soft easy misses. Clevland was lacking their center and yet they got off to a good start because of poor defense. Curry's percentage of shots made is dropping fast because he shoots way too much.
Seattle Blows!::i like these quality close wins...prepares the Dubs for the playoffs and high stress situations.
CYRUS C::bogut and lee goes two games with neither of them recording a dbl-digit rebounding total after like 12 straight games in which they both recorded double-digit rebounding game totals.
friendly_friend::Warriors couldn't dominate any team!
Ahia::mike brown fired by the LA management why the Cleveland  management are contenue believing his coaching style win or loss style..
C K::Bennett and Waiters are both big busts, the Cavs kept wasting their draft picks
Robert::Another solid, reliable performance by David Lee....
Lawrence::Cavs cannot buy a win.
