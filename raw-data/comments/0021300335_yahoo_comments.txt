Cyril::Jon Leuer is the second coming of Tom Gugliotta!  Just keep him away from the black market herbal supplements (google it).    Leuer is one of those players who got overlooked because he was a four-year college player with a low ceilling.  Teams prefer flashy young prospects with a ton of potential.  Leuer was a fan favorite in Milwaukee as a rookie, and was surprisingly productive as well.  Now he's getting the chance in Memphis and proving once again that he can play.  I don't think he'll continue putting up 15 and 8 every night, but he should be a rotation player in this league.
