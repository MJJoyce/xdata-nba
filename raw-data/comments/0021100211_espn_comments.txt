Anti-Stratfordian::Amaze76er why do alltime greats n active nba players take shots at lebrick?lol nobody respect him he had to go ring chasing with two other supestars for the easy way out....haha ------ "He's at the top. LeBron has that gift. Like Elgin, Oscar, West, Russell, Bird, Magic, Michael." <b>-- Julius Erving</b>  "I look at LeBron James the same way I looked at Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan." <b>-- Dolph Schayes</b>  "I may go as far to say LeBron James is probably the greatest player to ever play the game." <b>-- Scottie Pippen</b>  "LeBron is in a class by himself." <b>-- Oscar Robertson</b>  "He's as good as anyone that's ever played this game." <b>-- Larry Bird</b>  "He's one of the most gifted athletes in the history of athletes."  <b>-- Dolph Schayes</b>  "You can play him at any position -- forward, guard or center -- and he'll be outstanding and probably would make All-NBA at each one." <b>-- John Havlicek</b>  "He's one guy in the league that I think he'll probably be better than all of us when it's all said and done." <b>-- Larry Bird</b>  "His IQ is off the scale. He's so far ahead of the game." <b>-- Scottie Pippen</b>  "He has an amazing basketball IQ. You look at what he does outside of his scoring.  He's a great passer, a very, very good rebounder. He's got a great basketball mind." <b>-- Dominique Wilkins</b>  "He's one of those players who won't be denied. He's fearless on the court."  <b>-- John Havlicek</b>  "His basketball IQ is on the level of Bird, Magic and Jordan and their basketball IQ was off the charts." <b>-- Bernard King</b>  "He's a hybrid type of player that can play multiple positions. He can basically do whatever he wants."  <b>-- Dominique Wilkins</b>  "He's the most unique player to enter the NBA in many, many decades." <b>-- Bernard King</b>  "It just reminds me of coaching against Boston when Bird was a perimeter player then all of a sudden he went to the low post. Now, what do you do?" <b>-- Billy Cunningham</b>  "I don't know of any forward in history of the game who has ever had his athletic skills and his attributes that he has. There's no doubt about that." <b>-- Jerry Lucas</b>  "He can dribble, he can pass, he can score. He probably could coach if they allowed him to."  <b>-- Rick Barry</b>  "He's the ultimate unselfish player. He can score 60 points or 10 points, it doesn't matter because he'll still dominate the game." <b>-- Julius Erving</b>  "I guess a player comes along once every 50 years when we get someone of LeBron's skills."  <b>-- Dolph Schayes</b>  "He not only wants his team to win but he wants to dominate and prove that he's the best."  <b>-- Billy Cunningham</b>  "Detroit, Playoffs, 2007. Forty eight points, scored his team's last 25. Enough said." <b>-- Rick Barry</b>
Taco with a Q::26-8 in the 4th quarter????   Wow and another stat that pisses me off is that the kings had more offensive rebounds (30) than defensive (23)  THATS WHY THEY SHOT ONLY 30% AND STILL WON THE DAMN GAME!!!!!   I was very heated last night when I saw the collapse!  No excuse for losing this game!!!!
digglerdidum::SHOOTING 30% AND WINNING????????????  Welcome to today's NNBA.
Rmnica23::8 points in the 4th quarter?  yikes
Panthersboy2009::Trade danny granger and pick up someone more consistent.
greenbean47::Danny - please work on your shot selection.  33% is unacceptable!!!!
jahmarcusRuss2::for all you people who only saw the boxscore, go look at the free throw differential. that tells you the tale of the 4th. chalk up a win for the refs last night
enemy_80::lol..go figure the kings put everything they have into this game..too bad they don't do that every other game. way to show up for one game.
mwlevine::1-17 on 3 pointers, 8 points in the 4th Quarter is all you have to say. Terrible loss Pacers, inexcusable and embarrassing........
CandySparker::A cousin in Damascus : Cheers DeMarcus Cousins!
KSJezz::Demarcus Cousins just caught another offensive rebound.
MagicBoltzRays::LOL.... Pacers.
_Jimmer_Time_::I'm out, gn all. GG Pacers. Good, tough win. Later all, GO KINGS!
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::Why'd they try a lob to a guy who isn't that athletic?
_Jimmer_Time_::damn, cuck the flippers
_Jimmer_Time_::Dirk game winner?
_Jimmer_Time_::big shot
_Jimmer_Time_::who gets the shot?
_Jimmer_Time_::get a stop, beat the Clips
UK_Basketball_for_life::Jason Freaking Terry
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::JET Clutch
UK_Basketball_for_life::He is reaching Horry level
_Jimmer_Time_::lol Clippers
rhettfieldsted::Legitimately any chance the Kings trade Jimmer Fredette this season?
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::Depends on the jersey sales. They have to do research to see if he brings in revenue. If he does, he can sit on the bench. If he doesn't, then they might.
_Jimmer_Time_::Mavs playing for the tie of lead
UK_Basketball_for_life::Omri for Hickson?
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::Only if CLE throws in a 1st...hahahah
Bnoe1111::THANKS FOR JINXING YOUR WINNING BET MR I HAVE PACERS +4 HOPE YOU CRY YOUR EYES OUT
bballjogguy31::no such thing.
JohnQAdams76::Why is everyone so excited about Isaiah Thomas? Was it the 1 assist in 20 minutes of play? Was it the 1-4 shooting, 0-2 from 3? His inability to contest a shot? How about the missed dunk? No... the reason is because the announcer has the most annoying man crush on him. I hear he loves how Thomas gives him head without even having to kneel down... "OHHHH ISAAIAHHHHH"
curtless::He drives it and draws fouls and plays with lots of energy that inspires the team. You think that dunk didn't do anything? He's also a very good passer if you've watched him play before.
J Cougs::If they keep playing the 2/3 zone like they did at the end of the game Jimmer will be fine on defence. That's all he played in college
bertlewis32::Jimmer does play better with IT, but the team suffers on defense.
bertlewis32::How many fouls has he committed? Not many. He needs to step it up.
JohnQAdams76::Jimmer's D is not that bad, I've been watching him. Everyone is just regurgitating what media said. Actually, Jimmer is doing everything the scouts said he couldn't do (pass, create his shot, etc.) and none of what they said he could do (shoot). He just needs to get comfortable.
Ashotjan::I like IT because he's actually a PG, which is what this team needs. He should be out there at least as a 2nd unit with Jimmer every night.
JohnQAdams76::Demarcus Cousins is more of a PG than Tyreke
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::He is more of a PG than Tyreke, that's why.
middlet01::I wonder if Granger would still "rather play the Bulls"?
_Jimmer_Time_::There is a reason they kept Cousins over the coach
socal2092::Missing Udrih this year!
UK_Basketball_for_life::Unfortunately, they let Hawes, Casspi and Udrih go before letting Westphal go.
UK_Basketball_for_life::Missing Casspi this year...
_Jimmer_Time_::yeah
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::They should trade Tyreke or Thornton now. Too many chucksters.
_Jimmer_Time_::3 damn
jmoneybags17::8 in the last quarter? woooowwww
_Jimmer_Time_::coaching change has been helpful for Cousins
UK_Basketball_for_life::The coaching change has been helpful for the majority of the team.
_Jimmer_Time_::true
bertlewis32::not so helpful for jimmer.
towlie_99::did you see the turnovers..  it was like they were handing them the balls to dunk!
UK_Basketball_for_life::DMC is stead fast becoming a great player in this league.
dabulls2012::Great?!? He's getting better but still needs to grow up mentally and perform over a longer stretch to even begin to think about entering "great" territory...
dabulls2012::WHEN did Hibbert punish Noah and Boozer??? And Cousins shot 4-for-16 against the Bulls at home with the Bulls winning by 10...
UK_Basketball_for_life::Sorry Bulls dude. he just punished Hibbert, who punished Noah and Boozer.
Shanet5050::Must be close to a record that .8 points
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::Danny granger for Monta Ellis.
UK_Basketball_for_life::Danny Granger for Nate Robinson?
towlie_99::danny granger for a nickel ..?
NGplayinskillz::H3LLL NO. Danny Granger for Eric Gordon is More like it.
dabulls2012::So NOH should give him away for a chucker with a longer contract ($27 million over next two years AFTER this season) instead of gaining valuable salary cap space if they don't resign Gordon...boy, sign you up as the next GM.
NGplayinskillz::Granger is from New Orleans. Plus it doesn't really matter anyway seeing as Gordon is a free agent this offseason.
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::Why would NOH trade Gordon for a more expensive, proven non-clutch Granger?
dabulls2012::More like Danny Granger for Keith Bogans...dude is a chucker and is shooting 33.5% this season...BRUTAL!
towlie_99::i pity the pacer fans.. haha what $@%! team they have to support..
Umblahum::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=463f9vIeO6E
lagunaking::Jimmer and JJ to Jazz for Paul Millsap
johnnyx2011::utah might take it b/c jimmer played college there lol
towlie_99::paul milsap is there daddy.. why wuld he move to such a crap team
socal2092::Did anyone see the 5'8" Thomas dunk? Well, he did not get the point but he still dunked it. Amazing!
Astrohusky::He dunked over a 6' 9" forward at UW in a dunk contest.
_Jimmer_Time_::Griffin = poor mans Shawn Kemp
Astrohusky::I don't hate Jimmer, but he needs to grow a pair.  IT is 5' 9" and tries to dunk on people and had 8 FTs this game.  Meanwhile Jimmer has taken 13 FTs the entire season.
towlie_99::wow i wasted like 7 straight hours.. all other teams i picked won.. and these pacers just stood there. letting the other team win
bertlewis32::I care towlie. Im sorry your team lost, and that it made you sad. Chin up youll get them next time.
towlie_99::how was i to know .. that the $@%!$@ pacers would loose to an even shittier kings
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::If you played a 5-game parlay, you would have won.  Learn your lesson.
towlie_99::shut up you $@%!
NGplayinskillz::NOBODY CARES.
jamesaustere::DMC with 10 offensive boards in the first half. Beast mode.
Ashotjan::Tyreke, Thornton, Cousins to Utah for 3 1st round picks, a bag of old bball shoes, and 12 sticks of deodorant.
Ashotjan::The cat doesn't want to be in SAC. So yeah.
UK_Basketball_for_life::Westphal is gone and that feeling has changed.
jahmarcusRuss2::how bout just trading jimmer cuz he is useless
Ashotjan::I'm not sure how his minutes are his fault. Do you realize what you're saying? Under Westphal he got 25 min and was productive. Under Smart he has shot worse but he's still a playmaker, but is benched for poor shooting when Reke and Thornton throw up crap all game with no consequences.  I'd suggest you try some patience.
UK_Basketball_for_life::What do you think he was drafted for? Not six minutes a game.
Ashotjan::Well how many lottery picks ever end up being franchise players? 5, 10, 20%? After 15 games you're sure he's just Steve Kerr? That's quite a leap.
UK_Basketball_for_life::I don't lottery pick a non franchise player. Do you?
jahmarcusRuss2::one trick pony....and you stick to the lamest disses: "you like your own posts" and "you live in your mommas basement". wheres your logic now?
Ashotjan::Who called him a franchise player? Is that why you bag on him? Because of perceived expectations? For the record Jimmer can get his own shot, Kerr, JJ, Morrison, et al never could.
UK_Basketball_for_life::I like Jimmer, I just don't think he is a franchise player. Sorry. He is a Steve Kerr.
Ashotjan::ur a one trick pony. You hate Jimmer. we get it. Troll elsewhere.
jahmarcusRuss2::HA next time use the "you live in your mamas basement joke too" you're so funny i'll like my post twice since that is possible right?
UK_Basketball_for_life::I liked his post.
Ashotjan::it's fun to "like" your own posts isn't it?
_Jimmer_Time_::Gamblers, the first step is to ADMIT you have a problem
UK_Basketball_for_life::888-GA-HELPS
boilercrazy2010::8 points in the 4th?
Astrohusky::I guess the pace of the pacers is slow!
socal2092::I can always count on the gamblers to be a killjoy for us Kings fans whenever we win! Seriously, you guys should eat more ice cream and stop gambling!
jahmarcusRuss2::are you 10 years old picking parlays over 3 teams....what a scrub
towlie_99::got every other pick right!
towlie_99::lost me a 10 team parlay
towlie_99::efff youu,  kings are garbage.. and pacers suck even more
towlie_99::i feel like blowing every player in that team.. what is wrong with them.. 8 points in a quarter.. isthat for real
Isaiah v2::you couldnt blow hibbert
UK_Basketball_for_life::5 dollar suckie suckie
towlie_99::you lost a bloody garbage team.. i got all my difficult picks right
towlie_99::wow paceer.. you suck!!! cost me my bet.. this has got to be a fix
towlie_99::pathetic pacers!!
bertlewis32::yep it was me. I fixed it all muahahahahah
middlet01::Really pacers? Sacramento garbage....ya'll need to stop worrying about trying to keep up wit D.Rose and DA BULLS and focus the teams in front of u.  Ya' ll get close to getting some respect then ya'll go out and lose to Sacramento....Pathetic!!!
Taco with a Q::Talking to a bulls fan is like talking to a child....they dont listen and they only whine and cry
jahmarcusRuss2::how about you watch the game and stop looking at boxscores moron
chubby rain::The logic is the Pacers are overrated, that's the logic.
jahmarcusRuss2::what logic did you use genius?
jahmarcusRuss2::not gonna even bother trying to communicate with a bulls fan
dabulls2012::Why did the game on TV show the Pacers win?
middlet01::The Bulls played the kings already...like I said ya'll garbage!!!
