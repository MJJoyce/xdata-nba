Isaac M::I'd like to say we only lost because Vucevic was out, but so was Kyrie Irving... so at best we could've hoped for the same deficit had both played.
CSONKA_39::Cleveland should have a double digit scoreboard for the home team, save on electricity.
Cyril::Oladipo shot 3-9, committed 3 turnovers, and only had 6 points in 25 minutes...and he still outplayed Bennett!
Guest::Cleveland, Orlando, Philadelphia and Brooklyn are all in a race for the 8th seed in the East. At .323 they are only 2 wins away from it. All 4 of them play tonight. Which of the 2 will only be 1 game away from the playoff spot?
JJ::talk about a dramatic comeback by the Cavs!
Vlad::varejao should put up big numbers now that bynum is gone. goin for 20 rebounds. nice
Larry::Earl Clark is worthless.
Ron::Anthony "Draft Bust" Bennett either needs to be Traded or sent to the CBA for more experience.
Loosie::Holy sheet!!  anthony bennet looks like a crazy ape!!
Lawrence::Play Sims coach. Zeller, Gee and foul prone Bennett are doing jack squat.
