bgood2life::Rudy Gay, has made a difference in the Raptors turn around success.
IJoe::Bucks are doing exactly what their fans want. Tanking for draft picks. They certainly picked the best coach to make them lose lol. Their rotations are an absolute disaster.
PKM::So Middleton is starting again?
Terry::Whoa, the Raps have been reincarnated. One big offensive weapon away from being a serious contender?
Michael::This is absolutely worst team in franchise History ! I don't think they will win another game. How much are they paying these guys?
Mr::I don't understand. Why are the Bucks so bad? They have decent players. Is it the Coach? Are the players not motivated? Sure they may get a top draft pick but which top player would be motivated to play for such an organization?
HeyHoody::OK, I haven't seen the Bucks play this year, but -- seriously -- how are they this bad?  It's understandable that they might be under .500 with so many new players, but they're Bobcat bad.  Even if they had no chemistry at all, they should be 6 games better just on talent alone, right?
bgood2life::Rudy #$%$, whenever you return back to Toronto,prepare yourself to receive a standing ovation.
Fred Derf::The Bucks will probably get the 1st pick in the draft.  Any suggestions on who the Bucks should take and why?
RAY B::What ever happened to Landry Fields? He has played 5 minutes over the last 14 games...He has made about $450,000 over that time period...For 5 freakin minutes!!
