Dachargers21::I wouldn't mine the Lakers making the playoffs as the #8 seed they might knock out OKC which will give the Clips a better chance at winning it all! I think the Spurs with all the Injuries are done! Denver without Gallanari our in Trouble! I hope Cp3 and Blake Dominate the playoffs this year! I don't trust VDN!
Justin00247::clippers gonna kill griz
JoeClipplet::Memphis fans saying, "Show some respect" LOL...   Last years grizzlets were OBNOXIOUS...  - JC
MemphisSwag::Show some respect.Nobody will dominate in this series,it will come down to the end in every game.Maybe one blowout for each team.
San Diego Clippers::Hopefully Jamal will win the sixth man award.  He deserves it over JR Smith.
San Diego Clippers::Good Job Clipps
gt1master_ike::Kudos to the Clippers. But man, the West is deep as it has ever been. Who would have thought 5 teams would win 55 or more games this year. That hasn't happened in the West for a while.
jam6484::Heat will repeat
gotmyjd2003::Kudos to Kevin, the fan who hit the half court shot! Crowd was going absolutely nuts!
jack frrom the titanic::Only way I'm not watching the knicks playoff game is if Olivia Wilde knocks on my door and says lets get it on
jack frrom the titanic::Blazers should trade lillard for Amare &amp; Felton  Knicks Fan
jack frrom the titanic::Maurice Lucas
sk0dawgs::blazers aint messin around when they're in tank mode
bojo87::Why should we? lets get them rooks in there to see what we have! What did we learn? Maybe Barton can score off the bench if he takes enough shots.
Clipper Nation Stand Up::Watch out, West... Clips are comin' for ya!
Antsea91::lol
Chadwik93::People who claim the denver is just so much better than the clippers... really, whats the difference?   Almost identical records and the 3rd and final game of the series which DEN won was the second of a back to back for LAC in denver. The game was tied at halftime and the clippers were tired in the 2nd half.   Thats what you're claiming dominance/superiority with?  Clippers going to be on a 7 game win streak as well.
michael107117::I couldn't fault anyone for picking any of the teams in the West 1st round series especially picking against the top 3 seeds, none of them are playing above and beyond Houston, LA, and Golden State. I could see any of them getting knocked off in the 1st round
Resident_Guido::Any of the top 4 or 5 teams in the west could wind up in the Finals -- it's a crap shoot.
Factoids R Us::agree with the exception of OKC...will have little trouble with Houston, LAL or Utah
Factoids R Us::Anything is possible :)  The beauty of playoffs!  GL to whoever ur pulling for  Later--Bed time!
michael107117::Utah wouldn't, but if Dwight and Gasol continue building chemistry without Kobe dominating the ball they could cause problems for OKC. And Harden would step his game up even more vs OKC and give them a tough time
LifeInInfrared::More so than the Lakers?
Izaman5000::The Rockets could give OKC fits.
Giant_Niner::Clippers are a fun team to watch
Factoids R Us::West:  1. OKC - done 2, SA - done 3. Denver or LAC 4. LAC or Denver 5. Memphis -done (but could get HCA over LAC) 6. GS or Houston 7. Houston, LAL, or GS 8. LAL, Houston, or Utah  East is all set except the Bulls (5) and Hawks (6) could flip-flop
Izaman5000::Cliff notes!!

Soonerhopeful1::Would be nice to see a   Knicks Vs  Clippers NBA finals..!  Entertaining and Big TV draw.
Soonerhopeful1::Nuggets are not better... Denver would not have the better record, if not for its home court altitude record... Which mostly will disappear in playoffs, with multiple days rest between games, allowing team to acclimate in Denver...     You cannot have a Home record like Denver has, without extenuating  causes and reasons... Which reasons is altitude on traveling teams, especially on back to back.
Clipper Nation Stand Up::Denver fans be puffing out their chests.  Cute.
LifeInInfrared::Any finals with Heat, Knicks, OKC, Clippers, or Nuggets would be fun to watch.
Izaman5000::Clippers Heat is what i want to see.

SupremeKobe::Western Conference will have exciting games!!! Cannot tell who will win????????  http://AllTimeNBA.com/
SupremeKobe::yeap
Izaman5000::Western conference will have 4 great series, East, only NY Boston.
SupremeKobe::LifeInInfrared - Indiana - Chicago would be interesting.  OKC - Houston too, hopefully!
Izaman5000::Would be, but with the Hawks throwing tonights game, its Chicago Brooklyn.
LifeInInfrared::Indiana - Chicago would be interesting.
Tim R. Tebow::Exciting?  :)
Chinga a tu madre::lakers should sign iverson
mike dantoni running teams into the ground since 2008::jimmy buss will just as soon as he finishes the line he's on
mike dantoni running teams into the ground since 2008::knicks have apparently just copied miami's 2011-2012 formula
Gobi Sith::I like Stotts, seems like a really good guy -- I think it's time Stotts gets fired.  Bye
mike dantoni running teams into the ground since 2008::guy seems like garbage crap plays
Soonerhopeful1::Adios  Clippers fans, enjoyed it...  Almost didn't recognize the board without our Lakers friends telling us how bad we are and much better are Lakers...!      I guess the dye is caste, and Lakers can only be 8th seed with a win facing the #1 Thunder...Mm  fun fun for Lakers.  ha ha...!

FadeBackShootBrickAgainMan::that's what I think
Izaman5000::Knicks BETTER win game 1.
LifeInInfrared::What team do you think will win?
FadeBackShootBrickAgainMan::that's true but I think they won't survive long without rondo
LifeInInfrared::Ehh, you never know.
FadeBackShootBrickAgainMan::lol you shouldn't be..I think the celtics are done
LifeInInfrared::Yeah, as a Knicks fan I'm pretty nervous about the Celtics. Two hall of famers on their team won't be easy.
FadeBackShootBrickAgainMan::knicks winnin but it won't be a sweep
Knicks Your 2013 Champs Knicks::knicks in 4 fool
FadeBackShootBrickAgainMan::doubt it
darbydurb::Don't like the nuggets clippers scenario, nuggets play in the division with the best team in their conference. Have beaten Clippers head to head and might have to face the best team in the league second round (would have to loose to suns) Same ish happened when Dallas was the third best team in the league and had to play San Antonio best team in the league second round.
darbydurb::My teams been out the playoffs for months so that has nothing to do with it, just wanna see the best teams play on the bigger stage.
darbydurb::Not months but it feels like it
darbydurb::It's easily fixable that's what bugs me. Football is different just on the basis of how many teams get in.
Izaman5000::I think the nba should just have 12 team playoff like the nfl.  and the best 4 teams should have byes.
darbydurb::They could reseed like hockey, or just keep it the same that division winners are never lower than 4 and if there is a team with more wins then them they have a higher seed or tied it goes to head to head.
Izaman5000::True, but its similar to home court in the first round as an advantage.  I think your beef is that they dont reseed in the 2nd round....
Izaman5000::Its the same as football.  Can complain about being in the Pats' division...
Izaman5000::Denver:  Remaining Games: vs. Phoenix Suns (Wednesday)  In order to hold secure the No. 3 seed, the Nuggets simply have to beat the lowly 25-56 Suns on Wednesday.  ...If the Suns find a way to pull off the upset, however, and the Los Angeles Clippers win their last two games, the Clips and Nuggs would switch places.  Denver won the season series, but Los Angeles' division title would trump that in the event of a tie.
LifeInInfrared::Really? Didn't know division title was favored over a tiebreaker. Thank you.
LifeInInfrared::Ahhh, ok. I see.
Factoids R Us::Two-Team Tiebreaker:  1.Division winner (this criterion is applied regardless of whether the tied teams are in the same division)  2.Better record in head-to-head games  3.Higher winning percentage within division (if teams are in the same division)  4.Higher winning percentage in conference games  5.Higher winning percentage against playoff teams in own conference (including tied teams)  6.Higher winning percentage against playoff teams in opposite conference (including tied teams)

NBA Announcer::The ESPN headline says "Clippers clinch the 4 seed". Is that true? I thought if Denver loses tomorrow and clips win, they would be the 3?
LifeInInfrared::Denver owns the tiebreaker so no.
Izaman5000::in this case, 4th seed doesnt mean home court first round.
Knicks Your 2013 Champs Knicks::probabiliyy of me getting laid with kate upton is higher than boston beating knicks

Factoids R Us::Denver 3 seed   Clips 4 seed Memphis 5 seed (but homecourt over LAC in Rd 1)
darbydurb::Denver is already the three seed, no matter what.
Factoids R Us::its a moot point, Suns are not beating Denver in Denver....and I agree with ya on the Head to Head :)
darbydurb::That's garbage thou, should come down to head to head. and the division winner cannot drop below 4 still.
darbydurb::Yeah your right, ok if the suns win lol
Factoids R Us::Two-Team Tiebreaker:  1.Division winner (this criterion is applied regardless of whether the tied teams are in the same division)  2.Better record in head-to-head games  3.Higher winning percentage within division (if teams are in the same division)  4.Higher winning percentage in conference games  5.Higher winning percentage against playoff teams in own conference (including tied teams)  6.Higher winning percentage against playoff teams in opposite conference (including tied teams)

Factoids R Us::1st tiebreaker is Div Winner 2nd Tiebreak is Head to HEad  Clippers are the 3 seed with a tied record
darbydurb::No Denver cannot end with a record worse than the clippers and have the season series, they are the 3 seed.
Factoids R Us::no Clippers can get the 3 if Denver loses and Clippers win
Izaman5000::Thats not what the link on the right side of this page says.
