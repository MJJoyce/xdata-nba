RHL6788::I am prdicting a clean sweep for Dallas VS Cleveland this weekend.Mavs win &amp; Cowboys today!!
KentuckyAlum2012::Cleveland fans were talking playoffs when they started 2-2. Now they have a worse record than the Bobcats lol. If they don't surround Irving with some better players, I can see him leaving once his rookie contract ends. With their defense being the worst in the NBA, and a lack of talent, this looks like another lottery team.
numberounofightingirish::I started playing an online bet system called Sportsbettingstar. Since I started I have made an average profit of $3,000 a month. I hope that this reaches someone that is looking for an online betting system that really works well. I found this system on the 1st page of Google by searching the  words Sports Betting System.  I strongly encourage you to check this out if you bet at all.
Uhggly::love that Waiters shot percentage creep lower and lower each game.. Fatboy can't shoot
allwedoiswingames::we need phil jackson
YenxRenx::Don't forget, I told you so---HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
These young bloods dont practice the fundentals::Where is the defense Cavs, every team is scoring over 100 points on them and shooting over 50%
I3UTTON::When Lebron left, the defense went with him
Drun2400::Kyrie needs some help down there in Cleveland.
Whitemamba-Celia Cruz Pick and Roll::Kyrie did graduate from duke. he took summer classes bc his dad wanted him to get a degree. Get ur facts str8 and irving is shooting close to 50% frm the field even while avging 24ppg which is insane for a pg. He has to carry the scoring load bc no1 else can create their own shot.
- Thomas Chmura -::The Cavs do have talent,. future talent that is. In a couple of years, we'll have a core of Kyrie, Waiters,TT, Tyler Zeller, Lottery Player X (from this years draft), Alonzo Gee as our defensive stopper, and Andy coming off the bench. The future is bright!
sduke1986::You're quite misinformed my friend.  Sure, Kyrie's stats were not great in this game, but he is being told to to take the load for this team.  He averages over 5 assists a game and if the talent is not around him, then what is he suppose to do?  These guys are not talented enough to create their own shot and often times not talented enough to make them when Irving dishes it to them, thus Kyrie must take shots to make up for them.  How is what he does any different from Derek Rose?  Yet you hear no one complaining about Rose.  Would you like to know why?  Because Rose has TALENT around him.  If you would have paid attention so far this year, you would see Irving makes those around him better.  Look at the game Anderson had the other day.  Give them some time and some more good draft picks and you will change your tune.
YenxRenx::Kyrie the ballhog is the problem. Foolish Cavs fans think its great that Irving scores a bunchh of points. They forget that good basketball teams spread their offense around rather than just feeding the same guy over and over. Opposing teams are happy to allow the Cavs to run their one-man offense because they know the Cavs are easily beaten when they do.  Kyrie Iriving = a selfish .300 player who lacks any understanding of how to run a team offense. Generally those lessons are learned in college, but Kyrie dropped out of college. Look forward to more failure from Kyrie the Bust!!! lol
JD92111::Hahaha the jets and yankees. Bwahahahahaha.
Brandon18502::You mean up?
TheBrownestBob::Luke Walton - DNP CJ Miles - DNP  All in all, a successful evening for the Cavs.
YenxRenx::To Cleveland fans "success' is any loss by less than 20 points. Too funny!!
JD92111::Hahaha Jets and Yankees!!!!!
Awesome Hasaface The Retrial::How can a loss be successful ?
LOUDaboutmy_YANKS_HEAT_PATS_DUKIES_KNICKS_CUSE::I3UTTON - because Melo and Amare don't play well together. The Knicks have a better record without Amare this season and last.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  PROVE THAT WHEN AMARE IS IN WE DO WORSE!
--LeTs gO MaVS--::Knicks are going to get worse when Amare gets back. Melo and Amare can't play ball together. Anyways can you leave cause Mavs fans really don't care about the Knicks
I3UTTON::Knick fans just make themselves look dumber and dumber by the second lol
I3UTTON::and obviously the Knicks are 6-1 without him this season.
I3UTTON::check this article from last season: http://sports.yahoo.com/news/fan-york-knicks-better-off-without-amare-stoudemire-184200378--nba.html  here's an excerpt from the article:   "When Stoudemire was in the lineup this season, the Knicks went 22-25 (.468 winning percentage) and averaged 1.6 more points than their opponents. When he missed games due to injuries, the Knicks went 14-5 (.737 winning percentage) and had a point differential of +7.2 points per game. The team averaged more points on offense and gave up fewer points on defense during those 19 games without him, posting an obscenely good record in the process."
Nowitzki.::East teams will prove that in the playoffs.Why should Mavs fans care about that?
LOUDaboutmy_YANKS_HEAT_PATS_DUKIES_KNICKS_CUSE::CAUSE YOU SAID THAT WERE WORSE.  NO WAY THAT AMARE'S BACKUP IS BETTER THAN HIM!
Nowitzki.::This happens with every fanbase after a long time of mediocrity.Some people who have no idea about basketball suddenly see their team win some games and start bashing other teams.Look at the Wolves fans last year.They have less trolls this season.Same will happen with the Knicks.Bandwagoners will either leave and get some better bball education.
pico2013::Good Riddance Linsanity Welcome BACK VINSANITYYYYYYYYYYYY GIVE ME A HELL YEAAH
I3UTTON::a Knick fan recently tried to argue with me that Carmelo is better than Dirk. I kindly reminded him of what Dirk did in the 2011 postseason and what Carmelo has never done in the postseason.   His response: "Dirk only won that title because he had TYSON!"  My response: "Um, Tyson played with Melo last season too, how far did the Knicks go in the postseason??" He had no response hahaha  The moral of the story: Knick fans are dumb
pico2013::you are stupid ma friend. Dirk didnt win it just because he had tyson, he had a complete team that believed they can win it all. props to jason terry and kidd too.
LOUDaboutmy_YANKS_HEAT_PATS_DUKIES_KNICKS_CUSE::THAN HOW DID WE BEAT YOU!?
Nowitzki.::???
JBAGS1965::How does a point guard have 0 assists?
ricky2213::because when he passed it to people for a shot they are garbage and cant make it
--LeTs gO MaVS--::No mavs fans care about the Knicks. Why do these same Knick fans come to Mavs boards all the time? great you beat us. Now move along
I3UTTON::Knick fans are just butthurt because they don't know what it's like to be relevant in the postseason :)

seansean145::That guy has an odd mix of teams he cheers for.....LMFAO.
I3UTTON::lol that's funny because Knick fans talk all the time about how they're much better WITHOUT Amare!
I3UTTON::because Melo and Amare don't play well together. The Knicks have a better record without Amare this season and last.
LOUDaboutmy_YANKS_HEAT_PATS_DUKIES_KNICKS_CUSE::HOW!?
hokienation135::Kyrie needs more help
yata-9arasu::37% shooting as a team and he missed a part of the game...

Fan of Underdogs 2012::Nice to see O.J. Mayo having a good season.  This might finally be the year he has his big breakthrough and makes the all-star game.  Good for him if that happens.
yata-9arasu::These posters have no clue how to build a team.  They think they can just struggle one year after losing the best player in the NBA, losing their entire roster and draft a 18 year old and win 41+ games.  You guys are delusional.  Sam keeps bringing up the Cavs record under Scott which has been bad but what can you expect from a team that has no depth and almost all their roster under 22 years of age.  43-113 with Durant in their first two years.  I bet everyone was saying "Oh, Durant is just numbers but no results" seeing as they never won more than 23 games in his first two year.  Well guess what...  The Cavs won 22/23 games in their first year with Irving(shortened year).  If this team doesn't start winning when they have more talent I will put the blame on Scott(within the next two years).  It is a process.  Not every team can sign 5-6 FA and become a contender over night.

-FlyEaglesFly-::its unacceptable that Kyrie didnt have one single assist in this game. if he wants this team to get any better he needs to set up his teammates
-FlyEaglesFly-::who cares how many he had before? not many as far as I know, but thats not the point. you cant have games with zero assist if you want to be an elite PG
-FlyEaglesFly-::hope it was the last time. i understand that the team is not good enought. thats why he needs to help them all. some pick and rolls with andy, some open shots for waiters. he has to create something for them. he has some options out there
yata-9arasu::6 a game.  The Cavs shot 35%.  He was hurt a while.  It happens to everyone.
yata-9arasu::How many assists did he have going into this game?
Kobe6timechampion::Dude...
yata-9arasu::I was talking to the person above you.
Kobe6timechampion::Whoa.  You follow me everywhere bro.
Kobe6timechampion::Yes and at least ONE rebound.  But his teammates suck and cannot create their own shot.  He was shooting over 50% for the game with over 20 shots.  Pretty efficient.
mavericksfan4life256::kamn &gt; dumbwood mayo &gt; terry collison &gt; kidd
Kobe6timechampion::OJ Mayo MVP of Tonight's Game.  The Kobe ball hog award goes to Kyrie.
Justinkm83::I actually think Kaman was the MVP. He had 6 blocks, 15 pts, and 8 reb.
yata-9arasu::How many assists did he average this year?
Kobe6timechampion::I'm kidding.  Relax.  You're like that dude that follow the hobbit around everywhere.
Justinkm83::Dahntay Jones was a difference maker tonight.
I3UTTON::Btw Collison's assist/turnover ratio was MUCH better than Dojo's tonight (4:1 for Collison and only 1.7:1 for Dojo)
CakeEsco::DoJo was a big help tonight as well.
I3UTTON::defense is nice to have, but not all good point guards play good D. Look at Steve Nash for example, arguably one of the top 5 PG's in the game, yet a very poor defender.
I3UTTON::when comparing 2 point guards, yes rebounds are irrelevant for that particular argument. Just look at the career numbers as well, Collison averages 12 points and 5 and half assists for his career, Dojo averages about 3 points and 2 or 3 assists for his career. Collison has proven himself in the NBA, Dojo hasn't, that's the bottom line.
CakeEsco::I3UTTON - Rebounds are irrelevant at the point guard position. Collison averages 14 points and 6 and a half assists on the season. If you really think Dojo is better than Collison than idk what to say to you man lol.... that is just laughable  Rebounds are never irrelevant. I didn't say he was better but they're not far apart. It doesn't matter how much you score if you give it right back up on D like Collison does night after night.
I3UTTON::Rebounds are irrelevant at the point guard position. Collison averages 14 points and 6 and a half assists on the season. If you really think Dojo is better than Collison than idk what to say to you man lol.... that is just laughable
CakeEsco::I3UTTON - Collison played 31 minutes tonight and had only 2 turnovers. Dojo played only 18 minutes and had 3 turnovers. Collison also had 14 points and 8 assists tonight.  So I'm sorry but comparing Dojo to Collison is just rediculous lol  DoJo had more rebounds and steals than Collison. DoJo - 4 rebounds, 2 steals. Collison - 2 rebounds, 1 steal. DoJo also had 5 assists (only 3 less than Collison in half the playing time) and 10 points
I3UTTON::Collison played 31 minutes tonight and had only 2 turnovers. Dojo played only 18 minutes and had 3 turnovers. Collison also had 14 points and 8 assists tonight.  I'm sorry but comparing Dojo to Collison is just rediculous lol
CakeEsco::I3UTTON - lol no Collison is MUCH better than Dojo  He usually makes as many careless turnovers as DoJo and he isn't nearly as good on D.
I3UTTON::lol no Collison is MUCH better than Dojo
Justinkm83::Dojo missed quite a few from 5 ft or less, but is better against the bigger guards.
CakeEsco::I3UTTON - he looked good at times, yet made some very careless turnovers at other times...still don't trust him quite yet  I say the same thing about Collison every game.
CakeEsco::Justinkm83 - Yeah he was. If only he could shoot.  If he keeps driving to the basket like he has been I'll forgive his jump shooting abilities being sub par.
I3UTTON::he looked good at times, yet made some very careless turnovers at other times...still don't trust him quite yet
Justinkm83::Yeah he was. If he could only shoot..
.Cutty::Kemba is better than Kyrie
Kobe6timechampion::Kemba sucks.
Justinkm83::No he's not. From a Mavs fan
Justinkm83::I'll take any W without Dirk at this point.
I3UTTON::especially on the road, on the 2nd of a back to back
CakeEsco::I don't predict seeing any hate for Murphy tonight after he knocked down those big threes to keep us up in the fourth.
CakeEsco::Not sure, but we won so I won't question the decision.
Justinkm83::Yeah, but why was he taken out after the 3rd one?
zachzach2020::Who thinks that Dan Gilbert even cares about putting a championship type team on the floor. Or is he just happy having ONE exciting player that the fans will pay to watch?
