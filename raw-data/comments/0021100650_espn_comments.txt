Linfanticide::no MIN. without rubio. love killed us down the stretch with threes.
Meet-The-Forkers::Pistons=shameful to David Stern.

DetKoolAid::pistons = 5th most wins and championships in nba history also just finished a stretch of 8 good years. every team rebuilds
whydavid::Just finished?  The team has sucked for 5 years straight...how long is this rebuilding going to last?
DetKoolAid::its cool i know wins that mean something mean nothing in phoenix...as a sports state you have nothing to really be proud about but its cool you support your team we support ours
Meet-The-Forkers::yawn, burp and fart.

trademarktaz::The Suns are pretty much the only good sports team in the whole state of Arizona right now so this must be front page news for them.
trademarktaz::Enjoy your menial success, Suns fans. We need draft picks anyway. Enjoy building around Channing Frye and Shannon Brown
Meet-The-Forkers::We admit it this is one of the worst records in history.  Scoreboard.
ZonaRado::Yeah, SCOREBOARD mofo
whydavid::Yeah the Diamondbacks didn't make the playoffs last year or anything.
whydavid::You did catch the sarcasm...right?
Meet-The-Forkers::yes we did.
PhxSunsOwn13::Dbacks.....
PhxSunsOwn13::Spring Training you idiot.. They also have 5 NL West championships, 1 world series all in under 14 years of being a franchise.
whydavid::They also posted one of the worst spring training records in baseball last year, because Gibson works them like dogs.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::preseason... who cares
Meet-The-Forkers::Dbacks for sure!
Linfanticide::Dbacks just went 24 straight innings the other day without scoring a run.
littlebabylalash::The Suns getting excited because they are struggling to beat a 16-27 at home who for some reason arent playing their best player.....  And they think they are  a playoff team
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::Pistons are playing pretty good hey
ZonaRado::You're so smart...
