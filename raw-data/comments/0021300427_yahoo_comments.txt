PKM::Durant doing everything might just work out.
MARK FREDRIC::Charlotte with the comeback! Send it to overtime!
Michael Williams::Lets go Bobcats if we rebound and play defense like we can and have been we can win. Big Al and Kemba are going to show up but we will need nice contributions from Sessions, Zeller, and Henderson to pull it out.
PKM::Thunder are a juggernaut.
cool_me::Jackson stop taking jumpshots if you can't shoot it. Just drive to the basket or pass it.
chuck d::Hard to believe Perkins starts and makes the kind of coin he is making.
J::All Blazers fans are rooting for Charlotte like me.  Don't Judge me!
Dave H::To many outside shots! take the ball to the hoop, put the ball on the floor and drive it in!
Guest::Ok KD, you went from 22% to 40% in one quarter. Whatcha gonna do the next 2?
chuck d::Perkins only 29 moves like he is 100.4th highest paid on Thunder, hard to believe he even starts.
