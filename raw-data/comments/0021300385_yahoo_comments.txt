Yao::It wasn't pretty but … we'll take it. We need to get more out of Bynums limited minutes. Hopefully Waiters will be able to play tomorrow and we can get a W in Chicago.
Peter::Hey Lady Jean, at least spell your boyfriend's last name correctly. He really got those 30 and 10 tonight didn't he?
gdp::That's odd but they don't even talk about Kyrie's 4 blocked shots too! Not a Cleveland fan, but this kids' fun to watch and a superstar in the making
Thomas::The question is if the lazy sleepwalking 10 point first quarter Cavs show up or the Champs to be show up.  Let expect that the Cavs win by at least 10 or more and keep playing at the high level we have seen lately.   If possible they should blow these guys out and send a message to the league. "Here we come."
ROBERT::WHy is Henson on the bench in OT... smh
delbert::knight and mayo shoot a combined 12-41. damn thats rough lol...
James Reynaldo::Wow what a game by Knight except the shooting percentage
Rebecca Black::Anthony Bennett didn't even play...apparently he's watching college videos of himself (see his Yahoo! profile). Wow!
- LJ::believe me!!! super rookie top overall pick the real deal future mvp and the second greatest of alltime next only to MJ anthony the beast bennet will drop 30 and 10 in this game....
Michael::Glad we took Anthony Bennett over Oladipo and McLemore, nothing stupid about that.....
