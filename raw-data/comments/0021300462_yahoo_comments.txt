Alvordton::I know Orlando is not a very good team right now but when you can win big on the road without your best scorer getting to double figures, you are doing some things right.
PKM::Warriors are just a game behind the Clippers now.
David::Another good game by the Warriors. Not everything went right; but they are starting to play more and more like a TEAM. It is showing in the stats. Congratulations to Kent Bazemore. He had some good shots and plays. He is looking better without the Hip-Hop. However, he has a lot farther to go both individually and as a team player. The good news is that he seems to have the talent to be a really good player eventually.
I am U::As a Magic Fan, I think we need to concentrate on Jabari Parker or Wiggins.
Nathan::The end of 3rd Quarter by Thompson is just terrible. Too lazy !! Anyone can jack up a 30 foot 3pointer.
Nathan::Still way too many TOs !! That's what they need to work on every game !!
Salad::Anyone know why Vucevic has only played 8 minutes??
Anton::Turkoglu is still a Magic ? o.0
I am U::Sould he Magic Tank the rest of the season? In my opinion: YES!!!!!
dster20::Ten turnovers from their starting back court. Too many. Other than that a decent effort. Good win.
