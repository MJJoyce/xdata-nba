erikdog23::Lmao that dance Curry did at the end.
nba is the worst::Quite a 4th Q, despite the massive ref help for the clippers - always nice to see 5 beat 8!
davxav::I never get tired of the Steph Curry story.  May the ankle never give out. . .
jeff050578::I think J. Jack should be a frontrunner for 6th man of the year. He doesnt have the ppg some other 6th men have but the way he runs the floor and helps settle the young Dubs team down is very important.
SB4LlFE::Why do the Clippers always complain and whine about other team's celebrations after they lose?? Bunch of sourpusses
Team Oceanic815::Dont the Clippers do the same thing to other teams! Jumping up and down like animals on the bench n on the court.
BigNick35::Crawford did
nba is the worst::Who complained?
mkwan0::The clippers are as good a team as there is right now.  The question is, can they translate to the post season.  They didn't last year.  Are they one year more seasoned and one year hungrier?  SA and OKC are waiting to test them.
TheWalkingDead92::Unless Golden state get the 7th or 8th seed i don't see them playing the Clippers. Fact that nobody takes the clippers for real when they can literally match up with anyone is a joke. Btw why was crawford guarding curry in the 4th. Bledsoe should of been doing that..
Dubberhm::Scary for the Clippers... I can still remember the Dallas vs Golden State. The Dallas were the no. 1 team that time but they were beaten in the First Round by the no 8 seed Warriors c/o Stephen Jackson and Baron Davis... Anything goes in the playoff... Last year many pick SA to win against OKC and OKC against the Heat. Don't count out any team yet, whether its the GS or the Clips or even the Houston...
DLee4MVP07::Golden State IS for real!! So much fun to watch!
HH69::I can't wait until the Warriors get some depth and a good center (I'm not relying on Bogut).
BlazersFan900::can't wait for blake to blow out his knee
MR0908::If these teams meet in the playoffs warriors win in 4 or 5. Especially with Bogut back.
Oaktown_As25::Which is the reason why the Warriors are up 3-1 in the season series...?
CarlyJoni::Clips will have home court.  Home court will win.
NoThanks2u_18::LAC might be the 'best' WC team now. But come playoff time I don't see them going far. I see OKC, GS, MEM and SA/HOU being the top 4. LAC just don't seem like a playoff threat
wavetoyou::They amassed their amazing record via the 17game winning streak...most of those teams they faced were under .500
nurein::I always laugh when players complain about their opponent celebrating their win or just a basket, get over it if you can't take it go home!
64801Mike::I have been betting with a system named SportsBettingStar for  only two months and have profitted about 3K each month just following its tips. You can find the system on the first page of Google by searching for sports betting systems. If you bet on sports at all you gotta see this.
SFGOLD07::Venturing into the realm of being a Warriors fan. Man fk the Maloofs and therefore the Kings. I cant root for anything Seattle.  So lets go Warriors ! Burning my Kings gear day after the move
DoubleV1369::welcome! get on the bandwagon now, before anyone is aware that they are this good lol
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::cool :)
bsktblfan23::Crazy stuff from Steph Curry....45.5% from 3 pt this season! As a Davidson fan and Bobcats fan (yes i know) i miss watching this kid
wavetoyou::As a Bobcats fan, you won't have to miss it for long. Steph truly enjoys coming to Carolina each season and lighting you guys up in front of his hometown, friends, and family...especially daddy Dell ;)
NetsMagazine8::CATS FAN?
WarriorsWarrior::Chris played with a limp... blah blah so if he had not played  they would have been trounced?  and curry and lee were  healthy right?
Carbon-based::Cp3 going to the knicks
-Td4mvp3 -::Dont look now...but here come the spurs bout to retake the #1 spot out west! ;)
Carbon-based::Maybe cp3 should have sat out the game again
fanunknown::was that  cliff or chris paul that played tonight?
TheCAVega::Stephen Curry Jordan
15knick15::Kobe Bryant's 2K13 Xbox controller:     A: Shoot   B: Shoot   Y: Shoot   X: Shoot   RB: Turnover   LB: Call for pass   A + LT: Fire Coach  B + RT: Blame teammate
DoubleV1369::clicking the Right Stick in will get you the patented Kobe Sneer
KnowYourRo11::Don't forget....pause button: Death Stare
dash2k4::Reminds me of Sonics-Denver. Or GS-Dallas. Clippers are a great team this year that can't get over GS. This is a bad playoffs matchup for LAC if it comes to that.
cballou18::CarlyJoni keep grasping for straws. Warriors were on a back to back also that day so quit making excuses
DoubleV1369::Warriors are 3-1 they won the first game in LA
PeanutJuiceCorn::what are you talking about? warriors first win against the clippers was at la
CarlyJoni::That was so early in the season (and a back to back after a win against the Lakers), could almost count as a preseason game.  Clips will win the Pacific Division and have home court against the Dubs.  Home court wins.
KnowYourRo11::That may be true but the way the season is going so far, Clippers could have home court advantage if they play GSW. W's wins were on their court. Clips wins were on theirs. 4-3 Clippers in a 7 game series.
-Td4mvp3 -::WOOOOEEEEE SPURS!!!!!!!!!!!
-Td4mvp3 -::Dont look now...but here come the spurs bout to retake the #1 spot out west! ;)
stairwell13::Chris Paul had 4 points, gave up 28 to stephen curry, and there are actually sportswriters that have him as their leading MVP candidate?  BAHAHAHAHAHA
Owen Freeman verona::he was hurt
wavetoyou::This one was ours! Last game, when the Clippers blew us out, CP3 couldn't miss. He ended up going like 11 for 14. Good lord that was tough to watch. But tonight was Steph's turn to prove why he deserves to be an All-Star, along with Lee
Jeffharwell::Curry just sprained his ankle for the 400th time...lee is hobbled too...Do not make excuses. Curry has the clippers number
heatonomics::Didn't see the game either, but you need to blame the coach for letting him play with a limp. If you get on the hardwood, then you are ready to play...no excuses.
KnowYourRo11::stoop...apparently he doesn't watch any games. Just reads the box scores.
stoop404::he played the entire game with a limp. did you not watch the game?
BootyLoaf::only 4 points for cp3? ouch
CarlyJoni::Good game for the Clips.  Yeah, they lost on the road but kept up with the Dubs till the end.  Good test for the playoffs, where the intensity factor will carry the Clips on the road.  Got to save the energy for OKC tomorrow.  Home win streak at stake.
heatonomics::The outcome is going to depend on how many free throws KD and Westbrook get.
KnowYourRo11::Streak ended already. Get over it and tonight's game. Move on to tomorrow's game against OKC. Possibly CP3 might not play to recover bruised knee. Rest of team has to step up. Clippers will have chip on their shoulder. Going to take it out on Thunder. Should be a crazy game.
FriscoWarriors415::Didn't that streak already end to the magic?
BayAreaSportsFan16::bring on okc!
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::gasol is gonna get traded
varsityvideogamer::David Lee or Tim Duncan should've made the All Star starting lineup instead of Dwight. They did better. Steph should definitely make it as a reserve. And Garnett? What about Tyson Chandler? Kobe, I have mixed feelings about his selection, because the Lakers are sucking. I think random people are voting who don't watch NBA that much, and are voting for the name which was good last year or the year before, not this year. And Warriors players will never get voted, because they used to be a joke, and those random fans are just dismissing Dubs players. Remember Jamison a few years ago? Yeah, coaches really need to get a vote, and count for 65%-70% of the votes, too, because coaches are very knowledgeable. Can you believe Bynum got 80,000+ votes?
varsityvideogamer::Meaning coaches get a vote at starting lineups.
StanfordOtter 6.0::In all honesty Anderson Varejao should have been the starting center for the East, but now he's out.
varsityvideogamer::Better than Garnett was doing
varsityvideogamer::Yeah. He was having a career year.
No-account drifter::Liking those Dubs more and more.
varsityvideogamer::Yes, they've really turned things around.
varsityvideogamer::you too? look below
varsityvideogamer::The username of the other guy is 4 Petes Sake
brandonstephensy::Westbrook will own CP3 .... CP3's stats always falls down when they play the thunder
KnowYourRo11::What was the series last season between OKC and Clippers?
varsityvideogamer::Maybe, but Westbrook can make crappy decisions sometimes.
Boltman021::Oddly enough they play better against the Thunder however
varsityvideogamer::really? This isn't YouTube you know?
SB4LlFE::clippers must be more mad after the W's celebrated their win ("like winning a championship" - cp3)
WarriorsWarrior::Reminds me of the giants versus Padres 2010
Boltman021::Ouch bro. Low blow.
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::Mat Latos' two biggest career starts both spoiled by the Giants ;) ;) ;)
ItsAllComingBackToMe1985::Ive been following a betting system called SportsBettingStar the last couple months now.  Im making around 3K per month just by following the system.
Mesmartoday::Sounds great! I like money!
WarriorsWarrior::Chris Paul is clutch I've seen it too many times
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::they should have just stuck with bledsoe, probably had a better chance
WarriorsWarrior::Sorry I didn't see the game I'll let you know tomorrow I have it TAPED LOL
brandonstephensy::Westbrook &gt; CP3
clippersck::I think you mean westbrick
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::why do westbrook and durant curl up when they play lebron
varsityvideogamer::Durant is clutch, but I don't think Westbrook is good under pressure.
lukesabin::Just no.
Oaktown1029::Curry comes around those screens so nicely, he's got such a quick release it's hard to block his shot.
KnowYourRo11::I hate to say it but I agree. Just like Reggie but not as ugly. LOL
brandonstephensy::OKC coming from a close game loss against Denver, Clippers from GS.. it will be a heated battle..
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::If the clippers want a piece of the pie so bad, fine, here's one that GSW fans will be glad to admit :     Griffin played better than Lee tonight. Happy? :-P
WarriorsWarrior::Luke are you saying the reason why the clippers lost today is because Chris Paul was hurt? Why have they lost the last two of 3 times?
Oaktown1029::what's up warrior?
Oaktown1029::nice afternoon game today - it seems we always played the T-Wolves before on MLK day - nice win.
WarriorsWarrior::Work bro you?
OAKadam::Honestly I don't see a need for animosity between these fanbases. Both of our teams are cellar-dwellers historically and now they're kickin' @$$ and takin' names. We should all be able to unite in our hatred for the Lakers and bask in the glory of the Dubs and the Clip show owning the Pacific
clippersck::Don't get ahead of yourself there but I will say the warriors got a lot of talent no doubt
varsityvideogamer::Yes, the Warriors are lacking at center. Will likely build through draft and/or free agency, cause they don't have trade bait, unless they want to trade Jack but that's unlikely unless they're getting a good C.
OAKadam::And again, they're missing their most legit big man. Festus and Andris can get it done on the glass and defensive end, but Bogut doesn't have butter fingers like they do and he's got a good eye for passing
clippersck::And the warriors are a definite first round exit the clips on the other hand will prob make west conf finals
varsityvideogamer::Clips can fall to 4th behind OKC, Spurs, and Grizzlies if the Griz can make a run. But probably it'll be 1. Thunder 2. Spurs 3. Clippers 4. Warriors 5. Grizzlies  But Warriors will get to the 2nd round unless they choke like the Sharks.
varsityvideogamer::Bogut can get injured again................ But he will be a playoff presence, no doubt.
OAKadam::I'm expecting Bogut is going to be back by then and he's only going to make them a stronger playoff presence. I think they've got a great chance to beat any of the teams they'd face, besides maybe OKC. And I don't see them falling to 7th or 8th seed
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::just hope u dont get the dubs in the first round, clipps will be done!
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::Atleast we have championships, clips never even sniffed the finals
OAKadam::Yeah, but that was in 1975. Over a decade before I was born
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::Clippers are just glad they dont have to play the Dubs no more, now they have a chance at keeping up with OKC
schalich11::warriors are 3-1 against the clippers
varsityvideogamer::I think they've only played 3 times, but I could be wrong.
lukesabin::Why is everyone bagging on the Clippers? They still have a better record than every other team besides OKC. Chris Paul was hobbling the whole night too.
WarriorsWarrior::Because they're good team but they're one and three against the Warriors and if you want to talk about hurt try David Lee and Steph Curry both have ankle problems too
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::he still made his shots though
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::he said before the game he knew his ankle was definitely not 100%
lukesabin::Did you see Steph Curry hobbling tonight? I don't think so.
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::mostly laker and okc fans. not really gsw fans
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::ah excuses, thats why cp3 wouldnt be a warrior, we are a, "NO EXCUSE BASKETBALL TEAM"
jumpy785::Is anybody know this the Warriors points are pattern: 33 20 20 33
OAKadam::You do English good
jumpy785::thanks
WarriorsWarrior::Mark Jackson is a great leader but Michael Malone is a very good coach!
