yeahgodisgood2me::I found a betting system a few months back called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I discovered this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for anyone that is looking for a system that actually works. There is a reason this system is all over Google as highly rated, it works

Taco with a Q::Nice to see classy fans for both teams here!  This is a message board I always wish I could see!  As a Pacers fan I love us fans staying classy and staying knowledgable for the sport and our team!
i liked this comment::CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WAS VAREJO IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT? HIS INJURY HAS TAKEN LONGER TO HEAL THAN THOSE WHO ARE IN A COMA????WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Coy McColt::They're letting varajao completely heal from his injuries for next season, if these games meant a chance for the playoffs he'd probably be on the court instead of on the injuried list.
goldtedz::saving him and Kylie til next year... wont be long til Jamison need a lil "break" time too.
JohnsonnnL::Espn didn't even show highlights for this game.
The Lakers are good at basketball::ESPN doesn't like good teams only dramatic ones
i liked this comment::WHATS ESPN?
iownamicrowave::espn sucks
Hands Off Hobo Joe::People love to attack Cleveland because they see a fan base that sticks by their team through ups and downs. It reminds them of their own bandwagoning and front-running. They can't stand it.

DaBostonStrangler10::Alex is right. http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2011
ceburch151::serious, 3rd? and just cause they lose doesn't mean they don't deserve teams, from a Kansas City fan
Alex818728::same reason the Cavs were 3rd in the NBA in attendance last year, loyal fans
baja00::Read my reaction to the game <a href="http://bit.ly/IvcPrw">Here</a> as well as <a href="http://bit.ly/IIAuGJ">Ranking the Top 10 Pacers</a>. Comment, Criticize, and tell me what you think!

aabalas::Cavs almost blew it and won tonight.
aabalas::Yes, they have alot of fight in them.  Guys are playing to keep their jobs as well.
BigHandsomeHoosier::The Cavs wanted it more than the Pacers tonight.  They would've gotten the Pacers had Irving been healthy.  Things are looking up out there.
baja00::you gotta like Byron Scott going forward tho. Your fans are great too!
BigHandsomeHoosier::Pacers clinch a playoff berth with a win over the Cavs Friday.  Gotta love it!
baja00::Just like Buzz's girlfriend, that game was "Woof"!
BigHandsomeHoosier::Yup
screwhead2305::indy trade Collison
StudBrackman::I come here to read Luke Walton stat lines
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Peace guys! Read the article I posted below haha!
letsgobucks-osu::The Cavs are the only team in Cleveland that I believe in. It's really sad when I have to say a 19-37 team is the only team that has a shot.
Poorguta::at least the browns have a real front office now, that's more than the bengals can say
letsgobucks-osu::Yeah, I guess, but I kinda lost respect for them after they traded away our fifth pick in the draft last season, the only good thing about having a bad season is having a good draft pick and they ruined that for us.
letsgobucks-osu::No sports fans deserve these teams. I really hope we don't have to put up with these awful teams much longer, but I have a feeling like we will.
Alex818728::i agree
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::http://bleacherreport.com/articles/422329-mws-top-10-cities-with-the-unluckiest-fans
KingGeorge53::This has been fun tonight, but this old man has to hit the sack.  C all you Pacer/Cav fans back here real soon.  Pacers = 2012 cinderella team in the playoffs. Cavaliers = cr.ap team on the rise.
Alex818728::Hope Milwakee pulls it off verse the knicks
SRStark20::I saw a thing on ESPN that listed the top five unluckiest sports cities, and Cleveland wasn't even mentioned.  I remember Atlanta being #1 and Seattle being #2  Somebody texted a thing in to sports nation and said 'Damn, Cleveland can't even win a "worst sports city" award.'
DyersEve06::Braves got their only freaking World Series title against the Indians.
letsgobucks-osu::At least they won it recently, not in 1948.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::I didn't mention the Braves lol. I mentioned their basketball and former hockey team.
Alex818728::yeah but Atlanta beat us in the world series in 95
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Bazinga! That's fuding hilarious. Well yea I guess Atlanta lost the Thrashers and were in danger of losing the Hawks. Seattle lost a championship winning NBA team, terrible NFL team, and baseball..
ZachRamsfelder::Seattle's NFL team isn't so terrible anymore. Nor is Atlanta's. Atlanta's just doesn't know how to win a playoff game. I was at the game to see them put up a grand total of zero offensive points in January in the Wildcard game
KingGeorge53::yes... but Atlanta beat the Tribe in the WS in the 90s  and Seattle won the NBA title and has had a FB team in the Super Bowl.
ZachRamsfelder::I saw that, I live in New Jersey and root for the Giants, Yankees, and the Cavs, so I don't know Cleveland fans' pain, and even I wondered how Cleveland didn't win that one.
Alex818728::right not even good enough to make the list
Carslon12::How about that Tribe... Marson, Kipnis, Kotchman, Brantley, Donald all hitting below .100
Carslon12::and You know things are really bad when Duncan is the ONLY outfielder hitting over .200
KingGeorge53::Not good so far.    We'll see how it goes, but it's a bad first 5 games.
letsgobucks-osu::Haha, I'm already disgusted at how bad their lineup is.
SRStark20::I didn't care about this statement because you put Marson and Donald in there.
Alex818728::still early
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Cleveland has had more championships stolen from them then any other city in America. If you have a worse one, please send me a link.
Alex818728::Cavs the last two lebron years should have won it too
ZachRamsfelder::Buffalo Bills, wide right?
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::6!
letsgobucks-osu::Cavs should have won it at least twice. We had the best team two years in a row, but our "superstar" quit on us.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Indians in 2007, Cavs in 2006. The Browns leaving Cleveland then winning a championship in Baltimore. In the past 13 years, the Indians should have 3 World Series Trophies, Cav's 1 Championship, and Browns 1 championship. So we should have 5.
letsgobucks-osu::Good point, they were down to the final strike quite a few times.
ZachRamsfelder::Texas Rangers in the World Series last year? Not really stolen, but they were one strike away
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::or 97 lol.
letsgobucks-osu::1997*
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Indians 2 outs in 1998. Try again.
Poorguta::I don't want the Pacers to draft anyone in particular, all I want for Christmas is to see the Pacers get a legitimate starting point guard.  I really believe that's all we need to be contenders.  Yeah, we're 3rd in the east right now...but...I hate lebron and even I have to admit the heat would crush us in a series, probably the bulls would wreck us too, just get me a damn PG Santa
ZachRamsfelder::I don't follow the Pacers, cause I'm a Cavs fan, but the Pacers play up to their competition from what I know. I wouldn't be too scared about playing the Heat or Bulls
indycolts56::Beat them twice, and lost the 3rd on our own in OT earlier this year.
ZachRamsfelder::Beware John Lucas III. He is an animal. He actually scares me more than Rose
Poorguta::We've beat the heat once since they got the big three, if i remember correctly (which i may not, terrible memory).  I would prefer to play the bulls- they only have one ultra-athletic monster and those seem to be the pacers' biggest weakness.  The heat have two and every time I see a heat pacers score it's the heat by a lot.  Except for that last game we won, which was SO satisfying
KingGeorge53::As a Cavs fan, I think you're right on target.     I think your team has the right pieces now with just that all star quality PG that would put the Pacer team on top.
SRStark20::My Predictions for the next Cleveland Titles  Of course, me being the biased Cleveland fan, these are all going to fall... sometime soon.  Indians - 2014 World Series Champions  By this time, Santana, Cabrera, Choo, Masterson, Ubaldo, Perez, Tomlin, and Brantley will all be in their primes. Guys like Kipnis, Canzler, Chisenhall will all be heavily developed and contributing. I honestly think either 2014 or 2015 will be the best chance for the Tribe to win a title for a while.  Cavaliers - 2016 NBA Champions  By this time, Kyrie, Gee, and TT will all be in their primes, along with whoever we pick up in seasons beforehand. I see Kyrie being a dynamic superstar by this time. Other draft pickups and young development will have the Cavaliers being an Eastern Conference Super-Power in 2014 and 2015, with them finally taking home the title in 2016.  Browns - 2023 Super Bowl Champions  I honestly am not a keen Browns fan, but I currently know that the team isn't very good, so I'm just going to say it's going to take a solid decade to fit everything together perfectly to finally get to, and win a Super Bowl.   Go Cleveland. Best damn fans in the land!
KingGeorge53::I wish I could be more positive on the Browns.   I really do.    But since 1999, they've been more tan than anything else.
ZachRamsfelder::The Cavs are definitely close to contention. I'm thinking 2015
KingGeorge53::I agree.    One all star out of the SG, SF and C from this draft makes what we already have at least contending for a PO team.   NOT a title contender, but a PO contender.     The other picks this year and next will determine a lot.  ALSO... I'm convinced now after watching B Scott coach, that he's the guy to get it done.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::True either Drummond or Beal and a good backup SG or C in Festus or William Bufford. Dreymond Green PF.
ZachRamsfelder::This year's draft will give us at least one of those pieces.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Need a true center and a shooting guard to throw the hammer down each night.
Alex818728::by 2014 indians will be rebuilidig again, and for browns they may never win it, but football is very unpredicatable
Alex818728::The are constantly rebuilding look who good we were in 2007, next theing you know CC is gone, and Lee replaces him then the next year Lee is gone
letsgobucks-osu::We didn't think they would be rebuilding the year after we almost won the World Series, but it happened. I hope we don't have to put up with that again, but you can't completely rule it out.
SRStark20::Rebuilding in 2014? I don't think so. They'll need to replace Hafner and fix up Sizemore and LF a bit, along with the rotation, but I don't think they'll be even close to rebuilding at this point.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Browns: 2016 Cavs: 2018 Indians: 2020
Alex818728::I can hope
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Please put the pipe down. lol.
Alex818728::Browns 2012 Cavs 2013 Indians 2012
letsgobucks-osu::I hope you're right, but I don't see the Indians winning that quickly or the Browns winning ever.
Carslon12::Cleveland will lose the 4th spot to Toronto. go read the raptors board, they are dedicated to tanking. Their main goal is to keep Cleveland out of that 4th spot...Cleveland's ONLY chance is to tank against Washington TWICE, they've been banking on the fact that WASH and CHAR WON'T let the cavs lose, and so far they've been correct.. Toronto will not win again, they plan to throw to Detroit and NJ, the only two left on their schedule that they might be in danger of winning...
falcoff818::Don't Forget Sacramento too, They have 19 wins too and just lost to NO
Alex818728::doesnt matter what toronto fans want, the team is not trying to tank
KingGeorge53::I don't know about a team effort of tanking.   I do know players get tired during the season.    Maybe a couple players see a good looking chick in the 3rd row and are more interested in that sometimes.    Tanking?    I'm sure it happens, but I don't think you'll ever hear of anyone admitting it while it's happening.
Alex818728::me?
Carslon12::you obviously didn't watch the TOR/CLE game too closely
KingGeorge53::very wise for such a young guy.
KingGeorge53::I'm not worried about it.      Remember where we got Kyrie from?    It was the Clipper pick and wasn't he #8?
Carslon12::It's all about the balls, true it only takes one...but more are better
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::It's a lottery. Watch Toronto fall out of the top 10.
Poorguta::lol
SRStark20::My Draft Prediction  # 3 - Bradley Beal - G # 22 - Draymond Green - F # 33 - Festus Elzlie/Fab Melo - C # 38 - William Buford - G  I'd be fine with this I suppose. I haven't studied deep into the second round yet, so I just threw Buford in.
Man Utd Squad::Buford would be a great pick up
falcoff818::In all honesty he is too inconsistent, He Started off Doing Above Average but He Didn't show up when the Bucks needed him
KingGeorge53::lol... not a bad throw in with Buford.     I really like Festus.   He's the bestest.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::That was a THUNDEROUS DUNK.
KingGeorge53::I'm starting to get a handle on how AC would say it.     Festus throws the hammer down at the Q.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::nvm that sucks.. sounded better in my head lol.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::nickname for Festus: Fiesta Estatic.
KingGeorge53::Or better yet...    Lester to Festus.
KingGeorge53::hahaha   most likely.     But we've had our share of that to go around.   I just like saying "Festus".
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::If Festus is a Cavalier, none will know how to say or spell his last name. lol..
mikeyp2307::you guys see what wade said about the Olympics?
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Ok. W/E. American's will win basketball forever and ever because well... um... we have people who can dunk if the rim is 12 feet. lol.
Its all my fault::Yeah, him and Ray Allen are dopes!! What? Waving the flag and representing your country isn't good enough!?
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::He's to good for them?
ZachRamsfelder::$@%! that you play for America because America is the BEST
mikeyp2307::he thinks that they should get paid to play for the usa bball team
Its all my fault::Wow.. this board has been amazing! Thank you Pacer fans for your respect towards the Cavs. KICK MIAMI'S @$$ if you get the chance!
KingGeorge53::It has been an enjoyable evening.    Hats off to the Pacer fans.
KingGeorge53::Congrats to the Pacers and their fans.     Very good, entertaining game.  Let's go Cavaliers!      ( I do believe in Ping Pong Balls.   I do.  I do.  I do Believe in Ping Pong Balls.)
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::I want 2nd. MKG.
KingGeorge53::He'd be a great addition!    Of course we have a lot of needs.     SG, SF, C  However, I believe if the Cavaliers can draft just ONE All Star in this coming draft, they'll be on track.
ZachRamsfelder::If we have the #1, who do you want?
KingGeorge53::Yes.    That's the kid.    Don't mind my memory.   They say it's one of the first thing that goes.  #1 pick?    hell no.    But he'd be a great pick up.      I don't think he lasts until the 2nd round, but he'd be a good pick with our first pick there.     It'd be a stretch with our Laker pick, but I wouldn't be crying over it if they did.
ZachRamsfelder::Festus Ezli? I agree. He really impresses me. But I don't think he's a #1 pick
KingGeorge53::I tell you a guy I'd love our Cavs to draft along those lines...   That C from Vandy.     I believe he's the most underrated kid on the board right now.
ZachRamsfelder::I don't know. I sound sort of stupid but I'm not high on Davis, I've said it a lot but other big men would abuse him just because of his lateral size
KingGeorge53::Davis
SRStark20::Everyone give the sport and year that you think a Cleveland team will win a championship...  Mine? Cleveland Indians - 2014
mikeyp2307::i agree with king george.
mikeyp2307::i swear to uphold the law
KingGeorge53::I'm voting for you this fall.
DyersEve06::Cavs win in 2015 after lebron returns
matthollabak1::No he plays SS for the cubs :)
mikeyp2307::castro?
KingGeorge53::Lebron can keep his talents in Miami with that Marlins coach.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Lebron can never come back.
Tim Chodzin::Never.
mikeyp2307::i like ur thinking
Tim Chodzin::That LeBron still will never win one :)
Tim Chodzin::In the future! Not in the past, obviously been success back in the 40s for the Tribe and the 60s for the Browns.
mikeyp2307::so what else does ur Crystal ball say?
KingGeorge53::Then Tim, you have a bad memory
Tim Chodzin::Exactly. Because no Cleveland team will ever win one.
SRStark20::a la Cubs?
mikeyp2307::nevers not a year
KingGeorge53::Cavaliers - 2015
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Cleveland Browns - 2016. They need 3 years after getting Matt Barkley.
tatey1001::So the Pacers are 14 games over .500 and are third in the EC.  Yet they are 2nd to last in attendance...Whats it going to take to pack the Fieldhouse???
tatey1001::I'm thinking more of this......http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BY5VbKtgH4
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::that was so awesome haha
matthollabak1::Probably a playoff series win....then you will see everyone dust off their Reggie Miller Jerseys and claim they always had faith in them
SRStark20::Wait till the postseason. Stacked house every night. Take it from a Cavs fan, I know how much fun playoff time can be.
ZachRamsfelder::two words: sexy cheerleaders
ZachRamsfelder::yes, providing sexual services to minors is a must
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Cincinnati Bengal Cheerleaders?
mikeyp2307::tell you what, these boards are really sweet when you dont have ignorant people commentating retarded crap all the time.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::yea we like it troll and jerk free here
Man Utd Squad::Hawks only down by one. Hopefully the game will just end in a draw
Braden1885::We will see you Friday Cavs, This time in our house!
TubbyTime334::Vogel is Boss.
matthollabak1::I love Vogel...I'm just scared how much of that is Brian Shaw and what will happen when he gets a head coaching job next year.
Braden1885::Frankieee! haha
ToneZone3::he is not even being considered as a COY candidate anymore
matthollabak1::The sad part is that Bird will probably lose out to whoever the LAC exec is for that award too....
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::Anybody watchin any of the hockey games?
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::no because my Blow Jackets suck.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::im not familiar with them? all i know of are the fort wayne komets. then again i dont follow hockey too well
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::i wish we had an nhl team. we do have the fort wayne komets though hahaha, theyre pretty d@mn good
Man Utd Squad::Hey man don't be hatin on our Indiana Ice!
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::support my Jackets next year?? :)
SRStark20::Ohio can't even have a winning hockey team haha  We're a lucky sports state though. Best fans in the country.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::well if it makes you feel better we dont even have an nhl team.
fluffymufu::How many more top 5 draft picks does Cleveland need before they start making the playoffs again?
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::It's hard to make the Playoffs when 2 of your 3 best players are gone.. haha.
mikeyp2307::we had 2 in one draft. thats a heck of a start to our rebuild
falcoff818::In all honesty TT wasn't a good pick for 4 Jamison is probally not commign back but we have Varejao who we always force into that Center Position
SRStark20::Uno.
letsg0mets57::One more.
rag63top::Good job Indy, Good job Cavs. Hard fought game down to the wire.   GO CAVS
mikeyp2307::What would you guys do when your respective teams win a championship? When the cavs win one, I honestly dont know if ill make it through the night. The partying in Cleveland would be insane.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::I would probally end up in Jail...
Braden1885::I would be so happy for the Pacers, mostly because I am sick of hearing about the biggest $@%!$@%! in the league on ESPN. Its all about LeBron and Mello. They never talk about the true players like Granger and Collison
matthollabak1::Ooh yea...did you watch the 76ers ESPN game this year?  They didn't even send the B commentating squad.  We got what sounded like interns that had to read their sheets to get names after every shot...it was terrible.
Poorguta::sorry, lebron and melo are WAY better than granger and collison.  and i'm a pacers fan.if you're a fan of a small market team, just resign yourself to almost no media coverage unless the pacers land a marketable super star.  that's literally the only way we will get air time.
mikeyp2307::this is the first time in a long time that the #1 pick didnt have 1 national televised game.
letsg0mets57::true. They do t even talk about Kyrie or anyone underrated.
CLEVELANDCBI::I'd be too drunk and happy to be on here, that's for sure.
ZachRamsfelder::I live in New Jersey and I root for New York teams (Giants, Yankees) except for the Cavs. I don't even know what it would be like not see a championship in decades. I wouldn't know how to react like a fan from Cleveland
ToneZone3::i would riot
letsg0mets57::Cleveland, OKC, Indy, Boston and Portland all are on the top of my best fans list.
letsg0mets57::Some Boston fans are good and some are jerks. OKC packs that arena every game since they were bad when they moved.
mikeyp2307::pacers, suns, utah and bobcats are my list
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::the boston fans during the indiana/boston game the other day were pretty classy
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Boston?? OKC??
SRStark20::Boston fans are jerks.   Back in the day, those Sonics fans were very classy.
matthollabak1::I feel bad for Seattle fans all around.  They lost what 3 HOFers in the prime or ready to hit their prime in baseball? Then lost their entire basketball team that is now one of the best in the NBA.
Braden1885::OKC?
ZachRamsfelder::Boston?
SRStark20::Edition #3 of "Those Guys Were Cavs?"  - Cedric Jackson - Ira Newble - Scott Pollard - David Wesley - Donyell Marshall
Braden1885::$@%! every team has had great players. Pacers have had a TON back in the ABA era! My goodness...
mikeyp2307::Pollard was my dude!
Braden1885::Boy the pacers have liked to win in a dramatic fashion lately! Houston, Knicks, Toronto, Cavs...
ToneZone3::but they spanked the thunder
Braden1885::Haha I know. Odd isnt it?
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Classiest fans in the NBA: 1. Indiana 2. Utah 3. Portland 4. Cleveland 29th: Los Angeles Clippers/Lakers 30th: Miami
jbewlersdayoff::I hope you were joking about Portland. That game had some of the worst trolls and the board degraded into city bashing.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::I do have to say yes, alot of people liked Cleveland only because of James (native of Ohio). But true fan's like the Cav's because there their hometown team.
letsg0mets57::Cavs fans stay with the team.
matthollabak1::I will say right now most of us Indy fans are classy...but wait until the bandwagoners climb back on and you will see us move down that list very fast.
fluffymufu::Are those the top four teams that won't win a championship this decade?
fluffymufu::Guess we'll see
ZachRamsfelder::If they keep their teams together and make an addition or two, the Cavs and Pacers will both win a championship by 2020
matthollabak1::No...those are the bottom 3
letsg0mets57::Maybe not, but have a good future ahead.
mikeyp2307::miami fans were cavs fans 3 years ago
ZachRamsfelder::Every Miami fan I know used to root for Cleveland because they follow their Queen James.
mikeyp2307::amen to that
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Hell no to Miami. I'm all about Ohio.
Man Utd Squad::Knicks are tied for last
letsg0mets57::How bout OKC
letsg0mets57::Portland has great fans.
Braden1885::Not exactly, especially with the Ozzie Guillen stunt. But if you want to judge a 162 game season on the first 4 games go ahead!
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::What is it 2-4?
mikeyp2307::not off to a great start are they?
Braden1885::Marlins arent a joke. A lot of people think they will be a playoff contender
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Miami is a joke in all sports. They can't buy a championship with a new baseball stadium, quarterback, a complete NBA Team, and hockey.. lol
Braden1885::Even the people from Miami?
letsg0mets57::Miami fans are all bandwagon fans.
ZachRamsfelder::Miami has actual fans?
letsg0mets57::Both teams have a bright future ahead and can become a rivalry in a few years in the playoffs.
letsg0mets57::Cavs fought hard tonight really short handed. I count this as a win for them.
jeaneneumosella@me.com::Yo
mikeyp2307::Good game Pacers and good luck in the playoffs. I hope the upsets are plentiful. As for the Cavs, these are the losses you want. Tough competitive never give up losses. The future is bright for both of these teams. Go Cavs!
fluffymufu::Good game from my pacers. Just a veteran guard away from competing. Steve Nash would "put us over the top"
TubbyTime334::It would cool to See Pacers vs Bulls Eastern Finals. Especially since they are so close together, could get pretty heated.
