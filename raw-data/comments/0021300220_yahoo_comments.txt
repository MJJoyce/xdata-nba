Chuck::Nice game by Snell.  Pretty efficient.
Amir::Bulls doing great considering that  they   don't have a player able to attack the rim (Deng is doing great TBH)  , Pistons really look worse than last season when Stuckey is on the bench, wish him 6M Award if he continues to play at this level. Pistons will probably hit Playoff and Minessota, Denver or Lakers will watch them on TV. Very sad NBA regulation.
ron::Pistons have some excellent players. They need a better coach.
Larry::Deng is such an underrated player. May not be the best at anything, but does everything pretty well. Bulls management should look for the piece necessary to replace DRose as he probably will never be the same. There is enough other talent on the team to do quite well.
Cwis::So i just traded my anthony davis for joakim noah on my fantasy team! Smh!
delbert::whats up with greg monroe?? jennings needs to pass more to anyone of his bigs rather then shoot so much.
snackattack::Bulls with a ton of assists tonight.  Like that they are moving the ball again.
none::Mike Dunleavy, why is this guy on the team or in the NBA or is it he just does not fit the Bulls system
Ogbabyace::Its nice to see that the Bulls took that worthless turd Mike Dunleavy out of the starting line up. Now only if they can get rid of Kirk Hinrich the Bull will be okay.
me::The Bulls need to trade away Dunleavy, Boozer and Hinrich........  get draft picks please and move up in the draft to get a top 5 pick.
