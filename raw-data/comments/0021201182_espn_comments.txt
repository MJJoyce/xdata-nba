Ejner1::romo sucks.
Marcus55341::indy will lose to nyk and bos and you never know, maybe philly will try to win that last game of the season
Marcus55341::explain pna..... please enlighten me. It is a proven  fact that if indy loses out and bkn wins out then they get the 3 seed
PNA-5050::Indiana is not losing to a Knicks team without A SINGLE big man, a pretty crappy Boston team that is totally living off their reputation, and an awful Philadelphia squad. They only need to win one of these games, which they will easily.
Marcus55341::wrong, nets have a chance to overtake pacers for the 3seed
PNA-5050::No they don't
FeFyeFoeRun::<b>actually that would be the Knicks. Heat vs Nets ECF's  BANK IT!</b>
PNA-5050::That's literally not even possible.
Effectful::Can't wait to welcome Otto Porter Jr to Cleveland so Alonzo doesn't play anymore.
oldcoach1961::It is about time Scott is giving Kevin Jones Playing time , look at the hustle and work on the boards and some defense.
NBAMASTERMIND::Knicks fans are so delusional!! Everyone is in cruising mode and the Knicks are on the gas heavy lol. This is a great way for a easy first round exit.
Ontario925::@NBAMASTERMIND  The Knicks,Bulls,Heat,Pacers,Thunder,Grizzlies,Spurs,Rockets,Nuggets,and Nets are too good this year to troll. Try the NHL or NASCAR conversation boards to troll kid. This is the wrong year to troll NBA teams.
whitebl09::Right.. and Melo didn't play at all in the 4th quarter. He played just enough to get up a few shots, stay in rhythm and secure the win
flag_me_if_you_can::yeah Melo and JR only playing 29 mins and resting K-Mart, TC and playing Cope at center is really gas heavy... LMAO fool
PNA-5050::Right? Amazing how ignorant people are.
NY_Knicks1stClass::Great win for my boys.. Marvellous I tell you, just Marvellous !!
Nuclear Petting zoo part 7::Da Bulls
lovesports27::You remember how bad the Knicks got it in the playoffs last year haha. Heat could beat them in their sleep. Why does New York always get their hopes up when Melo has been out of the first round ONCE!!
Marcus55341::last years knick team isnt even half as good as this years knick team
caltechman::Thumbs up if you hate the stupid videos that keep loading up on this site
Ontario925::Especially ones that show good hot food. I'm trying to lose wait and those ads keep tempting me to buy them.
alexhernandezh::Superstars are superstars, but it's always that other guy that puts teams over the hump.  JR is finally that player.  I hope he could continue this because early in the season I was starting to hate him.  He has all my love now!!!
Thetimpanikid16::no he is not.....
TheNewYorkKnicksAre::Imagine if the Knicks got kevin love? WOW
Streak4MoreCash::Or gave away David Lee
alexhernandezh::TheNewYorkKnicksAre lol he didnt want to be here anymore, you crazy? He wanted to win and felt we were never going to do that. Well he would have been very happy if he stayed just 1 more year because he would have fit nicely. Problem is, how would him and Amare pair? Both PF's..  Couldn't afford to keep him and still have this team.  Although, with Amare hurting I could see him being more productive.

Streak4MoreCash::JR shot the ball only 16 times... Wow
jaharder88::AP recap - "Anthony and Smith even added a combined three assists, not bad considering it's rare either gives up the ball for anyone."  A snarky comment considering they average about 5 assists a game.
TheNewYorkKnicksAre::the best
Victor6229::Irving is nice but he is injury prone. his career could easily be altered by injuries
TheNewYorkKnicksAre::i miss watching kevin love play :(
TheNewYorkKnicksAre::Very true
Blue Power Juice::Ok I guess you do want to learn the abc"s? so here we go
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NY::Curry shoots 44% from three for his career WOW. I haven't really appreciated this dude enough. WOW
Blue Power Juice::Hello knick fans would you like to learn the abc's?
Fifty Shades of....MAROON::The fact that carmelo anthony hasn't won a scoring title yet is kind of shocking
rainmaker2007::While with the Nuggets he was leading the league in scoring before Iverson joined the team. After that, his average went down.
NY NBK Far Superior x.::He'll get it this year
azzyfbaby::best thing for knicks is thatt brooklyn gets the 3 seed and hopefully chicago gets the 5th..that way we either have brooklyn or atlanta in the second round..let miami get slammed with chi or indy and get them tired
carshawn03::I hate that logic. Great teams don't position themselves to play certain teams. You have to beat the best to be the best!
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NY::GOOD GOD, Curry is playing out of his mind.
Fifty Shades of....MAROON::Yeah he's a stud
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NY::Enough on the Heat though. It's about the KNICKS.
YogaBeer::... and the CAvaliers!    Cavs are going to be a good team next year.
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NY::Young Wade -Today's Lebron - Toronto Bosh  I think they would challenge the Bulls record if they had the chemistry.
FREEWAYE::I think Wade and Lebron has the best chemistry in the NBA..It's Bosh that doesn't get into rhythm with them.
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NY::BuFakar - shaq and kobe? it was just shaq. kobe almost sabotaged it for them.and wade and lebron show more appreciation for one another.  They were unstoppable. Nothing to do with "Caring for one another"
BuFakar::shaq and kobe? it was just shaq. kobe almost sabotaged it for them.and wade and lebron show more appreciation for one another.
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NY::"That's why nobody can give the Heat compliments..Their fan's start getting carried away"  EXACTLY
FREEWAYE::That's why nobody can give the Heat compliments..Their fan's start getting carried away..I meant today NBA,when Wade is healthy.
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NY::BuFakar - better than pippen and jordan.  Nah, i don't even think they're better than Shaq-Kobe let alone Jordan-Pippen.
BuFakar::better than pippen and jordan.
FREEWAYE::It's after 11:00 pm ET the trolls must have came out from under there bridge..
nyknicks4thewin::its 11oclock- do you know where your heat trolls are?
