PKM::Hopefully Jordan plays.
Matt::Man, where's Millsap tonight?!  Sheesh.
bugjackblue::Big Al steals the ball!  And gives Horford a wedgie!
fup duck::MKG is playing like an allstar
cesar::Hawks 8.
WADE AND JOY ARAI::yeah, what happened to Milsap???
Aaron::what happened to teague?!?!?!
C::Why is Milsap only playing 20min
Cyril::The sad thing is that Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, and Kyrie Irving will probably make the All-Star team this year while Jeff Teague and John Wall go unrecognized.    Also, Josh McRoberts is an unconventional player, but he produces.  It's nice to see Charlotte giving him an opportunity.  Would be nice to see a few more rebounds and blocks, but you've got to appreciate a power forward knocking down three's and dishing out more than 4 assists a game.
Mohd Yusuf R::Big Al and McBob definitely complements one another..already 3pt made by McBob
