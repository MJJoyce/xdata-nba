vonsteve6868::I don't care about Brooklyn the team. But, man, I like their new logo and look.
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::Their arena is dope too.
tripleteamthreat::Are the RAPTORS really better with out Bargnani?
Arnold23Mc::hes not garbage.. he has skill he can shoot the 3 and post up.. but hes on a bad team..  so its like who cares? unless you a raptor fan.. but i dont think they have that good of a fan base. hence them being a bad team.
Arnold23Mc::who cares? its the raptors.
tripleteamthreat::Well, for one, I lot of people were claiming he was garbage.

Arnold23Mc::2 years 24mill for what too look weird running up and down the court..  kris is overpaid. brook isn't that special ethier.. hes not that athletic and.. he cant make his own shots its usally Dwill feeding him the ball.
Arnold23Mc::nets overpaid on those 2 guys. while blatche is the best big man they have overall...
gerald_5::i was at the rockets board...   delusional lin fans saying w/o harden lin is a 20/10/5 guy... i $@%!$ you not
KnixTix::OMG!
gerald_5::williams for 3... CLANK  JJ actually had a pretty good game, to bad it wasnt against the knicks
sportsfan1014::no Fields no win, Raptors must missed him a lot..
KnixTix::Fields is garbage
ThisSiteTakesItDeep::Wizards, Thunder &amp; Rockets... Interesting..
ThisSiteTakesItDeep::I dont get why everybody acts like Lopez is always healthy.. Really?
ThisSiteTakesItDeep::Funny how you stopped at the 2011 season, GRAND total of 5 games last year... Ohh but he is the key to their success.. Fukouttahere with ya $@% backwards stats
djny2k12::Fact: Brook Lopez played 82 consecutive games each season from 2008 - 2011 (3 yrs)  They are being extra cautious with him and rightfully so.
The-INFAMOUS-CRUZZZ::How's Fields?
JSimp140::Where's Jay? Why isn't he at the 12-12-12 concert? Would he have been there if the venue had been Barclays and not the Garden? Is that really his MO?

VanCityRep::Change the name to HUskies already
jpazz711::if your not going to play brooks, i'm sure other teams would want him
lake_405::Toronto quit sucking so much so we can get your pick.
Premo S::Nets without Brooks is a whole other team
Premo S::I dont care what people say about Wallace .. he's a baller - but Nets are truly hurting without Lopez - since when did he become hits liability w injuries !!
GeorgeTownDC29::Bargnani was out
Poor Oregon::I thought the Raptors were supposed to be good this year.
jpazz711::the year after that
celebrate good times come on::next year
Rezo201::I feel like we won by default and blew another big lead. These blown leads are like Groundhog Day.
Mr. Bradford::Not a bad night for Raps' Ed Davis. The guy had an awesome game in a losing effort. Valanciunas and Calderon put in solid nights as well. Toronto played three solid quarters, but the 3rd killed them.   A lot of turnovers in this game...
steven6623::where brooklyn at where brooklyn at. 6th place.lmao
mdtuzo::Well we won...
katx5h::Damn, this team would be way different if D-Will shot 45% instead of 39%...like legitimately good type of different.
newyorkjets269::Overall, not great but without brook, i'll take it. hope he's back friday
Arnold23Mc::BROOK IS OVERRATED... HE ISN'T THAT ATHLETIC AND HE CAN'T MAKE HIS OWN SHOTS HE IS OVERPAID JUST LIKE KRIS... ANDRE BLATCHE IS THE NETS BEST BIG MAN OVERRALL.
Boltzsixonenine::its because their offense is brooks, he's the first option and not sure if thats a good thing cause if brooks is off, who's gonna carry the team? There is no reason why they cant dominate the raptors especially if their missing so many players. I understand there will be some off nights but everyone is schooling the raptors and nets can barely cover the spread...
Boltzsixonenine::Struggling against a team that a top 5 college basketball team can beat them... I say nets need a solid power forward in the line up cause you're not going to beat the knicks nor the heat if you play them in a series... no way...
Juwansumonis10::It's December. We will see in a few months. While I agree the Nets haven't played Miami well, they have played two great games against the Knicks.
Boltzsixonenine::Nets got long way to go even if brooks is in...
Premo S::Idiot .. with Brook this is a whole different team
Juwansumonis10::How do you figure? They are 10-4 with him.
FightingIrish595::i told yall the nets would win
Mets2410::Thank god the Nets won and thank god the game is over lol good job Brooklyn
audelo55::Clay Thompson schooling LeBron.
Boltzsixonenine::These mofos are up by 15 with 4 minutes left and cant close the game...
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Pietrus didn't hit a 3 and Derozan never went to the line..weird game...
Borderlands 2 sucks::if any franchise deserved to be euthinized, its the Craptors.
Boltzsixonenine::Wow, i am never betting on nba games again. I will stick with college basketball. fucc this shi.t
Boltzsixonenine::I know, nets just stop playing defense and giving back the ball to them...
bigtymer0056::sucks... Up 13 with 2 and half minutes left and can't cover... Seems like I'm always on the wrong side of these games
JoeyDorsey4MVP::How does Derozan play 44 minutes and not go to the line once? Did, the refs just not want to call fouls?
gri400::the ref blocking humps free throw attempt made this game worth watching :)
danny42000000::what
gkram2345::did something happen to gerald wallace?  *no foul trouble, but still got few/no minutes late
Juwansumonis10::I didn't get a chance to see the game tonight. But last night he banged knees with JR Smith. Perhaps limiting his minutes because of that?
taco bell surprise::not sure what the raps worst season was but this one  is gonna challenge it
159Yanks::Nets finally wins
danny42000000::kdjdjjdjdjddjqwl
DeMarcus Cousins Fan::The Raptors = failures forever
Qster15::??? how to you make a bad pass with under 4 seconds left in the game???? Learn to hold onto the ball.. idi.ots..
MLBcorrupted::They just fuked everyone on the spread lol
danny42000000::raptiors suk $@%
Anywho510::This game is clearly fixed believe it or not but fixed
159Yanks::how so?
gri400::lol
arvinramroop::No it's not
bronsonbrooks::can't believe the Nets didn't cover
Qster15::depends when you got the line... it was -4.5 before 4pm EST
audelo55::Fixed
arvinramroop::u stupid?
