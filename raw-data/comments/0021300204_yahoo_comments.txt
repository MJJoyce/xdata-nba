Steve::Josh, you are NOT a three-point threat. So please stop pretending that you are...
Eric::Would have thought the Bucks learned a couple years ago that filling your roster with castoffs that never lived up to their billing did nothing for your team and yet they went that route for 2013-14
RC::jennings is a very dynamic player when he's on...absolutely torched the bucks 1st quarter then settled back into pg role & dished out 13 assists. it can get ugly when he starts shooting too much but his upside can get a team an extra win or 2 come playoff time...saw him almost singlehandedly beat the hawks in a playoff game a couple years ago his 1st year in milwaukee.
coryt::Let's definitely use tax money to build an arena so we can keep the bucks...
Rico M::Brandon Knight is a turnover machine in this game.. He's trying too hard against his former team.
dont have one::Any one that knows anything about Herb knows that he likes boys in shorts. The problem with the bucks is the fact these are the only boys that like Herb back.
KMike::There's only eight teams with records about .500 in the entire league so far this season, five in the west and three in the east. The Pistons need to show their skeptical fan base(me) that they can actually win two games in a row in a league that is anything but stellar right now. I might visit the Palace as a result.
fup duck::this is more embarrassing than Braun
Steven N.::Brandon Knight is awful. His career Ast-TO ratio is bad as a centers
BHK::Larry Drews. Explain your logic
