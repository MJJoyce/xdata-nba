Hope this helps a bettor out there not having much luck.
anotherasianrapper::as a 17 year old, this is the first year i've ever rooted for my suns to lose, for obvious reasons, draft pick
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Post game Suns announcers are clueless just like the team they follow. Tom Hammonds said.the hawks are not known for their outside shooting when in actuality this is the best 3 point shooting team in Hawks history. Mostly due to Korver I admit but do your research buddy.  And his buddies co signing by saying giving up 30 fast break pts to the hawks is bad and compared it like the Kings and Warriors are something so special as opposed. I lol.

Lemuel7043::GG suns fans
Sun Devils-Diamondbacks-Cardinals-Suns-Sun Devils::As many of you know,I have posted the message"Spurs fans suck." many times. So why do I hate the Spurs? Because my Phoenix Suns got SCREWED in 2007. That Amare suspension was totally unfair and unwarranted and it cost the Suns the key game of that series,game 5. It was totally unfair and unwarranted and it may well have cost the Suns the 2007 NBA Championship. It definitely cost the Suns the 2007 Western Conference Championship at the very least. After the tragedy of 2007,being a Suns fan gives me no choice but to hate the Spurs.
