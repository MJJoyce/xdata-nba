Amir::Inconsitency  Kemba Walker is preforming is amazing, never saw that in 25 years of watching NBA and European higher level basketball, hope Charlotte draft of sign serious PG next year cos they clearly have team for East playoffs.
kevin::Play Zeller more minutes, please.  The guy comes off the bench hits 3 straight buckets and then back to the bench he goes??? Why does a loosing team not play their 1st round pick so he can develop his game?
edward::I think I saw the Magic coach driving around Orlando in a tank?
Tim::I think if Oladipo puts up 25 points and has a great game, Orlando has it in the bag.
MARK FREDRIC::Kemba please try to make a basket...
MARK FREDRIC::but even if Kemba has a very bad FG for this game, gotta hand it to him... 4 blocks is pretty impressive.
PKM::Kemba had 4 blocks, how is that possible?
Jim R::Charlotte's guards are going to have to shoot better than 25% in games; my high school players who played were close or above 50%
­­®Kontrabida™::jordan is the worst executive and talent evaluator... shame on this man...
PKM::Magic sure aren't winning many games.
