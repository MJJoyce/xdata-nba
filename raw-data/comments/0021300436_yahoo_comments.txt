Michael::1 game out of first and hanging on to the #8 seed.  Time to dump Wallace and Lee for anything and maybe  something to put between Green's ears.
Chris M::Extend Bennett's numbers out for about 35 minutes - 10 pts, 10 rebs (5-6 off), 4 asst, 2 stls, and 2 blocks.  Not too bad - maybe he just needs minutes and Kyrie to help bring him along.  All you haters need to understand this is a very, very young team with all the upside in the world - people have been down on Waiters, Tristan, Zeller, Bennett, etc. - give them time and they will be like the Blazers in 2-3 years.  Same danm thing for the Celtics.  Heck neither team is any worse than Brooklyn, Knicks, Bulls, Hawks, etc.
scotty::Celtics are winning way too much.  This isn't the tanking I remember.
KEITH::T Thompson not getting any better. He is very average nba forward. Could b another bad high draft pick.
Trace Mann::Dang the CAVS are already 9 games under 500 and it`s not even January. How are they so bad?
Mister E::Wow the Cavs suck, will it be a third number 1 pick in 5 yrs??? I hope not, they really don't deserve it.
Tony Anthony::Wow what a terrible call. The ball was clearly off the rim yet they still called basket interference. Well the Cavs are still going to lose regardless.
Luke::We almost lost 4 in a row, 4 games with leads in each one. Stevens is pathetic.
Michael::Anthony Bennett was a great pick for us.....
