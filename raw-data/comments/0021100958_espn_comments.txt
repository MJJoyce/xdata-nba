Codeine Jones::Mike Brown: Kill the head and the body will die.  MWP: Harden is the best passer on that squad.  Mike Brown: Remember me, I've got the first one. I've got the first one.
DNuggs2350::At the game it was great, good job Masai! way to put a hard working team together, now lets just play like that every night!
Reality_And_Truth::Ty Lawson is great....most under rated player in the NBA.......
ChimeraLycan::typical McGee - only plays decent vs lesser big men. against Howard, he's nowhere to be found
trizzo23::mcgoof was going against a 6 foot 8 inch guy that was glued to floor and acting like he was doing it against bill rusell..he is a clown
c5a1t3s::hahaha wow the hate is strong in you.
diehardnr1::actually, vs DEN it is Howard who is no where to be found...we do not care what Javale did or did not do as a Wiz...as a Nugget he is 1-0 vs ORL...including about 5 or 6 highlight moments.  Still needs polishing...but the move to DEN was the best thing that could have happened to McGee
paul2285::Keep Rolling Nugz, we want the Lakers and that Artest clown
1AKERZCHARGERZTROJANZ::Lmmfao Chicken Mcnuggets don't won't that ,really puffing all up because they beat the Magic that been playing poorly for about a month. Even with Howard yea ok lol.
diehardnr1::Great win by the Nuggz...way to finish the regular season in The Can!  Nuggz are starting to remind me of the team that started out the season... Glad Faried wasn't injured...cuz this flow is happening due to having most of the pieces back...  Take the Sonics South down a notch or two next game!  GO NUGGETS!!!
Rdiu::see these scrubs around me? thats why i wanted to leave  ------Howard
ChimeraLycan::Howard IS a scrub. he's a #2 guy, not a #1/leader. Leaders don't make excuses and they take all the blame, even if it's deserved
fliptide....::you dont have a $@%!$@% clue.
paul2285::Ryan Anderson is their 2nd best player, that's kinda funny
Magicmike321::I don't get the joke either...
DTangMF::why is that funny?

bluecheese555::So if Howard and Nelson both miss the Bobcats game, the odds of Charlotte winning go from 1% to what? 10%? 20? Dare I say 25%?
DEUBLER12::Sadly, as a Magic fan, we lost to them with both of them.
