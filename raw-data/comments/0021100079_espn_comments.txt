Pinkycuh::Lol now chumps!!!!
Antony2471::SIX BLAZERS on the All Star Ballot.  The MOST in the ENTIRE Western Conference! Not LA, Dallas, Oklahoma, Denver, blah blah blah, none other than Rip City!
jahraffe3::"I'm a scorer, so I can't get down on one game," said Durant, the two-time scoring champion. "I can't let it snowball to the next." All I ever hear Durant talk about is how he's a scorer and how his team relies on him to score. To me, that's not the makeup of a champion. And, again, this is a team sport. Durant may win every scoring title from now until retirement but whether he'll be a champion in this league is highly questionable at this point. I love Brandon Roy and everything he did for us and our community but, arguably, his retirement has re-focused this team to be a team who plays as a team to win as a team.
OFrog::I'm not ready to annoint OKC the best in the West because ESPN writers say so. They may have peaked with the roster they have. They lack inside scoring, and lockdown defense. Of course they have progressed well from the dark Seattle days, but sometimes that progression has limits. I just don't like perimeter oriented teams to win championships.
KWGonnaScore::Just imagine how good OKC would be with the heart and effort that Portland plays with. Well, Nate McMillan is the best coach in the NBA IMO too. But theri pla is a good example for OKC to follow
jahraffe3::As far as the "it's one game" comments on here, what I'm seeing on this end is it's two games in a row OKC and that "one game" last night was won by Rip City, not lost by the Thunder. The Blazers are far more dangerous than OKC given their depth and given their team play and team-play-based production. Although Durant is the best in the league and Harden is vastly improved, Westbrook is a chucker, a head case, and no Rose as some on her have maintained, and the rest of OKC's starting five and reserve corps are mediocre at best.  Someone on here actually said OKC lost because Sefolosha was sick...REALLY?! A dude that averages barely 5 points a game, a whopping 1 assist, and a blow-me-away 4 rebounds? Ha! We got six legit guys spreading the ball around night in and night out, playing for each other on both ends of the floor with nothing to lose. Then you add to that mix the two elder statesmen in the league to be the glue guys and the enforcers down low? Wow! Forget about it! OKC is way over hyped by ESPN and other analysts. Again, Durant may be our next Jordan but the Blazers are far closer to the Bulls teams of that time than the Thunder can ever dream! This is a team game regardless of the powers-that-be making it a "star driven league" (one of my other favorite lame comments on here).
jahraffe3::SIX Blazers on the All Star ballot, most in the West. Exactly my point.
OFrog::Have to agree with most of your points. The depth behind Harden is a disaster. Sefolosha and Cook are way too one dimensional. You need balanced scoring, both inside out, low post and perimeter. You need lock down d, team d. OKC are the glamour pick for moving up another step but I just do not see it.
OFrog::Way too early, but true form is beginning to show. ESPN has this wonderful habit of deluding the public with bad perceptions.
nba is the worst::Too early to predict anything meaningful - but it's clear ESPN's two favs are overrated at present
makaio1985a::God I hate OKC Thunder, especially Clay, thanks Portland, hopefully more teams can do this
PortlandBlazers1004::Stop saying Durant had an off night, he was defensively raped by Wallace and Batum. Get over it.
RIP City Beav::Durant definitely looked tired out there, very little energy.  Now, whether that was because of the condensed schedule, the defense making him work for everything or some other reason, I don't know.  But, any reason could really sink this team as OKC won't be sneaking up and surprising anyone.  They will get everyone's best shot night after night because they have been crowned the "team to beat".  It seems like the second ESPN expects you to win, you are probably screwed.
CBass1317::I think you are right.  KD looked tired.  Wallace dragging KD into the post and making KD work hard on defense appeared to be very effective.  KD was on a back to back, but that is the norm this season.
NBASantas::People HAVE to start taking RIP CITY seriously NOW. PERFECT free agent signing. TONS of Christmas CHEER. http://nbasantas.blogspot.com/2011/12/santa-blazes-trails.html
OFrog::Your site is LAME.
Nique_Olajuwon_Ewing::All you have to do is force KD to the perimeter and he becomes a chucker. Its getting to be a real problem
texrcana24::I'm debating basketball on here, not stooping to your level on this stuff.  "See my balls"...that is what we've come to on these boards.  I'm done with you.
CBass1317::Calling a comment a "close second" to being the "dumbest comment" ever seen is debating basketball?  I didn't see any debate from you at all.  You made no counterpoint, and did not address the subject of the post.  Insulting someone's comment certainly is not equal to debating.  Just saying ...
texrcana24::Very mature and logical rebuttal, I appreciate you making my point more clear
Nique_Olajuwon_Ewing::"texrcana24 This might be one of the dumbest comments I've seen on here in a long time"  Dripping with maturity and logic.
texrcana24::This is a close second.....see reply below
Nique_Olajuwon_Ewing::see my balls
JDiddy8720::Honestly, this shows ONCE AGAIN what a fake tough-guy Kendrick Perkins is #soweak
texrcana24::Once again, as stated above, I appreciate you simply by commenting again, proving my point.  Nique and you must come from the same gene pool.
texrcana24::This might be one of the dumbest comments I've seen on here in a long time
JDiddy8720::^^^ THIS is the dumbest comment I've seen on here in a long time #whyareyoucommenting
58rhodes::Go Blazers
texrcana24::Too many people are trying to over analyze this.  The Thunder just got out played in Dallas and had a bad game last night.  Bad games happen.  I was at the game last night and the Blazers were just the better team.  That's it.  KD was off, Sefalosha was sick, Harden played well, Westbrook was streaky, Collison was good, Aldridge was best.  The Blazers hit big shots when they needed to and looked like the better team last night.  No need to dwell, just move on and they'll be fine.  It's still a long (short) season.
texrcana24::There weren't any excuses in there.  The Thunder still win bad games too.  I'm not taking anything away from them or crowning them anything yet.  Just saying, a 2 game window is extremely small and practically irrelevant when judging a team.
chubby rain::The Bulls still win bad games,  ( Lakers ,Hawks ) so NO excuses.
manewto1::This should be an excuse board instead of a messege board. Whinners will always whine. Thats what we have to live with these days. A bunch of people who think they know everyhting about sports and cant hold a damn job. Go eat your own farts you smug ##@$%$holes!!!!
kobnk2007::Wait till Oden comes back to provide moral support from the bench. Blazers will be unbeatable!
conlevis2::this is what happens when your star player is having an off night and doesn't know when to stop shooting and start creating.
nba is the worst::Is that you, Kobe?
clipctb::Actually, Felton outplayed Westbrook last night!
clipctb::Felton is the difference.  Felton is much better than Miller, and Denver was stupid for trading him.  Felton knows how to run the fast break and feed Aldridge the ball.  Portland is going to make a lot a noise in the west if they stay healthy!
tcjc18::Felton is sick but Crawford is the real "spark plug" for the Blazers.  Every time he touches the ball something seems to happen
Coltonbball12::No the Miller-Felton trade was a great one for both teams.  Denver is so young and already had a few guards but no real experience.  Miller is a true veteran and a veteran is what the nuggets needed.  Also Miller was a great leader for Portland and the Portland coach said that his leadership is truly missed this year.  Both teams aren't complaining about the trade because both players fit into their new systems greatly.
ok_sooner82::they need him to play a little like he WAS playing, it makes him unpredictable  if u have a player like him with a guy like KD playing with him u don't know if he's going to give the ball to someone else or pull up and shoot
super red espresso snowflake::no, they just need for durant to shoot better
ok_sooner82::anyone notice how the last 2 games Westbrooks turnovers went down and assists went up and they still lost, I noticed a few games last year where the same thing happened ...thats why I said and u don't want to turn him into a true PG
Flyerz2k12::I try to fathom like how big of a failure of life to do what some of these spammers do.  Its like if you do go outside (whch I doubt), what do you tell your "friends"   Ok I gave them too much credit saying they go outside and have friends, but you get the point...I'm sure they've talked to someone before and what do the spammers say to other people when asked what do they do with their lives... I sit and spam sports pages all day???
_TheSixthHeatle_::Borderline personality disorder is a disorder where&nbsp;individuals experience frequent, strong and long-lasting states of&nbsp;aversive&nbsp;tension, often triggered by rejection, being alone or  failure. Individuals are very sensitive to the way others treat them, reacting strongly to perceived criticism or hurtfulness. Their feelings about others are negative, generally after a disappointment or perceived threat of losing someone.&nbsp;Individuals with BPD are deliberately manipulative&nbsp;or difficult, with &nbsp;inner pain and turmoil, powerlessness and defensive reactions, or limited&nbsp;coping&nbsp;and communication skills. "Trolling" is a common release for individuals with BPD.
ok_sooner82::they r probably 14-15 year olds up past their bedtime anyway hard to imagine an actual adult being this childish
Rip_City27::seriously lol its a pathetic life they have
ok_sooner82::FYI they ban them from their IP address
ok_sooner82::their lines r closed wait 5 hrs the last spammer I reported was booted from ESPN all togeather
Flyerz2k12::If this is true good work, hopefully Espn will start tightening this up its getting worse n worse each day i come here.
