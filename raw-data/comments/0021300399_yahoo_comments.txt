No_Rain_Check::Gosh, they played this game at San Antonio, and won by double figures.
Austin::Credit to the Thunder, this team is playing the best in the NBA, and for some reason Reggie Jackson has career best games against us. I was extremely disappointed Kawhi Leonard had to miss the game tonight. We really needed him tonight, but stuff happens and the Spurs couldn't overcome his absence. We'll try to do better next time, but good game tonight Thunder.  Go Spurs Go!
gforce::Reggie Jackson off the bench with another nice game.
Vlad::at least the spurs held durant to 17 pts. last game he was bottled up pretty good too, and okc only shot 18 ft tonite so there are some positives, but overall a disappointing loss at home. gotta play better defense. 113 pts is way too many
Aktion Pak::russell westbrook eats tony parker alive in their matchup; tony parker is really having hard time matching up against athletic point guards can' believe it took only 5 games for heat to take okc and took them 7 games against spurs when it's very clear okc are way better and talented than spurs
Anthony::I'm an ancient Laker fan, and many don't understand that SA becomes most dangerous during the playoffs. No rub against OKC, a very good team. But SA has wiped the Lakers off the court in the playoffs so many times that it gives me a headache.
Prentis P::FOR THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED- I WON'T COME BACK TO READ HATE REPLIES NOR COMMENTS POSTED ABOUT ME SO ENJOY REPLYING TO YOURSELVES & ENJOY YOUR STUPIDITY LOL  Like I said Spurs beat weak to average teams but the losses they have now are from elite teams. They can't beat the Thunder (7-2 in last 9 games vs Spurs), Heat, Pacers, nor Blazer in a best of 7 games. Spurs lack defense, lack 7 footers, lack rebounders, & rely on 3 pointers. Where were the Spurs fans when they CHOKED in the Finals? Prentis P, Tay, BB, Terry, Shaw, Phillip, Straitballin, Chapscat, Moses, Donald, proudveteranwoman, Guest, etc? I watched NBA for 27 years & I never seen a team so pathetic & choke like the Spurs. Double digit lead in the 4th, up by 5 with 28 seconds left, Leonard missed 1 freethrow to close out the Finals & Pop took out his rebounders & starters at the end like an idiot! They CHOKED as USUAL LOL. THIS IS THE 5TH SEASON I WILL SAY IT, SPURS WON'T WIN THE TITLE!  2014- Will CHOKE in the playoffs 2013- CHOKED in game 6 after having the game won & CHOKED against the Heat in Game 7 2012- CHOKED losing 4 straight games after winning 20+ games straight, best record in the west, & being up 2-0 with home court advantage. BIGGEST CHOKE IN HISTORY! PATHETIC! 2011- CHOKED in the 1st round to a 8th seeded team after having the best record in the west! PATHETIC! 2010- Swept by a non-defensive team 2009- CHOKED 1st round to a 6th seeded in only 5 games. PATHETIC! 2008- CHOKED in 5 games 2004- CHOKED 2nd round losing 4 straight games after winning 20+ games straight, best record in the NBA, & being up 2-0 with home court advantage. SAME AS 2012! BIGGEST CHOKE IN HISTORY! PATHETIC!  2002- CHOKED 2nd round in 5 games after Duncan having a mvp season 2001- CHOKED being swept after having best record in the NBA & all games were blow outs! PATHETIC! 1996- CHOKED in 5 games 1st round to a 7th seeded team. PATHETIC! 1995- CHOKED after having the best record in the NBA & Robinson winning MVP. Hakeem took him to school! (Best center ever!) 1994- CHOKED 1st round 1991- CHOKED in 4 games 1st round to a 7th seeded team after winning the division
rene::Lets go westbrook another double double
Commenter::Combination of durant and westbrook is what makes this thunder team unbreakable!
Vlad::okc is on a roll. 9 straight wins. we just ran into a freight train tonite. pop said we might have lost to them last year in the playoffs if only westbrook was healthy.  they got our number right now. thats a good team over there
