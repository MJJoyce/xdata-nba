No Name::Joe Dumars' track record as a talent evaluator is something to behold.  He is the only GM that would waste a first round pick on a shooting guard that CANNOT shoot the ball. Caldwell-Pope shot poorly BOTH years in college and so far in his NBA career, cannot score, cannot create his own shot, yet, he starts for the #$%$-Ons.  The guy shoots 35% from the floor, makes 1 of every 8 three pointers, scores 7 points and plays sloppy defense but you drafted him in the lottery-knowing he won't be with you this time next year?  What a waste.
No Name::Andre Drummond cannot make foul shots and has no go to move. Josh Smith has a awful shot selection with a low basketball IQ. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope cannot shoot at all. Brandon Jennings has a awful history with his shots for his career. Greg Monroe is very limited offensively.  I just don't get the Pistons starting lineup.
PKM::It's kinda sad that a team like the Pistons might actually make the playoffs in the East.
Anton::Pistons still in holiday mode.
Richard L::Oladipo had 11 assists and only 1 turnover. Must be one of his better games.
Boog62::Is Nicholson on his way out of Orlando?
smokey::How many threes will Josh Smith miss tonight? 3,4?
No Name::Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is going to make folks in Detroit forget about the legendary Lance Blanks signing.  The Pistons used a lottery pick to select a nonshooting shooting guard.
Esau::I will say it again...who its it possible that Josh Smith got 54 millions
Amir::- 20 Pistons = Hard fail team
