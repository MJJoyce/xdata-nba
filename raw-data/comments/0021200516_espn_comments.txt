Manuel Karem::Hip hip, JOSE!
Petro19::Sixers suck - can we trade the entire team for a great NFL coach?
foycur::How's that Andrew Bynum thing workin out for ya, Philly?
Mumu8833::Better than the Iggy thing
AnOldWiseHawk::Any chance anytime soon that the 76ers will figure out that Doug Collins is not a good coach?
Baby J.Cole::http://xat.com/ESPNPeople
FEAR_THE_HEAT::Sixers are terrible
PhillyDawg99::That is a fact.
taco bell surprise::its hard to believe with all that  talent the Lakers only have 15 wins
NickFoles1::The players no longer respect Doug Collins and his decision making. The guy toys with the lineup too much and does not know how to use his players. We gave our best center to Orlando in Nic Vucevic because Collins had no patience in waiting for him to develop. The kid had 29  rebounds in a game the other night.
BRAY5150::Don't worry GS the clippers will beat Memphis for you guys like they always do
BRAY5150::Warriors fans loved Jack a few weeks ago now they want him gone. Way to give up on the guy warriors fans
BRAY5150::Clippers playing like crap with 7 to's so far. They better wake up or the Mavs could steal one
FlyGuys623::well the flyers start of the season vs the pens. hockey cant come soon enough
erinbaby1997::Screw the greedy owners and players, who cares, ho hum.
binkinainteasy::Welp the Sixers are officially in the lottery hunt
foycur::They're always in the lottery hunt, it seems.
Why must I be a Philadelphia fan. All the teams suck.::<b> Didn't we trade the pick to the Heat or was it protected? </b>
binkinainteasy::Protected through 2015. Beyond 2015 it becomes two 2nd round picks
CoreyGallagherArt::protected, if we make the playoffs the Heat get it
potato623::This is Bynum's fault
CoreyGallagherArt::Most despised 'Sixer' ever if he bolts? He would be in the conversation
DENIMCHlCKEN::Wasn't really Weber's fault though...the dude just got old. Bynum can't even be called a Sixer until he plays haha.
potato623::Hmmm...I don't know, I still hate Chris Webber
Im_in_a_Lackadaisical_daze::Worse teams in the nba: 1. Wizards 2. Bobcats 3. Pelicans 4. Sixers?
shaun9313::the hornets
foycur::Who are the Pelicans?
19brom::id stick orlando in their to
CoreyGallagherArt::Right now, yes, although head to head I'm not sure we beat any of those teams which is sad
Im_in_a_Lackadaisical_daze::Id say we beat the Bobcats but thats it
potato623::Worst and yes
CoreyGallagherArt::To clarify, if we DONT tank Heat get our pick. We make the playoffs, our pick goes to the Heat. We miss the playoffs we keep it.  Magic dont get a pick from us until after the Heat do im 99.9% sure.  So getting the 8th seed would pretty much be robbery because not only would the Heat beat the crap out of us theyd take our pick and run too.   TAAANNNNNKKKKK MODE!
Raptorsfan080::but then were 5 games out of the 8th. NEGATIVE MUCH?
CoreyGallagherArt::We just lost a franchise record 4 games in a row by 18 points and we're 5-16 in our last 21... Negative? Yes, yes I am   See, Raptorsfan thought I was referring to his team, words cannot describe. TANK SIXERS TANK!
potato623::What haha contradict much haha
potato623::Nah, crappy draft class, would rather compete
CoreyGallagherArt::We're 4.5 games ahead of the Bobcats and about to be last in our division, the word compete does not compute
potato623::That road trip killed us :( F### Disney on Ice
patsmayo1::heres the story of the night, 13-41 FG shooting for Turner, Holliday, and Hawes arguably your 3 top players, against a weak raptors Defense, not gonna cut it philly, this team is freefalling
shaun9313::I've been saying we need a real dominant scorer for years!!!
Raptorsfan080::our defence is much improved and imo is better than the 76ers
potato623::Hahaha at Hawes being a top 3 player...maybe top 12
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::yeah hawes is not a top three player
DENIMCHlCKEN::Wow is it ever getting ugly in Philly. Jrue and Thad need some help. Even if Bynum comes back they may already be too far out of it. At least Nikola Vucevic is averaging a double-double so far this year! Man this is pathetic and hard to watch.
CoreyGallagherArt::I'm an advocate of Doug, but this could cost him his job, did you see him arguing with Turner on the bench? To make it worse Moultrie was snickering at DC on the bench while it was going on.  One has to go, they obviously hate each other
DENIMCHlCKEN::This was Turner's year to prove he can play. He started off decent but is now showing his true colors. He just is not that good. He has been terrible since he had to fill in for Jrue at PG for a while. I wonder if that hurt is confidence, knowing he doesn't have what it takes to run an offense.
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::why not both? used to like turner but he's playing terribly
potato623::Hope Moultrie gets sent back to the D-League
19brom::sixers r pissed they through that lob at the end of the game, calderon went after them appologizing or something afterwords, cant be that soft
19brom::ya thats very true
CoreyGallagherArt::They're stupid and lazy, can't blame the Raps for that, they're not going to let the shot clock run out and get a turnover...
19brom::oops threw*
SpartyOn1220::What was the point of getting Lowry if you are going to use him for 17 minutes a game? Is your coach retarted?
Pandabear023::Kyle Lowry was clearly off his Offensive game tonight. No point in sticking him in there and makign him force it when you have another solid point guard. They usually get equal minutes.
cjax34::It's "$@%!$@%!" not "retarted; but I'll let it go since you're $@%!$@%!.
19brom::derozan plays a solid 2, best player on the team. i would like to see lowry get a few more minuntes and im sure he will
SpartyOn1220::So why not let him play the 2?
19brom::calderons playing better, we have a great winning record when calderon starts, thats why
Ronniep145::No according to the commercials he's our savior
CoreyGallagherArt::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=bcuzguo  Bring home a Philly native
Ronniep145::True but juries our point unless I move Evans to 2 but now were small
CoreyGallagherArt::Obviously Jrue is, Tyreke can play the 1 2 or 3 tho, same as Turner, Turner is the better rebounder, but Tyreke can score better
potato623::Been calling for this all year
CoreyGallagherArt::Are we tanking? I can't tell because everyone looks upset...
Ronniep145::Sucks if we are bc I believe our pick goes to magic or Denver. Not sure
potato623::Thad stormed out and no we suck this bad on our own
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::Jrue and Thad seem like the only definites going forward
Ronniep145::Hard to believe Evan was number two pick in draft
Ronniep145::We could of had Cousins!!  But he's a head case
slickwatts100::wall paul george cousins greg monroe
DENIMCHlCKEN::Wish we took Cousins...
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::hes not even that good dude. good defender, but not O game
slickwatts100::avery bradley?
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::so...four guys?
Ronniep145::Very weak draft
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::True that, but that draft was pretty shallow
slickwatts100::we should trade moses for jeff ruland and have a 30 year big man curse
slickwatts100::so should we let jrue thad and evan grow together or should we break it up and start trading some of them?
DENIMCHlCKEN::Hindsight is 20-20 obviously no one knew Bynum wouldn't play a single game but we were better off keeping Iggy. He would have just had to let Jrue run the offense. Plus, you all know how good a defender he is. Sixers have no D at all this year. Also, look what Lou is doing in Atlanta! Nick Young is supposed to be the guy filling Lou's shoes but thats looking like a HUGE downgrade now.
keezy105::i dont like turner at all. ill keep thad and holiday though. maybe thad not on starting lineup but ill still give him 30 mins a game
potato623::Evan should go unless he starts playing like he was 2 months ago
potato623::I hate Iggy, Jrue would not be able to run the show with him here
slickwatts100::what if we shipped him to denver instead of iggy?
keezy105::id almost prefer this season go to complete $@%!, bynum doesnt play a game and doesnt get a job elsewhere and actually gives us a tryout season at a discount whether its for us or any other team for a big deal. then we have some room for improvements. i dont like collins having complete control of what happens come the draft though...i really just think he needs to go whether its his fault or not.
Ronniep145::Lol
potato623::Big Soft White center who sucked here last year
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::because Collins has a weird thing with playing rookies
slickwatts100::he was nailed to the bench throughout the playoffs
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::well, that's just not true
Ronniep145::Who are we talking about guys
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::Do you mean Big Nik? Because that's nikola vucevic
Ronniep145::I think ur right and some team will give him max deal watch. Not being an $@% but what franchise center did we have that we traded?
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::never said max. i meant bynum when i said max deal
slickwatts100::the guy has a big game against miami and now he's a max guy?
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::no big deal. i think of Big Nik as a franchise center because of how he's playing right now. and no doubt some team will give him the max, but that doesn't mean he'll find the court
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::sadly i think bynums career is over. knee problems like this don't go away. if only we had a franchise center who is healthy and 23...oh wait we did, and we $@%!$@% traded him!
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::yes i do!
potato623::Hope you don't measn Vuc
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::Da.mn we aren't even in ballgames anymore...
philsphan714::Moultrie, Wilkins, Wayns, and Brown shouldn't even be in the NBA
DENIMCHlCKEN::Yeah, Moultrie is no where near ready, who knows if he will ever be. The others are just baaad. Spencer and Allen are bench players at best and would never see the time on the court that they do on a contending team.
potato623::You say Ivey is servacible on D, well ughhh so is Kwame.
keezy105::kwame can play a role at like 1.5 million maybe... moultrie should be in the d-league if they arent even going to give him a shot same with malik
slickwatts100::kwame is a good post defender who can't score a lick. his d gives him value tho
keezy105::he did play dwight howard really well both games he played him
DaKing0325_::shut up, Moultrie and wayns don't even get to play
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::the stats say he averaged 15 minutes per game, but he didn't play at all in most games, and every once in a while he would get a few minutes. He was good in the three minutes he played and Collins still thought Elton Brand should play more than him.
philsphan714::Vucevic averaged 15 minutes a game. Moultrie is at 5. Do I hope he turns into a contributing players, absolutely. But it's not a good sign that he can't even see the floor on a team that has ZERO front court depth and is in a tailspin.
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Just because Collins doesn't play Moultrie doesn't mean he's bad, seeing as Collins clearly isn't the best at judging rookies
philsphan714::PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly - that's not true. look at Big Nik last year. Collins didn't play him at all and now hes a star  Vucevic actually had exactly the same production as he's having this year, just had limited minutes because they had more front court depth. Why they traded him, I'll never know
slickwatts100::wayns played great for us.......up until the pre season ended
philsphan714::he's barely even a fast break guy. He's 100% out of control whenever he gets in the open floor. He had a nice preseason, that's it.
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::that's not true. look at Big Nik last year. Collins didn't play him at all and now hes a star
keezy105::wayns is 100% fastbreak he cant play a half court offense and thats what hes tried to do
philsphan714::DaKing0325_ - shut up, Moultrie and wayns don't even get to play  If they were good, they'd get minutes. People need to stop defending Wayns just cause he's a Philly guy. He's garbage
DaKing0325_::shut up, Moultrie and wayns don't even get to play
potato623::Cause when they play they suck, dude couldn't even play good in the D Leage
ganggreengaingreen_oww::id add nick young and ivey
slickwatts100::how did royal ivey get spared?
philsphan714::Ivey is at least serviceable on defense against guards. Spencer and Allen aren't terrible. They're bench guys who play more than they should, but definitely NBA guys.
ganggreengaingreen_oww::that sick block he had probs
potato623::Hahaha s### :( thought I gotem all haha
potato623::Same with Wright, Allen, and Hawes
slickwatts100::no those 3 belong in the league
slickwatts100::i hoped josh harris would be the new pat croce
potato623::Isn't like they aren't trying, but players are buncha quitters and the trade has just no worked out
potato623::We are worse then the Lakers...sad
slickwatts100::what's sad is the fact the lakers suck period withe all the all stars they got
Ronniep145::Where's the guy that said sixers would cover 10?  These guys give up. For u to think they could cover 10 in the fourth when they clearly gave up and scored only 11 points in third quarter. What the hell were you thinking?
Ronniep145::Can't even get excited about draft bc we gave our pick away
Ronniep145::It's ok man you just believe in them. They let me down time after time. I expect this from them now. Sad huh
ganggreengaingreen_oww::yeah they looked so good in the beginning of the year. we still got the all star break, so if they can win a few games i would be happy. ever since bynum kept putting off his return day you could tell somethin was up here
ganggreengaingreen_oww::i thought doug would be screamin at em for rollin over in the fourth AGAIN, he couldnt possibly watch it happen again could he?
keezy105::another thing im real sick of these collins commercials all over our game as were sucking so badly. hes not our savior at all just stop it.
philsphan714::can't sign quality free agents. Have had 1. ONE. ONE successful draft in the last 6 years. Lack of effort, dumb basketball. the list goes on
slickwatts100::we sign guys after they're beat up and broken down
Aflyne::Now that we have proven we can succeed without Bargnani can we get his #@*! out of town.
Aflyne::Fine give us Millsap!
RainingDimes::He isn't a good fit on the Raptors. He would be perfect on the Jazz though.
Pandabear023::I thought Utah would trade either Millsap or Jefferson or one of their other many front court guys to get a guard. They need guards
ganggreengaingreen_oww::at least villanovas killin it...
potato623::Wish fans would boycott and not even show up next game, but I'm sure 7k will show up
slickwatts100::somewhere iggy is laughing his $@% off
Ronniep145::Nah man him and Holiday would be nice together now. Sucks we traded him. We'd have a better record then now. Sixers never quit when he was here.
potato623::2009 gone from your memmory too haha? We also barely made the playoffs last year
potato623::F### Iggy, he's be here losing with us
cross-checking::what lowsy game...both teams look sluggish
SuperMN215::JRich is so overrated and old i cant believe we have him for 3more years....
KungFuZombie75::JRich isn't here for 3 years, 2 years &amp; I think next year is a player option, agree otherwise
keezy105::obviously was a salary dump to get bynum but yea not sure why it had to happen when we got a 1 year player
ganggreengaingreen_oww::he shoots decent, plays tough D and get some boards, dont see too many other options layin around atm
keezy105::id rather have nick young hes equally bad in every aspect and better at 1 on 1 d and can create offense
ganggreengaingreen_oww::hes the most reliable SG on the team, who else you want taking the shots?
keezy105::plays bad 1 on 1 d and jumps passing lanes and gets steals. not neededto rebound and takes bad shots early in shotclock.
toronto-vigilante3::Didn't like that alley-oop at the end of the game, but Raps got another one.  Good job, boys.
BasketHasMagic::Why not?  Raptors had to shoot or to give em the ball, no chance to end with that possesion
rapfan73::why?
potato623::11 in the 4th...wow  Only 2 shy of lsoing 4 straight by 20
ganggreengaingreen_oww::look at us roll over in the 4th quarter... quitters or bums i cant decide
big18brad::BARGNANI IS A JOKE
BasketHasMagic::At least jokes are fun Barg isn't
picaac15::WE DID LOSE BY 20!!!!    YESSSSSSS
FunkVolumeOF::Great game raptors. Go pacers !
douchewein8::give us amir johnson!! we'lll give you spence, nick, dorrell, and wayns..
dipset73::No deal.amir stays.
DaKing0325_::Thad just walked off the floor while there was still time, he looked pissed
potato623::Only player trying
SuperMN215::he should be pissed 3-4inches taller and he be a NBA superstar
keezy105::thad is a great energy player hes not a starting 4 youre right but stop.
