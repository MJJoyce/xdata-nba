Austin::As a Spurs fan I'm glad Dejuan Blair is getting some meaningful playing time. San Antonio fans loved him during his tenure with the Spurs because he was a fun player to watch and always gave it 110%. But when the Spurs added Boris Diaw to the roster, Blair just got buried on the depth chart. Dejuan is an extremely good rebounder, but Diaw is just an all around player with no weaknesses and an improvement from Dejuan.  Overall it worked out for both the Spurs and Dejuan Blair, but as a Spurs fan, seeing Blair in a Mavs Uniform will take some getting used to, but I imagine it isnt much different than Michael Finley coming to SA a few years back.
Dan::Big win for the Wolves!

Mark::Last year, the Wolves were still looking for their 3rd win I believe , this year I think they won eight or nine, thats called improvement,baring injuries of course, they have to keep this pace,,,no ones going to let you win,, 1 and four in the last five games,,,,hope this win is   the start of something good,,,
ric::these teams both suck a doink
