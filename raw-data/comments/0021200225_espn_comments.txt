5-O 49ers::<b><a>more proof that all the prissiness and drama inflicted by Rondo's antics are not worth it to the Celtics organization.  They should just cut their losses, trade him for a 2nd Rd draft pick and move on.  </a></b>
spurs fans suck::if damian was more consistent, he should be the clear cut favorite to be roy
oreed is a angry redsox fan::by calling the celtics (SOFT) I THINK DOC  AWAKING A SLEEPING GIANT...this celtics team are too  good....
CBass1317::No rebounders or interior D.  Blazers are just terrible.  You are mistaking how bad the Blazers are with the quality of the Celtics.
bennnnnba::the celtics are about as good as your grammar.
Excelscior1::LOL
abovethelies2::The C's would be great IF the played Portland every night BUT they don't.  Therefore this W hardly qualified as "awaking a sleeping giant". C's at best are a 43 win team which does put them in the playoffs because they play in the weak East Conference..
oblique15::yeah the east that won the title!!! Heat are in the East and the best competion for them last year was the Celtics. The Heat ate the Thunder like a snack.
TigerPawRaw::Is Chris Forsberg a man or a woman? I was looking at his pic and found I really could not tell. He has that "Pat" effect going on (if you're a 90's baby, nevermind).
nh743::LOL! Yeah it does kind of have that lesbian/could be man/woman type look to it

_I Am A Celtic_::C's!
henrybaboy::Good win for the celtics today without Rondo. Good to see Jeff Green finally have a good game, maybe he's getting his confidence back. 5 turnovers for Pierce, way too many.
Nebula29x::Green &gt; Pierce
KCRoyalsChiefsKings::Blazers are terrible.
durantfolife35::Rondo didnt play tonight? STERN! I Paid to watch him play!
vandeman34::Stern should fine Celts
Excelscior1::You mean Stern should fine himself [the league]?
Fear the Gr0nk::Lillard: 8 points 3 rebounds 3 assists 3 turnovers.  I was expecting better.
willy9922::hi
tomBabauts::used to like KG. Now he's just a grumpy old man.
Kobelies247::-The Blazers starters did not record any points in fourth quarter. Only Meyers Leonard, Luke Babbitt, Joel Freeland and Will Barton scored.  -The Blazers finished the game shooting only 34.8% (24-69) from the field and a paltry 20% (3-15) from three-point range. -Will Barton played only 17 minutes, but led the team in assists with 4. -The Celtics finished with five players scoring in double digits (Jeff Green - 19, Jason Terry - 17, Paul Pierce - 12, Courtney Lee/Kevin Garnett - 10) compared to three for the Blazers (LaMarcus Aldridge - 23, J.J. Hickson/Meyers Leonard - 11)
