Cyril::It's amazing how much Jennings and Smith use the ball in this offense.   Combined - 35 shot attempts, 20 assists, and 10 turnovers.  That's 65 possessions before you add in their free-throw attempts!    However, they missed 24 of those shots, and when you add in the 10 turnovers, that means the two of them WASTED 34 of the team's possessions.   Jennings and Smith - 34 bad possessions Rest of team combined - 28 bad possessions (22 missed shots and 6 turnovers)  When the Pistons lose, it's always the same story: Smith and/or Jennings dominated the ball, took bad shots, and committed a bunch of turnovers.  They're talented players with low basketball IQ's.    The only way a team can truly be successful with Smith is if they play him at power forward and limit his shot attempts. The only way any team is going to be successful with Jennings is if they can teach him the difference between good shots and bad shots, and that hasn't happened yet.
Chris::The Wizards bench stepped up for once - not great stat-lines, but a strong +/-. Normally they're on the other side of that line.
Crofton MD::I realize the East stinks but I believe come April the Wizards will have the 3rd best record in the conference.
donald::I am Josh Smith and if I feel like missing 13 out of 19 shots, there's nothing you can do about it.  I got paid already.
George::Brandon Jennings the most Talented Dumb person EVER!
Tony Anthony::Great win. The Wizards' bench had their best performance of the season, Nene played great D in the 4th on Josh Smith, Ariza was great on D all game, and Wall & Beal hit some clutch baskets! If the Wizards keep up this level of play (won 5 out of their last 6), then the 3rd seed is not impossible with Horford out for the year.
Amir::First season game where Wizards bench is doing great.
Mi::Wall over 21,5 points ?
Commenter::Ahahahhah.  pistones choking this one away as predicted!!
Commenter::Pistones will LOSE THIS GAME.  BOOK IT!!!
