rslgiant::Jazz are not out of this yet.  Just win baby!
50 Free Throws::Utah should file a law suit and make David Stern explain 50 free throws to a jury.
GoTmJazz52::The Jazz haven't earn that 8 spot yet, and still a fight with the Lakers and remain in getting that 8 spot by winning over the Warriors late last night. Jazz have to suck it up, in focusing winning their last two road games against the T-Wolves, and Grizzlies.
No-account drifter::Oh, snap Stern. Bet you wish you'd called off your Laker-fan refs and let the Jazz earn the 8th seed now.
millem365::T-Pups &gt; Lakers next yeear???
doggbrown1::bricky rubio
Shelton2622::Rubio played well last night.
R Barron::I have been frustrated as much as anyone with Millsap and Jefferson this season. Even still, I was pretty sad watching them on the home court for the last time.
BostonSportsaretheGreatest2011::it's not over yet...idiot
scow79::Jerry Zgoda is killing it on this Kobe Bryant story while Bill Oram seems to have fallen asleep.
oczonie::OK Jazz!  The Basketball Gods have continued to give you break after break after break.  Now can you man up and win the rest of these games?
rbmw263::Lakers done next season too. Dwight definitely not coming back now.
scow79::Don't they owe next seasons draft pick to Phoenix as well?
TheKanterManKan::Nahh, you can't trade back to back 1st rounders
rbmw263::not sure
Mike Honcho Spread::Kobe is out for good. Sounded like he doesn't even want to try to come back
rbmw263::He wouldnt be able to come back for AT LEAST a year. So honestly he would be out all next year.  He had one good yr left in his legs WITHOUT a torn achilles
its_complicated::Even if Kobe tore his Achilles, I'm sure the refs will still find a way to get the Lakers into the playoffs.  But if my Jazz can win the next two games, it doesn't even matter!
No-account drifter::Here's hoping the Spurs can help you out on Sunday.
Fastfox1306::The key game is the Minnesota game...they win that, there is no way they lose at Memphis if the playoffs are on the line. But if the Lakers keep winning, it is a moot point.
Fastfox1306::I don't care if Jefferson scores 60 points...watching him just stand around on defense is infuriating! He refuses to do anything on defense! I really hope he is in a different uniform next year.
Fastfox1306::I don't care if he wants to resign for 8 million...he will hinder Favors, Kanter, Hayward and Burks. The jazz need to star over with them and re-tool the offense and defense geared toward them. Competing starts with defense. Those 4 guys on the floor at the same time would be an amazing defensive team. Offensively they could be potent too! Problem is the jazz have no PG.
scow79::I think most Jazz fans want this, I know I do, but you have to give the man his props tonight at least.   40 points on 27 shots, 13 rebounds and 6 assists is a hell of a game.
scow79::This is why I wish the Jazz could bring him back for around 10M per and bring him in off the bench.    He thoroughly abuses second tier bigs.  I know it would never happen, but it would be great if it did.
LeBron James GOAT 23::KOBE TORN ACHILLES. KARMA IS THE B.ITCH. THAT'S WHAT STERN GETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KOBE TORN ACHILLES. KARMA IS THE B.ITCH. THAT'S WHAT STERN GETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KOBE TORN ACHILLES. KARMA IS THE B.ITCH. THAT'S WHAT STERN GETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KOBE TORN ACHILLES. KARMA IS THE B.ITCH. THAT'S WHAT STERN GETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KOBE TORN ACHILLES. KARMA IS THE B.ITCH. THAT'S WHAT STERN GETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KOBE TORN ACHILLES. KARMA IS THE B.ITCH. THAT'S WHAT STERN GETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TheKanterManKan::Makr Jackson lost this game. Why would you run a pick n roll with Landry instead of Lee? Landry should never have touched the ball on that play
scow79::Because Mark Jackson isn't a good coach.
TheKanterManKan::It's like when Al took that 3 pointer against Sac Corbin: 'It was a good shot'
scow79::Kobe with a tear to his achilles.   Looks like the Jazz are backing into the playoffs again this year.
rbmw263::They have played fine, and possibly even better w/o him. Its not over yet
No-account drifter::Most NBA fans know the Lakers would only have beaten you because Stern's refs have been on the job for the Lakers since at least February. Sure, ESPN and Laker fans will say otherwise. Everybody else will know the score.
scow79::I know.   If we get in now though, it's going to be said that it's because of injuries, not because the team earned it.
Mike Honcho Spread::Don't worry too much jazz fans, early reports from lakers fear a torn achilles for kobe
rbmw263::Curry runs into a moving Howard screen. For some reason Blake shoots the free throws.
rbmw263::Lakers shot more FT's tonight than Utah has in the last 4 games. Im sure its a coincidence.
Francis4345::Try watching what ? You call this a game ????? Everybody except Lakers fans know that was writen in the book, by any ways, Lakers win that game by any help possible. Hey, more than triple of GS FT's ! Must be blind, are you?
ChrisTodd01::Shut up, Dwight got hacked a ton and had 22 by himself. Ignorant moron. Try watching the game next time.
rbmw263::http://espn.go.com/nba/shotchart?gameId=400278909
Mike Honcho Spread::Don't worry jazz fans, they were on the Mavs board the other night. Just make sure you are on the LA boards when they get swept first round
MambaBamba78::YEAH GO MENTION 2002 ONE MORE TIME. GUESS DA MAMBA WILL KEEP ON CUMULATING RINGS
TheKanterManKan::You get a ring for making the 8 spot then getting swept?
Francis4345::In Wheelchair ?
Mike Honcho Spread::and you will keep slurpin the cumulation
rbmw263::If i were the Millers I would sue the NBA and show this game tape in court. Theres a lot of money on the line here...
rbmw263::So little contact called on one end and so much contact let go on the other. Blatant.
Andrew The Kingpin Bynum::It'd be nice to go a game without seeing one of our players sustain an injury. Losing Kobe would kill whatever chances we still have.
Mike Honcho Spread::i will take a realist fan over some idiot who just says "16 you mad?" to everything
10soccerfan10::Lakers have no f'n chance.
mikeisildur::FIFTY free throws.  For a 2 point win.  This is outrageous.  I'm seriously considering just not watching the NBA anymore.
free derrick favors::I'm retiring from the boards. This is my last post and I'm not even watching the nba for the rest of this season. Time to start looking forward to football.
LeafsplzsweeptheRags_GODEVILZZZ::Awesome year Wolves ...  glad I stopped watching long ago as I couldn't take it anymore  WOW ! Nice shooting Poopio and as for Love gratz on the surgery and being out more.   Oh and how is D-Will again ?  We draft this guy who doesn't have a position he can truly play.  Nice going Minny !
10soccerfan10::The refs just GAVE the lakers the game.  What $@%!$@%!.  WWE is more real than this crap!!!!!  GO WARRIORS
Sports-Talk-Now-::wahhhhhhhh
Mike Honcho Spread::thought steph was gunna hit that. I hate using the word. but that woulda been epic lol
Francis4345::Fault on Blake was a phantom call... wow
free derrick favors::I'm done with this $@%!. This aint even a conspiracy it's been so obvious the last 10 games
Francis4345::Possible. Kobe is falling apart
TheKanterManKan::I'm not. LA will still lose to SA/houston
Mike Honcho Spread::yeah you must be like 15
Sports-Talk-Now-::Mike Honcho Spread - truth  fail again
Mike Honcho Spread::truth
Sports-Talk-Now-::fail
btopps751::50 to 16. At least make it not as noticeable Stern.
bronbron80::all them heat fans scared of lakers reaching the finals
10soccerfan10::Lakers will exit first round.
Sports-Talk-Now-::your team kid
JWalk9267::If I were a heat fan I'd love to see the fakers in the finals. Easiest ring ever.
Mike Honcho Spread::not at all, 16 means absolutely nothing to me. only seems to matter to laker "fans"
Sports-Talk-Now-::Mike Honcho Spread - Were you a fan for all 16, were you even alive for more than 5?   16 b itch you mad
Mike Honcho Spread::Were you a fan for all 16, were you even alive for more than 5?
Sports-Talk-Now-::fakers stupid its Lakers b itch 16 rings your team
btopps751::No Stern will only help the Lakers until they reach the Finals, then its fair game.
rbmw263::fu.cking gifted a win. Bull sh.it
rbmw263::most garbage fu.cking refs ive ever seen in my life
10soccerfan10::How does Blake get the 2 shots?
TheKanterManKan::That was a corbin style play drawn up there. Landry from just inside the 3 point line? WTF?
bronbron80::yup lakers win. phew
btopps751::48 FTs to 16....never in my life.
bronbron80::lakers got this
TheKanterManKan::Curry better take this shot
btopps751::Jazz fans, did you really think Stern would let you in the playoffs before the Lakers?
jahlove1261::Sorry Utah but somebody upstairs (STern) wants the Lakers to be the 8th seed.
rbmw263::OMG Lakers get bumped and they are at the line. This is the most rigged bull sh.it game ive ever seen. La/Sacto style
JWalk9267::48 free throws and counting
MambaBamba78::MAMMMBBAAAAAA &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JAZZ
