dichdastardly::tah tah tah ath... On The Clips come into town
dichdastardly::When the Tics beat the Clippers... what will the Rondonians say then... oh yeah..  the Clippers aren't really a good team
dichdastardly::excuses above..
jahlove1261::Toronto just ran them out of the gym by 25 - without Paul, the Clips are mediocre at best.
dichdastardly::Slam Bam thank you Orlando
Barrk_40::Back at .500 $@%!$@%!
terryjt1::Jeff Green for Dunk Contest anybody?
Fear the Wade::Jeff Green with #2 and #4 sportscenter top plays.   I picked a terrible game to miss I guess.
Fear the Wade::Pierce has been playing great the past few games.
Kirk-ls-My-Hinrich::Easier for Pierce in the half court.  More spacing, defenders can't help off of Rondo.  Pierce put up good #'s when Rondo was out early last season too.

UK_Basketball_for_Life_RondoTripleDoubleEdition::Rajon
abdiraxman79::rondoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
abdiraxman79::just saw both of jeff greens dunks, when you let a guy waltz into the lane and just throw it down dirty, twice, with zero resistance, that's a team that either doesn't have solid leadership, or really doesn't like playing together. i actually felt bad for the magic because some of their bench players gave the "glad that wasn't me"  look to the players on the court.
Justin00247::go celtics we are on a roll up next the clippers

Red Wings-Celtics-Phins-Tigers::nah
KevinHate::Magic fans, out of curiosity... are you glad to be rid of Howard?
MagicNoles09::As a true fan, im happier watching this years' team more than the past two seasons. I'm very hopeful as to what we'll draft and trade to make us contenders in 2-3 years. So yea, farewell Dwight (ya could have been huge with us).
Roll to 15::they probably are haha.
aussie_rondo::i would be...sook
Roll to 15::yeah, they probably where tired of him talking about leaving.
Roll to 15::we out scored the Magic every quarter except the 4th and we tied them in that Quarter.
TexasLonghorns247::rondo!

aussie_rondo::australian football &gt; american football  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIReSJhQor0
TexasLonghorns247::weren't we up by like 20? Was it really more of a blowout and they just made it look not too bad in the final minutes?
Roll to 15::oh, yeah they made it look close.
Roll to 15::yeah 19. close.
jagrmiester777::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGTLJcCi_wk
Roll to 15::yeah, he has cool dunks.
TexasLonghorns247::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uy1L6cqj4Y
Roll to 15::that was a AWESOME!!! Dunk!!
TexasLonghorns247::I heard Jeff put vucevic on a poster?
Roll to 15::SC top 10!!!
That_Dude_Dre::another one added to the list
paulleena12::Good Night All.  Not sure what to make of this Celtic team.  Clippers game might be a good measuring stick.
Roll to 15::yep.
Roll to 15::Night hope Boston wins vs the Clippers.
paulleena12::Me too.  That would be nice after the beating we took in that west coast trip.
TexasLonghorns247::argh!
Roll to 15::okay, Gotcha.
Roll to 15::what happened man?
TexasLonghorns247::nothing just thought I'd let people know I'm back.
aussie_rondo::australian football &gt; american football
Roll to 15::Nope.
aussie_rondo::anyone seen the aussie game?
paulleena12::I have.  Stayed in Melbourne for 4 years.
Roll to 15::American Football is better.
TexasLonghorns247::Pats &gt;
-DMotheJETT::WHOOOOOOOA!!!!!!!!! STOP RIGHT THERE
Sportfan71::Promising rookie like Sully lost for the season! That sucks!!!
Roll to 15::yep.
TexasLonghorns247::I'm thirsty! be right back
Roll to 15::gotacha! ;)
TexasLonghorns247::DMo = GOAT tennis player :-P
-DMotheJETT::&gt;.&lt; lol
Roll to 15::I don't think Boston, should make a Trade it would be bad timing hurt Chemistry just everything needs to wait Boston can make a small deal but nothing that has Rondo Pierce or KG in it.
-DMotheJETT::DT!!!!!!!!!!!
Roll to 15::yes sir they did!
Roll to 15::whats up man!
-DMotheJETT::CELTICS WON WOOOOO!!!!!!
Roll to 15::hey DMotheJETT!!!
-DMotheJETT::whats up!
TexasLonghorns247::DMO!!!!!!!!
-DMotheJETT::whats up! :)
paulleena12::Green:  "I don't want [Celtics coach] Doc [Rivers] yelling at me."  Instead of celebrating after his dunk, his thought is to get back on defense.  Green got an earful from Rivers on Wednesday night for not being aggressive enough with a mismatch.
TexasLonghorns247::Fab was a waste of a pick.
jagrmiester777::I watched his freshman year at Cuse, looked really raw...he looked like a new player his 2nd year...if he keeps approving like that he will be a great center...great shotblocker and rebounder...and he can throw it down hard and hit the J
Roll to 15::yeah, I agree with wonderboycpnt he did only have three Minutes of play.
wonderboycpnt::Give him time dude, he played 3 minutes of garbage time tonight. No doubt that he's a project, but if he pans out he could be sweet. Right now he's Patrick O'Bryant.
That_Dude_Dre::We should have got Perry Jones III
Roll to 15::No, I don't think he was we need a Rebounder it takes time man.
aussie_rondo::sully?
TexasLonghorns247::that's the problem. he can't rebound!
UK_Basketball_for_Life_RondoTripleDoubleEdition::I bow down to this Jag fool. He's a great Celtic fan who knows the ins and outs of the game while I just troll on the skirts of the bandwagon.
TexasLonghorns247::Yeah same here. I guess I should start watching Celtics games because apparently KG does more in 30 minutes than LeBron does in an entire game.
jagrmiester777::you all must be like 16...your one of those "kids" who grew up watching kobe and think you have to score 30pts a game to be a great player...even tho there shooting 40%....If Kg was hurt instead of rondo the Celtics would have 12 wins this year
paulleena12::Sully's news was tough to take.
wonderboycpnt::Back injuries always suck. LJ was never the same after he got cut on, Dwight doesn't look like the same guy. Sullinger didn't have that much to lose as he isn't that athletic anyway, so hopefully this doesn't affect him long-term.
wonderboycpnt::Think the coaches want a redo on their vote yet? Deng, Lopez, and George get in over Paul, GTFO.
wonderboycpnt::Rarified air in being an 11-time All-Star, just wish he got the credit and respect that he deserves for being a true baller.
aussie_rondo::definetly pierce&gt;deng....george vs pierce close
paulleena12::Pierce can rest up.  Might be blessing in disguise.
That_Dude_Dre::Well Paul George deserved it
TexasLonghorns247::So Fab sucked in his 3 minutes? Go figure... I told people he's not going to be ready for another 5 years.
That_Dude_Dre::By that point he's just Athletic Steamer
TexasLonghorns247::because he can do anything productive on the offensive end and on the defensive end his shot blocking is the only thing he has.
jagrmiester777::why a waste???
TexasLonghorns247::Fab was a waste of a pick. No need to see him play in the NBA. I say trade him while he has any value.
Roll to 15::he played three Minutes longhorn.
paulleena12::I don't think Danny Ainge will do a big trade, he might do something small.
aussie_rondo::please not another guard...
TexasLonghorns247::DMo!
UK_Basketball_for_Life_RondoTripleDoubleEdition::Timmy D and KG are two of the best of all time. But both would benefit by having Rondo on their team today.
jagrmiester777::haha shut up about rondo
-DMotheJETT::CELTICS!!!!!!!!!!
paulleena12::Where have you been?
TexasLonghorns247::I see Fab recorded his first NBA stat.
Roll to 15::it was a Steal.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_RondoTripleDoubleEdition::Was it a TO?
TexasLonghorns247::believe it or not the exact opposite, a steal!
That_Dude_Dre::He looked lost and made Kyle Quin look great
paulleena12::Of the Current Celtics players, KG is my favourite.
paulleena12::I love how he mentors all the young guys too and gives them all the ins and outs of plays he has picked up over the years.
Roll to 15::yeah, I like KG his Motive to keep on going I also like Rondo he is unselfish and Pierce is just simply a Leader.
That_Dude_Dre::Rondo,Ab,Pierce,KG
TexasLonghorns247::Rondo/KG/Pierce for me.
That_Dude_Dre::KG probably the best Point forward to play the game
TexasLonghorns247::So is Tim Duncan not just a center who was playing by David Robinson?
UK_Basketball_for_Life_RondoTripleDoubleEdition::NO
jagrmiester777::u clearly didn't watch robinson before Duncan...
UK_Basketball_for_Life_RondoTripleDoubleEdition::He didn't make his name playing next to David. He made Robinson better.
TexasLonghorns247::no he is not a center or no he is a center?
wonderboycpnt::It's an insult that Paul Pierce isn't an All-Star, and that Paul George and Luol Deng are. SMFH.
Roll to 15::oh yeah it is.
