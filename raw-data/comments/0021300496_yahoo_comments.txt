Tony::I checked C.J. McCollum stats from the Idaho Stampede game tonight, his first game back, he will rejoin the Blazers next week. In 17 minutes he scored 13, 6 assists, 6 rebounds, and 2 steals. This guy by the end of the season will be a key player in the playoff run, if his foot stays healthy. I played college ball so know a good deal about it and knew Lillard would be the best pick of last year, I think C.J. will rank in the top 3 overall by season's end. This is a young team with some veteran leadership, it's being built to contend for a championship within 3 years. I have high hopes for them. I think ultimately they will be better and deeper than the 90's Blazers.
Tony::The one bad thing about jump shooting teams, when a couple players are off from 3 point land, it is contagious, likewise when they make it like the other night. Portland will rebound strong from this. When they lose it's only by a couple of points usually decided in the last second. I am curious how McCollum did for the Stampede in his first game back.
Travis J::I said it once, I'll say it again Portland's not a legit title contender! At least not this year...
Joe::Team basketball is leading the dominant Western Conference without having a player leading the all star votes.  Go Blazers
Trace Mann::Portland Trailblazers get no Love from the media, Yet lead the Western Conference in wins?
CSONKA_39::Portland has been healthy pretty much all year...Don't mean to jinx them or anything...
Poot::wheeeweee 134 points in their last game and Trail Blazers are on fire !
Nathan::Lillard is lousy in this game. 6 for 20, 2 reb,1 ast, 6TOs. What a PG !!
Faranak::I can not believe Lillard missed the layup.
Anton::Lillard 1 assist 6 turnovers...yeah.
