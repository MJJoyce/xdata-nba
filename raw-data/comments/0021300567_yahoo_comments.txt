Commenter::Did not see the game - was MKG manning up on Turner?
cjk::Heres a concept... Put Zeller in to crash the boards!!
scott::Ever since Iguadala was traded this 76er team has sucked.
PKM::I'm guessing Bobcats find a way to get this one.
Dave H::Bobcats need to crash the boards!, team rebound the ball. Hope Jordan is looking for some help for Big Al in the paint.  Go Bobcats !
