indiggohaze::LOL heat suck
pdiddy0622::This game will be the last time Knicks beat the heat this season.
TheSixthHeatle::4701 days since the Knicks won a playoff series, maybe this year is the year.
IllinisStudent6847::Melo's only going off because Joe Johnson's not playing.  --Heat fans
Rob_Gronkkkkkkk::Lol wtf is this
pdiddy0622::Joe Johnson doesn't play for the Heat, u idiot! - Heat fans
heatonomics::I think Kenyon Martin is making a strong case that the Heat should have let him try out for their team. Don't get me wrong, I think Birdman is a great addition, but I didn't realize that he was so offensively challenged until I saw  that particular play where he was fouled and instead of trying to make the shot, he tries to pass the ball.
koke003::Hey
Rob_Gronkkkkkkk::Hey
Onyxmav::Hey
brandonlee561heat22::hay
brandonlee561heat22::Damn they put Shaqs jersey up in the rafters backwards lol
chanchoso::http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/shaquille-o-neal-retired-lakers-jersey-backward-seems-200003895--nba.html
Onyxmav::Yeah I don't know what that was about
brandonlee561heat22::Aboslutely, but how the heck could really print his name on the front of the jersey, so funny
Onyxmav::Great moment for Shaq though
chanchoso::yeah, i didn't get that
koke003::Anibal bout to get a no hitter
25pollo86::Oh aight
25pollo86::Against who
koke003::Twins
brandonlee561heat22::That would be awesome You saw Darvish last night?
brandonlee561heat22::No idea, he has a career ERA of 4.6 though
koke003::Who the hell is Slowey lol
brandonlee561heat22::I guess so, since Eovaldi is done for a couple weeks. I hate this teams ownership
koke003::Btw, is Sanabia part of the Marlins rotation?
brandonlee561heat22::One hitter away, so craazy
koke003::Didn't see it but heard about it, that sucked
kobe being kobe in colorado::The caves owner refers to his players as expensive slaves. Smh
25pollo86::Remember in the 90's Knicks used dominate heat back when we had a.houston p.ewing l.johnson l.spreewell even in the Starks n d.harper days ..well those days r coming back .. Go knickerbokers .. Oh we even beat y'all down in fighting .. Haha
jimmo1301::congrats ny big win LOL
25pollo86::Well we making  history this yr
25pollo86::Hell na we even beat the heat 1st rd in 99 when Ewing got injured Knicks were 8seed that yr n made 2the finals .. Heat used to get beat a lot by the Knicks in playoffs in 90's
Zundweebi::Remember when the Spaniard beat all the gladiators in 1500BC?
chanchoso::Yes, well deserved wins (8th seed going to Finals is awesome), but they simply couldn't finish the job...
Calvin9299::Ancient history though. Just saying !
Calvin9299::Its been a long time since the Knicks made that kind of noise.  Ill be rooting for them, but I'm careful about predictions since its best to do the talking after they succeed, not prior to. :)
chanchoso::Yeah, and that bunch never managed to win a ring...
chanchoso::2 windows for the Knicks to win ONE and they couldn't do it
Zundweebi::I just remember the Knicks getting bounced in the first round every year. So long ago, recent memory is most memorable.  Go on that.
DanNY24621810::i guess you don't have a very good memory, or (more likely) you aren't old enough to remember
chanchoso::Lebron's a coward for leaving the Cavs. And so is CP3, and Kobe, and Shaq, and Dwight, and Drexler, and Malone, and, and, and.... all cowards right?
Zundweebi::Oh yea a free agent deciding where he wants to go.  He must be the first one ever to do that.
Calvin9299::Besides.... How does it make anyone a coward ?  Wrong word obviously.  These guys want to play for winners, whether we think he's right or wrong.  Perhaps your beef should center around the system that allows players to do that.
kobe being kobe in colorado::Your an idiot, right?
chanchoso::Wraggy??
Swade_ND_Shade::95% of people from Cleveland have never even been out of the city themselves so of course they expect Lebron to stay for life. They didn't even like when he was playing away games for the Cav's.
Rio FERDINAND owns everything::Kobe?
chanchoso::Yes, Kobe refused to play for the Hornets that drafted him. Coward too!
DanNY24621810::no,  i don't care that he left
Calvin9299::The whole thing was a ridiculous circus. Its not departing Cleveland that's the issue, its how....  Leaving a team he single handedly carried and played it out was by no means wrong.
GaspoMinnyFan981::Lag?
WOODY.3435656::hisss
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::The only way to really beat Miami is to punk them.
Swade_ND_Shade::The only way to beat Miami is to kidnap Lebron and Wade.
fsosa02::or if we rest our entire lineup.  we only win 50% of those games
Swade_ND_Shade::Everytime the camera man panned over to the Miami bench, Lebron and Wade were practically falling asleep. No one is scared of the Knicks. The Knicks are considered a first round bye.
im_still_blk::The celtics will lose in 5??? O_O Someone help this man!
DanNY24621810::the knicks will be saying "bye" to the celtics after destroying them in the first round
DanNY24621810::i agree, the celtics will lose in 5
Swade_ND_Shade::Celtics in 5.
brandonlee561heat22::haha http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkwP0TlhN3g
Rio FERDINAND owns everything::BAAAANG!!!!!!!!
koke003::Brandon you saw the Marlins game on Monday?
brandonlee561heat22::Yep, just the first couple of innings lol It was pretty much over after the first I guess
brandonlee561heat22::I might for a bit, they $@%! me off lol Same with the Panthers
koke003::Lol, you gonna be on the Marlins board tonight?
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::Miami will not beat us 4 times this season.
Barona41::Ok 5 times, but I'm being nice
fsosa02::didnt u read my previous post?
fsosa02::i guess we will see
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::I liked it, but it's not true.
Aicyla22::have a good night everyone
cbbaseball19::One love!
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::Get a boyfriend, i don't see why you talk to these dudes here who get off to your words.
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::Was it that deep?
Aicyla22::thanks Dr Phil
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::So what team do you think Lebron will choose in 2014?  Chicago or back to cleveland?  He can take a huge paycut and play with Irving Waiters and hopefully real big men if they draft some.
Calvin9299::Why not stay in Miami ?
I was trying to think of a clever username but i failed::i'm out like the fat kid in dodgeball
Aicyla22::bye sir
brandonlee561heat22::*catches ball, get's Duro back into game
King Taint::1
King Taint::alycia do you have 1 night stands?
Aicyla22::nope
King Taint::good girl
cbbaseball19::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Diy0RNe_c
Rio FERDINAND owns everything::1st  round-NY BOS 4 2 2nd round-NY INDI 4 1 3rd round-NY HEAT ? ?
Calvin9299::Rio Noticed the question marks !!!!!! Says quite a bit doesn't it.  I hope I'm wrong but I really believe Miami can coast with a few blips, but go to the finals easily.
fsosa02::heat win 2-0, the blowouts were so outrageous they cancelled the remainder of the playoff series to minimize humility
fsosa02::it was funny right
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::I like it.
WOODY.3435656::4-1 to heat  heat rest lebron wade 1st game
Barona41::4 and 1 against the pacers? Not likely.
Barona41::NY 0 Heat 4
Swade_ND_Shade::NY -1 HEAT 4
koke003::Hai guyz :)
brandonlee561heat22::Sup
King Taint::hi
Barona41::Losing in the First Round of the Playoffs  - Knicks Philosophy
DanNY24621810::we lost the eventual champions, in the only series they were fully healthy. This year we'll be playing an even older Celtics team without their best player
Calvin9299::Have to agree... There's reason to believe the Knicks can go deep.
I was trying to think of a clever username but i failed::you guyz are ryke my famiry :)
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::Get a life, just because you typed in a stupid way doesn't mean that's not how you feel.
King Taint::does that mean i get to meat your sister?
King Taint::we are familyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Calvin9299::This was a game minus three major starters. For Miami it means absolutely nothing. They can use the remaining games to rest and get healthy.   Come playoff time Miami will be the big favorites, but the Knicks can make it very interesting. They are one of only a few teams with winning records vs the Heat.
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::the first two 20+ blowouts dont mean anything?  Or Melo dropping 50 on that swiss cheese defense
Calvin9299::I'm a Knicks fan actually for what its worth.  Come playoff time its a whole new ball game. The Heat are still the better team but the Knicks have had success against them.
brandonlee561heat22::Miami should have won, now the magic number to clinch the #1 overall seed is 5 again
Zundweebi::The same delusional fans that thought Lin would take the Heat.   You can't argue with them but give them credit for their hope and conviction.
Zundweebi::He also knew to not play in the playoffs revealing his true worth.  Brilliant!
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::um lin fans are not knicks fans. they were banwagon chinatowners who never watched a basketball game before last year.   Knick fans clearly had a civil war with lin fans
WOODY.3435656::no wonder lin left the knicks
DanNY24621810::doesn't take a harvard degree to know which team is offering more money
Zundweebi::Leave it to a kid from an ivy league school to have sense.
DanNY24621810::we're doing just fine without him
Barona41::5-1 against the knicks last year, key words IN THE PLAYOFFS  - Heat's Philosophy
WOODY.3435656::well playoffs do matter more dont they?
DanNY24621810::you can't win 5 games in a series
King Taint::alycia's kitty likes it doggystyle
WOODY.3435656::sure we gave 20 pt lead away at MSG but we still better than heat  - knicks philosophy
25pollo86::16 but only gm y'all got Knicks3-1
Swade_ND_Shade::If Knicks are the better team, why are they NINE GAMES behind Miami. You beat Miami the other night without Lebron and Wade and you barely won with Melo's rare 50 point game. Come playoff time, i hope to see you in this board when the Knicks get a first round exit like always.
DanNY24621810::to the celtics? don't be silly
DanNY24621810::Pretty sure it was only a 14 point lead
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::woody put out our C team lol. Novak was the center at one point. Those scrubs down in miami think they have a team
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::Sure we were blown out twice to the knicks but we werent trying hard  -HEat fans
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::3-1
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::Its clear that the Knicks are the better matchup vs the heat.   Heat are better overall but vs the Knicks you have to give the W in 7 game series to the team that rebounds, actually has a bench, and has the interior defense to make DWade and Lebron throw up bricks instead of flopping to the line.  Having said that the refs are a big factor as Miami has a huge disparity in FTs
jdot3mpny::if melo had been rightfully been given several missed foul calls we couldve seen 60
Zundweebi::Pacers, Celtics.    Knicks need to pray they can rain threes in a 7 game series. Good luck with that
brandonlee561heat22::Seems wrong.
WOODY.3435656::dont push your luck. you was saying the same thing probably last year too
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::no last year the knicks were awful. Although Indiana clearly had you beat until frustration from the refs got to them
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::Seriously how many of you were or are T'wolves fans in here? Besides gaspo of course.
GaspoMinnyFan981::Hisssssss
I was trying to think of a clever username but i failed::who's bothering gaspo? i'll eat em
Aicyla22:::)
GaspoMinnyFan981::Except Alcyia
cbbaseball19::I did not do anything to Gaspo.
Aicyla22::hey! i was nice to you
GaspoMinnyFan981::Everyone
Aicyla22::cb
Barona41::Sure melo can score 50, but we'll still win the playoff match 5-1  - Heat Philosophy
Aicyla22::whats so unreasonable about that?
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::"There are 32 teams in the NBA."  -Actual Heat fan quote
WOODY.3435656::let knicks fans have their moment. they wont have any in the playoffs.
25pollo86::Watch out 4knicks in playoffs
DanNY24621810::please, boston is done, the knicks will beat them in 5
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::I just can feel a little bit of energy from Minny fans in here, all of these bandwagoners act like Minny fans.
cbbaseball19::Fellow canines, Alycia sided with a feline just a few moments ago.  I say we banish her!
King Taint::we should punish her with our p.enises
Aicyla22::that was a rhetorical ? mark
King Taint::we should bang you violently
Aicyla22::?
Aicyla22::you mad?
cbbaseball19::Definitely!
WOODY.3435656::melo will never win a ring  -fact
LebronJames2015MVP::It is funny how all you NBA experts on this board are the only ones talking about the refs... You would think that at least one person in the emitter country that actually covers the NBA would mention anything about the refs....
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::Lebron has yet to win a ring  -Real NBA fans  They were given the Indiana series by the refs
chanchoso::Blaming refs is way lame. True NBA fans know refs don't "give" a 7-game series away. In a 7 game series, the best team wins, period. When the Heat lost to the Mavs in the Finals, no one blmaed the refs. When the Heat beat the Mavs and Thunder, people said the refs gave it to the Heat. Now someone is on here saying the refs gave the Pacers the series???? Again, in a 7-game series, the best team wins.
DanNY24621810::don't speak for other real NBA fans, the refs had nothing to do with Lebron destroying the pacers
DanNY24621810::so the word fact said that?
WOODY.3435656::thats right
barcodedlife::It's a shame Lebron was too scared to face the knicks.
cbbaseball19::too*
cbbaseball19::Better ;)
barcodedlife::There you go. Happy grammar drama queen?
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::he knows if the heat lose again with him starting the refs will call a fairer game in the playoffs
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::Dwyane Wade couldn't tie Melo's shoe. And neither could Bosh.
chanchoso::Are we talking about the same FINALS MVP Wade? Couldn't tie a ring-less guy's shoe? Kinda makes no sense...
Barona41::Melo wears diabetic shoes?
Zundweebi::Keep him.
King Taint::cuz melo has velcro shoes?
King Taint::slavery still exists?   thats awful
Aicyla22::ohhhhh you beat me i was just about to hit send dammit
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::Because Melo owns them.
Barona41::Knicks fans, I'll stop if you guys  just stop and don't compare regular season wins to playoff wins.. You only have like 1 in the last 10 years so stop. For your own sake
garnolfini::Regular season wins don't matter. Unless they are Heat regular reason wins.  -- philosophy of the Heat fan
Aicyla22::let them have their moment they dont get it too often
cbbaseball19::Well, Im picking the Angels
GaspoMinnyFan981::I'm picking my nose
I was trying to think of a clever username but i failed::ror copy kitten
brandonlee561heat22::Took the Raps
I was trying to think of a clever username but i failed::i'm picking my nose
King Taint::in the outfield or endzone?
LebronJames2015MVP::Only the Bobcats have less playoff wins than the Knicks these last 13 years.... No wonder why these fans are so pumped for regular season wins.
DanNY24621810::we're pumped because our team is better than it has been in forever, is there something wrong with that? Its called being a fan
25pollo86::Knicks beat the heat by 20 when Knicks had injuries n heat had all starters ... Stop hating heat fans Knicks 3-1 vs heat n that 1gm y'all won y'all escaped with it ..bad calls down the stretch too like that block lebron did on chandler he was holding chandlers elbow
Swade_ND_Shade::Remember to be back here when Knicks are cut from the first round as always.
King Taint::you cry a lot
25pollo86::3-1 watch out in playoffs
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::Here's to zombies and murders!
Pls rest lebron force bosh to pull weight instead::Lol Knicks fan talking about murderers?  Seriously?
cbbaseball19::I like The Walking Dead too! Great show isnt it?
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4awVqRr1eCo
Barona41::Is it me or does anyone else believe the Heat gave the knicks that playoff win last year
KNICKS KNICKS KNICKS NYK::Yeah you're reaching. But who cares, getting swept is no difference from getting bounced in 5.
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::When Melo outrebounds your big man as a SF you know you are in trouble in a 7 game series.
Swade_ND_Shade::So Melo is the clear cut MVP winner this year?
WOODY.3435656::lmfao you got jokes
KnicksCuseGiantsYanks::Melo is outrebounding bosh for the season. check the stats
ref sees kobe hit lilard on head for game tying 3 no foul::i'm out for now, this is too easy --me now, also melo vs old country buffet
