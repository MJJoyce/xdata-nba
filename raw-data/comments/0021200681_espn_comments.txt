FakeGlasses::Steve Blake has more assists off of the bench than Nash as the Lakers lose to Los Suns?  Say it ain't sooooo...
mikeisildur::You know, all the trolls say that this team is lottery bound and relish in its struggles.  But I think we've already seen flashes of greatness and what they're truly capable of.  It's not too late for the Phoenix Suns to turn their season around.
TWCsuck5::The Lakers won't make the playoffs for this reason only: There are too many Chief's and not enough Indians.
gordlig::The incredible win streak comes to an end and they stll haven't won a road game this year.  No playoffs for these clowns.
Bill92264::Well they did lose to the Suns last night who played like a team trying to win a lottery pick... the Lakers!
Emil4617::and the big win streak for the lakers......... ended??
Mambaholic 33::Lebron: $17,545.000.......Lamborghini   Kobrick: $27,845,000.......Hyundai ????
Bill92264::Lebron's Heat:    29 - 13... Lamborghini  Kobe's Leakers: 20 - 26...Hyundai
utfanatic2007::Lebron: Ferrari  Kobe: ...Audi?
Bill92264::The Lakers team payroll this year is over $100 million, which is $15 million more than the next team (the Heat).  Why would you buy a Cadillac and then spend all season driving around in a Hyundai?
Legends of Past::damn people dissing the lakers and dissing kobe need to get lives. this is all you guys do on a daily basis. such NERDS
Mambaholic 33::16 1/2 more years and then there even...
Legends of Past::i guess
bjstyxs::The only thing bryant is tryin to do by tryin to dish out assists is get attention, just like hes done his whole career... He needs attention like a small child, and it gets more pathetic every year. Hes finally realized after all these years that if he plays the ballhog like hes always been, the team loses.. Look it up, thats a fact.. So now he wants to try and be the assist leader and take Nashs job which he cant do either... The sooner the cry baby non convicted rapist retires, the better off the lakers will be..
why are nfl players the only footballers to be padded up::i had the flu this game  --kobe bryant
why are nfl players the only footballers to be padded up::Kobe bryant shot 1 - 5 in the final 3minutes of the game, but im guessing it was dwight howards, pau gasol and steve nash's fault the lakers lost.
utfanatic2007::Kobe also had zero assists in the fourth. He continues to perform horribly in the clutch this season.
bjstyxs::Bryant always put it all on his teamates.. Thats the kind of cry baby hes always been. Acts like a lil b-i-t-c-h all the time..
Gabriel Night::Why do all of the stars need to be on the floor at the same time? Just have Kobe+Pau and DH+Nash on separate rotations.
Sam_Cassells_Spaceship::The Lakers are a huge joke.
hrman7::I get points for hitting the rim  -Kobe

bjstyxs::Just another 1 of his lame accuses..
DOCK808::No he didn't
why are nfl players the only footballers to be padded up::he claimed he was injured before game already..  he already had his pre packaged excuse locked and loaded.

DOCK808::Good
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::Howard faking injury again
bjstyxs::Howard doesnt wanna be in a lakers uniform after getting to know how the team is run.. No coaches involved either. Coach Bryant runs the lakers pathetic team.

why are nfl players the only footballers to be padded up::he also scores better than both of them too.. but lebron is closer to mj than sidekick kobe is.. kobe is more like pippen just a sidekick with ok skills but pippen doesnt steal the credit from mj while kobe steals all of shaqs credit
bjstyxs::Shaq should have decked Kobe when he got to LA. Thats all Kobe did when Shaq was there, was complain how Shaq got all the attention. Kobe hates that $@%!. Wants to be recognized everyday, every game, every play of every minute..
jmatthews117::Another loss for the LOSS Angeles Lakers
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::How about Kobe guard Beasley ??? Or Nash guard the other teams pg instead of standing around.

Prometheus Guns::Now that the Kings are leaving.....the Lakers will be the worst team in California.
jmatthews117::Just imagine how many fewer points Kobe would score if he didn't get every call to go his way
mporreca57::That was smartness by Jordan  and when you watched it live it was so fast and quick you couldnt even see it. Only on replay. Jordan at 35 years old would average 35 a game if he played in this era
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::Jordan was a champion at 35

I love sports big booty and chicken littles::The lakers have the oldest backcourt in the nba  No chemistry on defense  No chemistry on the bench  Coach sucks  No leadership Howard is a diva   There's a reason fisher was the team captain ... Nash is scared to lead cause Kobe's rings intimidate him

I love sports big booty and chicken littles::Kobe at practice today?
gorillaplus2000::Someone reported repeated KLANGS coming from the gym, so it appears he is.
xo0p::LOL
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::12.3% keep that number in mind .. Flankers are done
coach Ks hair dye::the problem for the lakers defensively besides age is position. two of their most important players are back to the basket 5 man centers. gasol is being forced to the four to gaurd the nbas new breed of stretch power forwards like lebron melo durant and josh smith. a couple years ago he could pull this off enough to still be a total plus for the lakers with his size mis-match at the other end, but now he just cann't and dwight isn't explosive enough post back surgery to solve all the defensive issues. gasol and howard both defend a position that isn't even listed on the all-star ballots.
bjstyxs::Dwight Howard, if none of u realized it, and those who do, is just a big very stupid, dumb 7 footer who cant move, cant shoot any kind of jumper, and is weak like kendrick perkinsunderneath. Hes a waiste of money for whatever team may want him next year. and he gets worse every year.
bjstyxs::he should do stand up comedy since he only wants to smile all the time instead of play ball..
LA Clipp Joint::coach K's hair dye knows whats up
coach Ks hair dye::thats what i keep trying to tell these people
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::Metta used to guard 3-4 position but he plays zero defense ... In his deranged mind he's the nba's 3 point champ
coach Ks hair dye::between metta, kobe, and nash the lakers 1-3 starters are over 100 years old
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::Nash lead the NBA in assist last year at 12 per game..  He has a better cast and his old coach and averages 4 with lakers ...wtf
bjstyxs::nash didnt lead the NBA in assistes last year. Rondo do did. Rondo averaged about 12 a game i believe, and nash was at about 10.. look it up, ill bet im close to bein right.
xo0p::hes not allowed to handle the ball with Kobe there
jmatthews117::I bet you the Lakers won't lose a single playoff series this year...  Because they won't play in one
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::The lakers were swept with Phil Jackson running the show... Not sure he can get this group to win either
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::Phil was swept with a better squad.. The same  squad that won 2 and went to 3 finals in a row,.... This group only looks good on Xbox
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::This group doesnt play any defense
jmatthews117::They weren't swept with this group
Prometheus Guns::ESPN saying that the Lakers are a bad team, is like the New York Times saying Obama is a bad POTUS.
jmatthews117::Lakers squeak one out at home vs the worst team in the west and then lose to the 2nd worst team the next night. Where are all the articles about the Lakers winning formula now?
gorillaplus2000::Lakers start struggling, and Kobe starts jacking shots.  Gee......who would have thought that would happen.
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::First Kobe starts to ball hog hurts everyones numbers ... Now he passes like crazy but takes away from Nash.  Kobe needs the triangle to be successful. It allows him to force shots but the ball movement allows others to get involved..  Kobe needs Phil bottom line
zinkerled::Kobe should be running the triangle with Pau on the bench.  It's so obvious.
gorillaplus2000::Phil is sitting at home laughing his nuts off.
zinkerled::Btw Kobe is the coach of this horrible team, not D'Antoni.  Does anyone really think it was D'Antoni's idea for Kobe to be shooting so much or to take the ball out of Nash's hands?  People saying D'Antoni's system doesn't work are morons.  They haven't used his system.
zinkerled::Espn isn't allowed to criticize Kobe.  This bad Lakers season will forever be a big mystery.  Or D'Antoni's fault.
I love sports big booty and chicken littles::Send complaints to mark gross executive VP... He's a native new Yorker
Nucky Pinkman::Love ESPN blaming Howard making fun of his injury while Kobe shoots 17 times for 17 points and has 6 turnovers.  What is going on with this delusional network?
DOCK808::They didn't get 9 dimes either!!!!!!
gorillaplus2000::All 9 in the first 3 quarters.   Not even one in the 4th quarter, which is when they lost the game.
DOCK808::Why you blaming Kobe? What the rest of them bums do?
LA Clipp Joint::they didn't blow a layup with the game on the line
gorillaplus2000::They didn't turn the ball over 6 times.
EoaRider::Amnesty Kobe and Lakers are contendors
DOCK808::I'm a basketball fan!!!!!!!! And people keep taking up for this bum. No defense part-time offense and crying about not starting. KICK ROCKS GASOFT
DanNYC2108::i'd gladly have him on my team
DOCK808::He's not one of our best players. He is the weakest link!!!!!!! A crybaby with NO DEFENSE!!!!!!
DanNYC2108::you are a terrible laker fan, you should be ashamed
DOCK808::Never!!!!!!! Ship out that bumb GASOFT and their contenders
DanNYC2108::yea, because getting rid of one of your best players always helps
DanNYC2108::I still can't believe they blew that lead last night
DOCK808::No they don't!!!!!! And we're talking about GASOFT, Howard is averagins 2blks a game. And you dont see him getting dunked on like GASOFT.
DanNYC2108::they don't dunk on everyone? it sure seems like it
DOCK808::GASOFT needs to go he's ALL offense and not that good at that. The Clippers dunk all over him, Jordan, Griffin and whoever else on that team.
DanNYC2108::griffin and jordan dunk on everyone, and besides, isn't that what you got dwight for?
DOCK808::They actully need Piercce, but Mitch might not be able to pull it off.
DOCK808::Give him Gasol's minutes and touches. The man can drive, shoot the 3 play BOTH foward positions and is a better defender. Shop GASOFT as soon as possible!!!!!! Plus he's crying about not starting, dude kick rocks.
DanNYC2108::He averages more FGA per game in less minutes than Gasol.
Prometheus Guns::As a Spurs fan, hearing Laker fans scream that Jeff Green is your savior and answer is MUSIC!!!!!
DanNYC2108::i really can't believe it, Green isn't even in the same stratosphere as Gasol.
DOCK808::Never Jeff Green is a soldier!!!!!! GASOFT is a P%$$Y and it showed last night when Howard left.
DanNYC2108::Green doesn't even average 10 ppg
DOCK808::Why? He's the worst defensive big man in the game!!!!!!!! He choked last night without Howard there, LBJ flew around like a superhero in the Miami and BLake Griffin and the rest of the Clips have him filled in their highlight reels. THE MOST OVERRATED PLAYER IN THE NBA!!!!!!!
DanNYC2108::JEFF GREEN IS HORRIBLE. Pau Gasol is one of the best big men in the NBA. D'antoni just doesn't know how to use him
DOCK808::They need to shop GASOFT to Boston for Jeff Green
DanNYC2108::they would be incredibly dumb
zinkerled::Seriously, trying to make Nash a spot up shooter?  He's 6'2 and shoots from his chest.  Oh, and he's probably still the best playmaker in the league.  'Kobe's team' is so stupid.
DOCK808::Nash is old and needs to retire.
scottpilgrim33::It's 4:21 pm and the Lakers still suck
