wow really just wow::a
S71498::dOC NEEDS TO LET GREEN PLAY MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ratcw72::The cats one because of Mullens. Mullens had potential in highschool. Its just people didnt give him a chance. He could be an all-star but got injures early in the season
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Dammit! Go CELTICS.
Lebroncouldcareless::LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LEBRON.
Dwayne_Johnson23::I like it more when we win
msonic69::The second game of a back to back is no excuse for losing, it just means you lost to a superior team!  -Celtics Fans the night before when they squeaked by the Nuggz
Dave6673::Strong third quarter for KG after his halftime nap 0-0, way to come out strong against a weak team and build on that halftime lead! Also props for allowing a guy who averages 7 rebounds a game to get 18
Pusherman3::Bobcats need to write the Nuggets a thank you.
LetTheTruthBeHeard::mullens didnt even touch the ball in the 4th! cats shouldve won by more
jay9singer::The C's must not of got all those calls like the night before against the Nuggets.  That was a complete rob job by the refs.
brisilk::jay9singer - The C's must not of got all those calls like the night before against the Nuggets.  That was a complete rob job by the refs.  No, Doc didn't play Green and Lee in the final minutes of the game when KG and PP were running on fumes and AB went ice cold.
natanognikrow::I agree with brisilk. I like Doc, but sometimes I don't know what he's thinking. Green and CLee would have been a much better lift than KG and PP. Doc is not doing much to built team confidence. Have "you ever heard the statement, "ride em' til their wheels fall off"? They just did.
jeremy8769::This is a microcosm of the Celtics. Nice winning streak over solid teams, then let B.J. Mullens and the Bobcats beat you. I hate to say it; but they need to get what they can while they can for KG and PP.
JeffCT18::They did beat some tough teams but every difficult game was at home..makes life a lot easier.
BobcatsFan212::O yea baby lets Go Bobcats!!!! Good job beating the washed up old Celtics. We have the brighter future. Lets go Cats!!
chrisbradley35::I am a huge Bobcat fan and I am happy we might bouble our win total from last year. But at this rate it is going to take 10 years to make a serious run at a playoff spot. Why is Skip Bayless saying Jordan should come back and play?  I for one do not see it happening. What are your thoughts on Jordan playing again?
bostonceltics344::If I was Danny Ainge, I would trade Rondo for Westbrook for next year
dickiedave4.0::OKC would never do it.
UnderdogswillriseEventually::At least that losing streak is over. Hollinger puts it at 0.1% odds of making the playoffs, and I'll take those odds any day of the week.
Lebroncouldcareless::ALL DOWN HILL FROM HERE ON OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sweett0179::They were already on the hill since they lost to miami in the conference finals.. what u talkingabout...
jeremy8769::Lebron could care less? So, does he care the maximum amount?
EBphinfan::I hope the Heat will face the Celtics in the first round. should be a clean sweep.
SJU2Hawks::I hope you drown in your bathtub
Lebroncouldcareless::LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  LEBRON JAMES
smack9090::HOWARD IS SOME TRASH...i feel sorry for the lakers
bostonceltics344::I hope the Bobcats fans are happy with there 12th win of the season
Lebroncouldcareless::u seem mad lol!
ThatsGoodSoup7963::I imagine they have found some satisfaction in halting the leagues longest win streak.
kaharevic::Mullens&gt;Celtics
aherg24::Mullens is maturing every game he plays.
JBahr25::F### the HEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Careful, now.
JBahr25::I know, I'll get banned
JBahr25::WTF?  I keep seeing theses D-Wade videos of this mortal combat kick he did the other night.  How was he given the foul on that one?  Rules say it's illegal to kick your leg out at an opponent.  F### the Heat, F - Wade F- James.
ThatsGoodSoup7963::It's way more fun when we win.
argenis fradique::You can't stop Byron Mullens you can only hope to contain him.  Was KG playing last night?? 18 rebounds. New Celtic killer Byron Mullens
Dave6673::Reminds me of the time Gasol outrebounded KG 18 to 3 in the 2010 NBA finals!
sweett0179::...and lost the finals
ChrisEFaw::*Mullens
argenis fradique::That's funny. So unknown I couldn't even get his spelling of his last name correct. lol. Their we go. All better.
.Pumbaa.::Celtis are bad and old
r7157::Should have never gotten rid of Baby
ThatsGoodSoup7963::I miss Glen Davis.
JBahr25::He's out with a broke foot right now
kane FTW::wow whats with all these dumb mother****** saying that the C's need to give up. LMFAO
robert3711::yeah but i think they loss that game against chicago
kane FTW::lol, the C's are fine. it's dumb to expect them to win a back to back game coming from a triple overtime game and to make things worse they had to travel. They are good to go next game against Chicago. Please if you don't know anything about how the regular season works then shut up.
LetsPlayScRyB::they need to give up for real
bostonwildcats::Pathetic!   They will reap what Danny has sown!!!!
LetsPlayScRyB::My oh my
Clueless Heat Fan::the bottom of the east cant hang these gramps will end up10th
argenis fradique::Dont feel to bad Celtic fans, This game was very predictable. Money in the bank!! Thanks Charlotte and thanks to a 3 ot game and travel after game for Boston.
brisilk::argenis fradique - Dont feel to bad Celtic fans, This game was very predictable. Money in the bank!! Thanks Charlotte and thanks to a 3 ot game and travel after game for Boston.  It was predictable b/c of Doc's horrible coaching decisions.  Where was Jeff Green in the 4th quarter???????????????????????????????????????????
brisilk::The C's last 2 losses (to the Bobcats and the double OT loss in Atlanta on 1/25) fall squarely on the shoulders of Doc. What is Jeff Green doing on the bench for the last 6 min (besides his in bounding the ball w/ 13 sec. to play) of the 4th quarter??? Jeff was having his most efficient game of the season, was getting to the basket at will (7-7 from the line, and he was hacked at least 2 other times----&gt; I can recall his drive to the hoop at the end of the 1st half) and the Cats had no one to guard him one on one. How about giving Jeff the ball on one of the last few possessions when the C's ended up shooting 0-6!!!!!! Just like in that Hawks game when the bench was fantastic (look at their +/- stats), Doc stuck with the starters (who were running on fumes) for too LONG!!! Like previous posters have suggested Doc isn't even in the same ballpark as Pop when it comes to coaching. C's should have a 9 game winning streak going into Wed. revenge game vs the Bulls.
88bryant18::Too many road games ahead.  Celts are done.
brisilk::88bryant18 - Too many road games ahead.  Celts are done.  Wow, you give up far to easily young fella.
stevem74::time to break these guys up. serious contenders don't lose to low level teams like this, even on back to back nights.
brisilk::Another young pup giving up before the all star break!!!  Were you spouting the same nonsense last year????
brisilk::micheal3600 - and another old fart hanging on to the past  Yeah, because taking the Heat to 7 games with NO BENCH last June is SOOOOO LONG AGO!!!!  Young fella, brain cells don't start working until you hit 30.  I suggest you hit the books and educate yourself!!!!
micheal3600::and another old fart hanging on to the past
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Damn.
Dribbird.::Just no more injuries, please.
smokinstogies305::Does not bode well for Rondo's worth that this team looks like a top 4 team in the east since he went down.
BMO1616::It's absolutely astounding how many "out for the season" injuries the Boston teams have had the last 5 years. Scary to think the most "dominant decade a sports city has ever had" could've been even more dominant.
georgepan::LOL.  One measly championship in 27 years, despite having a true "Big 3" and a great coach is pathetic, not dominant.   The Celtics have underperformed relative to the incredible amount of money they have shoveled out ever since the Big 3 were put together.  Other teams have had "out for the season" injuries, but they just move on instead of whining incessantly.   Boston "fans" are just "different," I guess.
diehardnr1::and here I thought it was Eli Manning, Montreal Canadians, Big 3 Old Age, and bad BoSox moves that had knocked you guys down a peg or three...
LetsPlayScRyB::i guess ur a h-o-m-o yankee fan rite?
diehardnr1::Those road B2B are lots of fun, huh Celts? Whats more fun is seeing all the people who were talking about Celtics in Finals after DEN game are now posting that the team should be blown up!  Hilarious and only possible in a fickle fan base (aka half the Celtic "fans")...Priceless
brisilk::diehardnr1 - Those road B2B are lots of fun, huh Celts?

Hilarious and only possible in a fickle fan base (aka half the Celtic "fans")...Priceless  The only fools posting that nonsense are young pups (silly teenie boppers who weren't born or in diapers when Magic, Larry, and MJ revolutionized b-ball) who have no clue about the nuances of the game!!!!
micheal3600::they shouldnt blow the team up, but you have no clue if you think this team is doing anything come playoff time
bencarewww::too bad... They were close... Go BOSTON!!!!!!!!       http://BostonHighlights.qr.net/sportblogs
Greygoose crew::KG is old
The Genious Man::It's about time to trade KG to Clippers.
ndcccc::Long home stand, now back on the road where the Celtic have not done well this year. 18 more road games out of 31total. We will see how good they are and started out with a loss to the Cats.
manimarf09::I wondered if this might be a "trap" game for the C's.
Nayrock10::just keep the Knicks  ahead yes
Supa Saiyan Chris::Should i trim my leg hairs?
hulk-smash-20::only after turning golden ape
Le-Goat::Impressive Celtics
