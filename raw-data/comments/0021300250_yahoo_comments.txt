Chaplain::I don't see how Andre D could be on the bench for the last 21 minutes of any game with this roster. Maybe he doesn't play with Miami, San Antonio, or Indiana every game: but even on those teams, I believe he would play. Maurice Cheeks should not do that ever again!
THE_CHIEF::I think Monroe is the most expendable of the three in Detroit. He has the highest value and they need a stud at the 2 or 3 to make the leap.  Monroe for Jeff Green and a bag of chips.
frank s::Drummond has all the god giving gifts of an all star center. But like most them that are given these gifts they are not working on the basics of the game like free throws. They are free and should not be given away and should be captured. There should be no excuses
kevinl::from a pacer fan,drummond is the real deal,what a player to have.
THE REAL DWIGHT::i just love how conroe flick off the ref when he got ejected lol
fup duck::drum-a-drummond is a wise move
B2ones::its nice to see a player labeled as a "project" to actually develop into a solid pro
Commenter::two suckish teams but i say philadelphia wins it in a close one 95 to 92
THE REAL DWIGHT::drummonf has a big game going on lets see if he can heep it up
C K::Drummond is good but he needs to learn how to shoot free throws
