TheNewStern::Q: If today is Wednesday, how many days has it been since Noah's had a shower?
Dem_Canes_Man::Well Kaman does not equal a Turiaf....  But it's better not to have the United States Congress having meetings on the Miami Heat.
fairandbalanced00::With Bosh playing the way he is playing now, the Heat will have no problem going through the EC, chicago cannot contain CB and if he attacks the rim like he has been doing in the Finals, then, the big 3 will get their first ring of many together.
fairandbalanced00::If they feed him the ball, Bosh will deliver, he is a high percentage shooter, for some reason Spoelstra does not make plays for him in the fourth quarter.
Dem_Canes_Man::agreed....whenever there are times that Bosh has it going or has the advantage, they have to go to him....he is a true triple threat on the block, and a excellent FT shooter.   Easy Buckets!
Dem_Canes_Man::yeah...you would like to see Bosh in that 19-21 range at 9-10rbs a game; with a high percentage.
RunTheBall22::turiaf is putting up big numbers this year--1.5ppg and 3rpg. OH NO!!!!!!!
Dem_Canes_Man::lol...he is a monster!
Dem_Canes_Man::Ronny Turiaf....not bad....  He's not the 2nd coming of Bill Russell but he has size and he is a solid defender.
brandonlee561heat22::I'd rather get Turiaf than Fisher
Dem_Canes_Man::he got about 21 games left in the reg. season.
brandonlee561heat22::Yea, hopefully he learn the defense quick
Dem_Canes_Man::and what I like most is that he is a legit 6'10" guy.
Dem_Canes_Man::yes...agreed! Plus, he's a Frenchman!
HEAT ARE THE BEST EVER 10::$@%! ya heat! U GON WIN THE SUPERBOWL
princechristopherII::new big three positions bosh is 1 now wade is 2 and james is 3
Dem_Canes_Man::it all depends on match ups.
princechristopherII::it kills me how last week everyone said bosh sucks and now eveyone is dickriding
princechristopherII::what does that mean
mintzerkj4eva::People who react and change their mind as soon as something happens
mintzerkj4eva::knee jerkers
mintzerkj4eva::Ronny Turiaf  is finalizing a  deal with Miami. Im okay with that
brandonlee561heat22::Me too.
mintzerkj4eva::BOSHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  Real heavy on the SHHHHHH
brandonlee561heat22::He played awesome!
Franco2187::oh crybron is a little sore today
brandonlee561heat22::Derek Fisher to OKC
Dem_Canes_Man::yep...it seems like it.
mogana20::cHeat.
mfin04::Also, gotta love how the whole article is about whether or not LeBron is ok, after running over Grant Hill who set a perfectly legal screen. Yet, LeBron the Almighty, didn't get called for what was an obvious foul.
mfin04::No reason to watch WWE if I get my wrestling fix with LeBron off the top rope right into Grant Hill, and LeBron wins every match. ;)
matheus1989::u suprise everybody knows that THE NBA wants baby bron bron to win something,, but reminding people aint goin to change that
matheus1989::Watch WWE dude and stop the Bitchin
mfin04::Heat get down ten, and magically they shoot 17 free throws in the 4th quarter (12 of those after they were down 10). If I wanted to watch something that was fixed I'd watch WWE.
oinkpiggies::17, really. Damn, that's a lot. Meh, oh well either way... .. a way to stop that is to make your shots.
matheus1989::then watch wwe and stop bitchin
Dem_Canes_Man::I want to apologize to Westbrook.  8-11 with 23 pts.  Durant: 6-22 with 18 pts.  Durant is still the #1 option though, but I do stand corrected Westbrook. :)
Dem_Canes_Man::I don't think the Bucks catch Boston or New York.
nba is the worst::Tied with the Knicks in losses - but I can understand you not wanting them in the playoffs  ;)
RunTheBall22::only one game back of the Knicks and by far the easiest schedule
Dem_Canes_Man::wow...you are right...the Bucks got it made for real....  it's going to be interesting to see how they respond to playing with expectations though.
brandonlee561heat22::All it takes is one bad week, 3 or 4 win's or losses in a row, and you could drop out or move up in the playoff race
RunTheBall22::Looks like Ellis and the Bucks are a good fit and they are just a few games out of the seven seed. not good news for the heat
JB_Smoove_Listens_With_Dre_Beats_Only::We'll see. they gotta go up against the Celtics' defense tomorrow.
JB_Smoove_Listens_With_Dre_Beats_Only::Im hoping we pick up boris diaw. we need another big to contend with Chicago
JB_Smoove_Listens_With_Dre_Beats_Only::He's been playing center since the All Star break.
Dem_Canes_Man::Kg can play the 5, but their rebounding is horrible.
RunTheBall22::Deng is 6'9 and KG is not a real center. LOL
JB_Smoove_Listens_With_Dre_Beats_Only::The celtics' center is KG who is 6'11 lol
RunTheBall22::The bulls small forward is taller than the Celtics Center
RunTheBall22::oh I'm sorry are the Celtics still in the playoff race?
Dem_Canes_Man::you should know by now that playoff basketball is a different animal.
Dem_Canes_Man::true that.
RunTheBall22::never said it wasn't
Miami Sports Is Back::We win (again)!  Just another usual day on the Heat boards the haters come out even when the heat show why they are the clutchest team in the NBA.
JB_Smoove_Listens_With_Dre_Beats_Only::Getting bailed out by refs = clutch, according to THIS miami fan.
LauraVanDerBooben2::Miami sports is back but if you attend your house will get robbed and your family murdered. They're back alright. Fuc king piece of shi t post.
Dem_Canes_Man::hey man...don't tempt people to come on the board trolling!  but yeah...good win for the Heat, but I don't know what to make of the "clutchest" reference. :)
nba is the worst::THE REFS SURE WERE CLUTCH!
RunTheBall22::can you back that up?
kaharevic::More anticapated game of the season, Miami vs OKC, Miami vs Bulls, or Miami vs Lakers?
kaharevic::I would say miami vs okc, since a lot of people of those 2 going in the finals.
JB_Smoove_Listens_With_Dre_Beats_Only::Miami vs Boston round 2. The first matchup was a fluke because the Celtics were missing pierce and key bench players that they have now.. But it depends on who you ask lol
matheus1989::still goin to lose
Dem_Canes_Man::fluke....I think now.  But that was last year.
kaharevic::Jeff green will be out, Jermaine oneal will be out, and the other big man forgot his name. Theres no telling when injuries might hit the celtics. It will be a good game if everyones healthy.
matheus1989::Miami vs OKC..
brandonlee561heat22::Id say MIA vs OKC, or LA, since they only play those two teams twice.
Dem_Canes_Man::Heat gets 2 days off....need that....take care of Detroit and get ready for OKC.
JB_Smoove_Listens_With_Dre_Beats_Only::Finally the match up we've ALL been waiting for. OKC has been struggling as of late though, mainly KD. Seems like just the game he needs to get out of his slump.
kaharevic::In OKC or in Miami?
brandonlee561heat22::They both have a win streak of 14 at home, but OKC's was just broken by the Spurs.
kaharevic::oh they did? Well i guess NBA TV is a good resource then, they said miami and okc have the same wining streaks at home.
brandonlee561heat22::Spurs just beat them in OKC
kaharevic::Then it looks like OKC 14 game winning streak at home will be over.
brandonlee561heat22::OKC
Dem_Canes_Man::OKC.
kaharevic::Miami needs bosh to play well. When he scores 20 and puts up 10 rebounds, Miamis a hard team to beat. Hes kinda of the x factor.
Dem_Canes_Man::that is why Riley had to get him here. UD starting at the 4 wasn't going to cut it.
kaharevic::oh defenitly not, his skill set is good for a 4. I just like the way he fights for every postion, hustling, rebounding, etc.
Dem_Canes_Man::yeah, but his skill set doesn't fit the 3 obviously.
kaharevic::He is undersized for a 4, more of a size for the 3. Kinda like big baby. Miami is a undersized team.
Dem_Canes_Man::6 years ago....playing beside Shaq and Zo.   I just don't like the fact that his shot gets block on the put back like crazy. He is undersized though.
kaharevic::But it did cut it in 2006. But yeah UD is more of a back up 4, a very good back up 4
brandonlee561heat22::They are 13-2 when he scores 20 or more
JB_Smoove_Listens_With_Dre_Beats_Only::Bout time the trolls left, now lets talk basketball.  Miami has the most athletic defense in the league.  Thoughts?  .
kaharevic::defeintly, most of the other teams, Bulls, Celtics, etc., play the old school defense(very effecient). I like miamis atheltic defese casuing turnovers running the ball.
Dem_Canes_Man::agreed.
kaharevic::Eddy Curry got to play for the first time in a while, he looked horrible, on defense and offense,. Which was expected.
Dem_Canes_Man::yeah....big fella not looking to form right now.
Dem_Canes_Man::is the room clear?
brandonlee561heat22::Think so
Dem_Canes_Man::got it.
nba is the worst::Save the email address for the mods - they will usually get rid of a particular hack spammer within an hour or so (put spam and the page ID in the email header, i.e." Heat-Suns page spam")
Dem_Canes_Man::man...it's like ducking for cover!
richardduckworth::of everything except windhorst's fat smugness, yeah
richardduckworth::i don't like windhorst's fat smirk  he's looking at me like he doesn't think he's fat.   you're not husky windhorst, you're fat.
