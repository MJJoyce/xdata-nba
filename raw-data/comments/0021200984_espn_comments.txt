JimMoss360::Is the Pistons coach absolutely awful or what?
bamberg1977::Frank hasn't coached the team in weeks. Are you talking about Brian Hill? Pistons have the core to their team injured right now in Drummond and Knight.
mpjackso::Good Game Wes Matthews!
Roweey::CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHY SINGLER GETS STARTERS MINUTES AND GOES 2 of 10 AND NEVER DOES ANYthing while corey maggette gets none....
Ivanov21::Just about any player is better than Maggette right now. guy doesn't know what to do without the ball..giving a young player the starting position will pay off in the future
bamberg1977::Singler plays with out the ball and can shoot a little. Maggette is just another head down driver way past his prime. Didn't Singler just have 17 a couple days ago?
mpjackso::favoritism
MetsxlxNLxlxChampsxlx2013::Anyone want live up to date Earl Watson news hit me up on twitter @EarlWatson33    Get in the head of one of the greats because the days are winding down on his illustrious career     #ETPW46THMAN
Kobelies247::Wow LA actually played like an Allstar!! Its about time...
IversonDaGreatest3::greg monroe overrated as f*** imo,atleast yall got drummond though..
denn19641::Tell me, who else among the Pistons that the opposing team should guard?
DetKoolAid::yeah a 3rd year player avg 16-9-3 is overrated? cmon man use common sense. No one said hes an all star but that he has talent. And he plays out of position, he is a power forward, when Drummond comes back he should improve that much more playing his natural position instead of center
BaySports 1.1::Through 66 games last year Portland had 28 wins.  Through 65 games this year we have 31 wins.
Domo.Genesis::cool
Booty Loaf_::wtf does "did not dress - team decision" mean?
CBass1317::team prefers him naked
Samac112::team decided for him to not dress up for the game
Booty Loaf_::ahhhh. but why didn't he play then?
Strike 1 yer OUT::does maynor even do anything anymore?
CBass1317::Had 20 points the other night, career high 12 assists the game before that.  Dude has been playing great.
southbeachginja::He is the best bench player on the blazers...
MetsxlxNLxlxChampsxlx2013::i was scared shitless with the 24.9 remaining... i had the pistons +11.5 and the blazers show great sportsmanship to take the violation
JimMoss360::you bet on the NBA? weird.

DTownSportsLions::No because you keep on posting it
southbeachginja::Yep, I am leaving these boards now. Its a bad day for intelligent discussion  -Kobe24 is Monta Ellis without Phil and Shaq  Yes and intelligent conversation is when you accuse someone of having aspergers
Domo.Genesis::you're not smart, you made an argument that Durant would be as good as curry if he took 0 free throws a game
southbeachginja::You want to read any conversation board.  There are tons of people who agree with me
southbeachginja::Also, curry would be BETTER than durant if he took 0 free throws a game
southbeachginja::And you are not smart either.  If you don't like my opinion, then why do you keep on following my posts

Brianhau529::Anyone read JJ Hickson's twitter? I'm not into that stuff but its pretty sad. It looks like he is depressed
gunnesack::Hmmm
Brianhau529::http://instagram.com/p/WvzdiAptxX/
Domo.Genesis::southbeachginja i'm just saying the "best player in the world" shouldn't be relying on free throws to get his points. Also, steph is denitely not the best player in the world, or top 10 for that matter _________ Lebron is better than Durant, and those are 8.5 of his points. Even if he only made 6 free throws a game, he's still 3rd in scoring
Domo.Genesis::and Durant doesn't just score, he averages 8 rebounds a game, and he's been a way better passer this year
CBass1317::Relies on the line?  But he gets to the line.  So it works.  That would only be a problem if he stopped getting there for some reason.  Prob not gonna happen.
southbeachginja::it's just my opinion.  I have watched durant, and i think he relies to much on the line
Domo.Genesis::I already said Lebron was better.  Just saying Durant isn't overrated.
TheJTram::Don't forget, what you just said, Lebron's been doing his entire career
49ersGoat::I'm going to punch zach marcopulos in the ovaries.
Philip3664::Well good game Blazers fans. Pistons put up a decent fight, just too much Aldridge and they got destroyed on the boards.
CBass1317::Stuck and Bynum were tough.  Blazers rim protection is pretty pitiful.  Hopefully Leonard improves next year and helps with that.
Ill-Blaze::yea I didn't see the board differential being that huge
Pstnzballaz::I'm excited to see Detroit next season. Knight and Drummond will be healthy. We have money to spend on some quality players, hopefully Calderon comes back. And most likely a solid draft pick
CBass1317::They won't pay Calderon.  Not with Knight.
49ersGoat::CubfanBU Sure was nervous early in this one... Have 14k on POR money line  ________________________________  Translation: he bet $14
CBass1317::Bet my soul on the money line tonight.  Thank god for Aldridge.  Another day not in purgatory!
Zombie Jerry Buss::Yeah I had 14.5k on the Blazers moneyline (better than you)
zach marcopulos::https://www.facebook.com/pages/NBA-Discussion/332369173536488
Domo.Genesis::Kobe24 is Monta Ellis Without Phil and Shaq And steph curry is a superstar. Although comparing Durant to Curry is apples and oranges. __________ hahahahaha Curry is not a superstar
Kobe24 is Monta Ellis Without Phil and Shaq::Yep, I am leaving these boards now. Its a bad day for intelligent discussion.
TheJTram::Curry's a star but not a superstar
southbeachginja::FOR HEAVENS SAKE YES
southbeachginja::the guy is a frickin idiot just try to ignore him
zach marcopulos::https://www.facebook.com/pages/NBA-Discussion/332369173536488
zach marcopulos::https://www.facebook.com/pages/NBA-Discussion/332369173536488
Domo.Genesis::southbeachginja So basically without the free throws he is just as good as stephen curry _______ quick question.  what kind of a small forward in the NBA takes 0 free throws?
southbeachginja::Not 0 free throws.  Just like 5-7 free throws would bring him down 3-5 points.  Which is comparible to steph curry.
zach marcopulos::https://www.facebook.com/pages/NBA-Discussion/332369173536488
Philip3664::Aldridge always f***ing kills the Pistons
Ill-Blaze::only difference with tonights game compared to the one earlier in the season it will be a win lol
Ill-Blaze::yea dude really went off tonight
dlskdlskdlk::if there is one thing that detroit can do right is close this franchise... i mean seriously... LOL its like carrying a sick dead puppy on top of a sinking economy
denn19641::The priortity right now is for a better lottery position and nothing else.
TheJTram::They don't even play in Detroit...get your facts straight
DTownSportsLions::Pistons are located in Auburn Hills about 25-30 minutes outside of Detroit
swami30::mark my works detroit will cover the -10 easy
TheJTram::Zombie Jerry Buss Guess what? I made a nice block too in 7th grade its also on YouTube lol ------------------------------------------------ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QJ4iwqnLKc  Guess what, if Prince didn't make this block, the Pistons wouldn't have gotten the title that lead to the Lakers butt whooping in the Finals. I'm pretty sure that's much better that some block in middle school. Anyone with common sense would know that
zach marcopulos::https://www.facebook.com/pages/NBA-Discussion/332369173536488
Domo.Genesis::someone called Prince soft today, making a nice block 10 years ago doesn't mean he isn't soft today
Kobe24 is Monta Ellis Without Phil and Shaq::you're arguing with a troll and attention hoar. tayshaun is the dopeness.
Domo.Genesis::southbeachginja definitely one of them. Just watch a game of his, he will get 15 free throws a night ______ he averages 28.3 points a game and 8.5 points from the free throw line.
southbeachginja::So basically without the free throws he is just as good as stephen curry
southbeachginja::i'm just saying the "best player in the world" shouldn't be relying on free throws to get his points.  Also, steph is denitely not the best player in the world, or top 10 for that matter
Kobe24 is Monta Ellis Without Phil and Shaq::And steph curry is a superstar. Although comparing Durant to Curry is apples and oranges.
southbeachginja::thats overrated in my opinion
TheJTram::Look at James Harden though, that dude averages like nearly 11 attempts a night
BaySports 1.1::Aldridge- the quiet All Star.
Philip3664::Another missed layup. Do they even practice them?
49ersGoat::Kyle Singler might have the most unproductive 40 minutes I've seen from a basketball player.
Leeroy1209::Portland is such a corrupt team in the nba bunch of flogs
Leeroy1209::Hahahaha , how can they let a $@%! team like Detroit score a 100 points
Ill-Blaze::twist that pipe up bro remember to melt it first then rock the pipe back and forth
ClydeTheGlide_22::how is a small market team like portland "such a corrupt team"?
49ersGoat::Smoke another bowl, burnout.
Ill-Blaze::what?
Joeb7853::One of the worst road teams in the NBA come into your house and you have to fight for a win. That's why Portland will see little or no playoffs in the next few years.
49ersGoat::Why are you here... no, forget that... why are you alive?
Domo.Genesis::really dumb comment
Philip3664::Give the Pistons credit damn
Philip3664::Damn
Domo.Genesis::southbeachginja Kevin Durant. He gets all his points from the charity stripe ________ lol you think Durant is the most overrated player in the league? wow
southbeachginja::definitely one of them.  Just watch a game of his, he will get 15 free throws a night
southbeachginja::I'm pretty sure you said $@%!$@% Greg Oden is the most overrated player in the league.  So you can shut the !$@% up
Kobe24 is Monta Ellis Without Phil and Shaq::dude. youre an idiot. or a troll. not sure. and not sure which is worse.
justinmosieralamo::i hope portland gets beat they are a bunch of losers
671niners::If and when? Keep smoking..
justinmosieralamo::Dude when the bulls are healthy they will mop Portland up and down the floor
ClydeTheGlide_22::hmmm, they already beat the bulls this season.
Kobe24 is Monta Ellis Without Phil and Shaq::Never make fun of an Aspie online, they will find the time to comment on everything you say.
southbeachginja::Did an "aspie' tick you off?  It's okay, just go back to your cardboard box and tell yourself that you are wanted somewhere in the world
Brianhau529::haha that chick was like get off me to Bynum
Domo.Genesis::adamharris13 Most over rated player in the league is... ?  _______ Melo
adamharris13::dwight howard is a pu sss  yyyy
adamharris13::your're retarted rondo is one of the most efficient players in the league
southbeachginja::Also, he has to put the load of dogcrap that is the knicks on his back and score 40 night after night just to give them a chance
adamharris13::dwight howard... actually he's probably number one. fool cant make a free throw if his life depended on it and whines all the time
Domo.Genesis::Dwight Howard led a team to the nba finals with very little help.  Melo led the Nuggets and Knicks too many first round exits
southbeachginja::technically, he is underrated since he is #18 on espn's top 500 NBA player rankings
southbeachginja::They should, he is the only good player other than chandler on the team.  He is the only one on the team that can create his own shot.  He basically is the whole knicks team
Brianhau529::technically he is overrated because the NY coaching staff treats him like he is #1 in the NBA
DTownSportsLions::Nah.
DTownSportsLions::Brianhau529 - I like Rondo, DTownSportsLions is the fücking idiot  ============= No need for the name calling. One mans opinion.
Brianhau529::He also was the pg of a title team and has been the best player for a while, he can ball hard.
DTownSportsLions::lol Rondo can't shoot and hogs the ball in a bad way on the floor. He's a very good player but IMO overrated. Celtics look better without him.
Brianhau529::I like Rondo, DTownSportsLions is the fücking idiot
adamharris13::yeah mr. triple double rondo. yest
Brianhau529::Rondo??? You're a fücking idiot.
adamharris13::howard williams yes. i like rondo though. i actually think rondo is underrated. dude can ball
DTownSportsLions::Dwight Howard. Deron Williams. Rondo.
Domo.Genesis::who is more overrated then him?
Philip3664::That was nice
justinmosieralamo::$@%! portland
Domo.Genesis::Brianhau529 That dunk was nasty!! _____ for a blazers player? yes it was
CubfanBU::Sure was nervous early in this one... Have 14k on POR money line
adamharris13::no need to be nervous... detroit is the worst team in the league
Domo.Genesis::besides the bobcats
ClydeTheGlide_22::Please, please, please, blazers, resign Hickson.
Ill-Blaze::idk great hustle player but he isn't making our team a contending team unless he came off the bench he doesn't play great defense and isn't gonna help mentor leonard to improve that area of his game I think getting a mentor for leonard should be our top priority this off season I hope hickson signs for less then 7-8mil and takes on a 6th man role
ClydeTheGlide_22::exactly we need to get an actual center and then have jj come off the bench for LA.
Domo.Genesis::stuckey makes a shot and the commentators say good offense by stuckey and even better defense by Matthews.  These commentators are dumb
adamharris13::Most over rated player in the league is... ?
adamharris13::i hate dwight howard to... actually he's probably number one. fool cant make a free throw if his life depended on it and whines all the time
adamharris13::derron williams never wins shhhh i  t
southbeachginja::Kevin Durant.  He gets all his points from the charity stripe
adamharris13::andrew bynum gets my vote... dumb $@% is lazy and is always hurt
southbeachginja::Since when has oden ever been rated?
Kobe24 is Monta Ellis Without Phil and Shaq::can't count players who are injured. if we do that its ODEN forever.
Kobe24 is Monta Ellis Without Phil and Shaq::Kobe Bryant.
Brianhau529::That dunk was nasty!!
BaySports 1.1::Chalupas.  This time Ray Felton isn't stealing them.
MetsxlxNLxlxChampsxlx2013::pathetic meltdown for the pissedons
