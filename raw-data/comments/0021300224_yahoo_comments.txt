I State Facts And You Get Mad::Like I said, Spurs beat weak to average teams but the losses they have now are from elite teams. They can't beat my fabulous Lakers in a best of 7 games. I watched NBA for 27 years living here in my mother’s basement & I never seen a team like the Spurs. If my mother would allow it I would learn to play basketball and beat the Spurs all by myself. Mother says sports are too dangerous for me and I should stick playing with myself while she watches. THIS IS THE 5TH SEASON I WILL SAY IT, SPURS WON'T WIN THE TITLE! HAVE FUN REPLYING TO YOURSELVES CAUSE I WON'T COME BACK TO READ IT LOL, ACTUALL I WILL COME BACK AND READ THE COMMENTS, BUT I LIKE POSTING THAT.
Austin::First off as a Spurs fan I'd like to say good game Thunder fans. A hard fought game that had a playoff feel on the court. Spurs just missed a lot of open 3 pointers early on in the game and it effected the outcome, but everything else about the Spurs' performance was admirable.  I'm happy to see Kawhi Leonard making Durant pretty frustrated tonight. 10-23 from the field, 6 turnovers and only 3 free throw attempts for Durant. That just shows how Kawhi Leonard really affected Durant tonight. If not for Reggie Jackson's outstanding night, Kawhi Leonard would be the game's MVP.
Donald::Jackson and Lamb had the  hot hands for the Thunder as they ended the Spurs winning streak at eleven.  The Spurs had a cold third quarter and the Thunder did not let Parker get started.
PKM::I can"t believe ESPN actually wanted a Cleveland game instead of this game.
Thomas::Pretty frustrated pesron there, HEAT2014CHAMPIONS. Your expertise for these harsh words? Did you play YMCA ball as a third string water boy? If that was the worst choke you ever saw, you must be only wacthing one game in each of those 27 years. I have seen many worse than that, some by your beloved Heat, who bought their championships.
Austin::Still like the Spurs' performance. Spurs had a great defensive game plan, but missed a lot of open 3's early on, and Reggie Jackson was on fire. Good game by both clubs.
Commenter::Like I said, Spurs beat weak to average teams but the losses they have now are from elite teams. They can't beat the Thunder, Heat, Pacers, nor Blazer in a best of 7 games. Where were the Spurs fans when they CHOKED in the Finals? Prentis P, Tay, BB, Terry, Shaw, Phillip, Straitballin, Chapscat, Moses, Donald, proudveteranwoman, Guest, etc? I watched NBA for 27 years & I never seen a team so pathetic & choke like the Spurs. Double digit lead in the 4th, up by 5 with 28 seconds left, Leonard missed 1 freethrow to close out the Finals & Pop took out his rebounders & starters at the end like an idiot! They CHOKED as USUAL LOL. THIS IS THE 5TH SEASON I WILL SAY IT, SPURS WON'T WIN THE TITLE! HAVE FUN REPLYING TO YOURSELVES CAUSE I WON'T COME BACK TO READ IT LOL  2013- CHOKED in game 6 after having the game won & CHOKED against the Heat in Game 7 2012- CHOKED losing 4 straight games after winning 20+ games straight, best record in the west, & being up 2-0 with home court advantage.

ROB'N THA WOOD::IS THIS TIMMY'S WORST SEASON EVER ? Honestly , he should quit on the top. Spurs don't need him anymore . He's still traumatized by the last shot he missed during the Finals Game 6 . He should stay on the bench like a kinda Juwan Howard & let TP and Khawi lead the team. instead of lowering his career stats.
Princess Luna::Greetings, everyone! I hope everyone is enjoying tonight's wonderful game!
Farkas::O'Casey looking good.
