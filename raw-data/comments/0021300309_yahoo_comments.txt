James Reynaldo::Thomas, Cousins, and Williams had good games.
dreik::What? Sacramento got us? We're not in 2002 aren't we?!
fup duck::I really like how Dirk is playing right now, very controlled and intelligent, but I'm surprised by the sloppy play of Calderon and Marion.
John Michael::I really hope that Isiah,BMac,Derrick,Gay,and Demarcus will start. Their outside defense will improve even if Gay will be a stretch PF and Derrick williams aill learn from him too.
PKM::What team will Sacramento trade Rudy Gay to next?
steve::Seth, Williams did this once in awhile, but #$%$ the bed too often.  He was given his chance and failed.  Sacramento, D Will, and Gay will go nowhere.
Bjetlog17::I'm expecting a great game from Thomas/Cousins and Im  a Mavs fan.
xxkeanxx::@Anton  he's not a junior.. and he's not the son of Isiah Thomas.. lol They are not related at all.. but he was name after Isiah by his father.. but with a different spelling of Isaiah..
Darrell::0 points for jammer. just fire this A-wipe already!
GoHorns::The only two nba stars I respect in the last 35 years..... is Dirk and Hakeem... neither needed another all-star level player to win the champsionship... they both LED their teams to a championship... wish I could say the same of kobe and lefraud james...
