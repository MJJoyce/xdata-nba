Michael::NIT material.
Cyril::I'd be willing to give Stevens my vote for Coach of the Year just for transforming Jordan Crawford into a fairly unselfish player.  His shot selection and decision-making have improved tremendously since the end of last year.
BigBear::Check their +/- ratings ; 2nd win produced by the 2nd Unit. Draw your own conclusions.
MobDad::Interesting lineup for the Celtics.  4 power forwards and a shooting guard.
Knickschamp Tumblr Com::when I talk to ceptics fans they always brag about their championship trophies, yep they got a lot of those but check the date most of it was in the 50s when there are only 10 teams in the NBA. lol
Mel::Danny Ainge is a genius!  Who would have bet that the Celts would be a game and half ahead of Brooklyn at this point..
William::The Celtics are playing pretty good the last 2 games. We still have a long way to go but, atleast we are developing young players. I am looking forward to when Rondo comes back. I want to see us contend every game this year. Just set the groundwork for next season. Ainge will make some moves next year! Way to go Celtics. Good team win!
RedtongKid::Win this one again Celtics!!!
Anton::Celtics just might make the playoffs omg...
Wood Dash E::Why does Ben Gordon never play??
