Malicong::Want to know whats wrong with the Kings? Just look at the shot distribution. Thompson got 10 FG attempts because of his 6 offensive boards. Otherwise, it was Thomas, Thomas, Thomas, Cousins, Cousins, Cousins, Thomas, Thomas, Thomas. Becomes a little easier to beat a team when you only have to worry about 1 or 2 players and not a team. The Kings have to many quality guys to be this bad. Could it be coaching or is this group of players just not equipped to be successful playing together?
daniel::Thank god Marcus Thornton had 2 rebounds and 3 assists, or he would have tied the worst 20 minutes in NBA history...
Guest::There is a genius running around named Andrew (disguised as a power ranger) He likes to let everyone know that they don't anything about basketball. You would think that someone as smart as him would know a simple fact about MJ. He was politely explaining to Max yesterday that MJ never lost in the finals. He went 5-0 to win 5 championships. Kids a genius isn't he?
ThirdyDot::This is how should Durant play, not too much FG and distribute more (aka trust) to his team mates. Yes, with his big score in high FG attempts could win them games but in the long run it would be physically tiring for him when the playoff comes not to mentioned that his team mates are less utilized and also will not be able to compete at a higher level when playoff comes.
Hands Up::Just because Perkins won a ring with Celts doesn't mean he's good. Highly overrated and waste of salary.
Jay Jay::Isiah Thomas best last pick in the nba draft ever...
Drew::I bet Adams gets Cousins ejected. Cousins is a big hot head and Adams has a knack for p(i)ssing people off.
Guest::Easy peasy japanesey. Well played OKC.
Scott::Thunder is getting their groove back.
SwiftyLazer::Not looking good right meow for my Kings ///
