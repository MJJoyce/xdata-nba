olboney1::Isaiah Thomas is outplaying Fredette. He looked just as good as Irving in this game!
brandon 201222::KYRIE OR WESTBROOK?
MrLumpz::Could u imagine Kyrie and Durant on the same team?
brandon 201222::KYRIE AND TRISTAN BEST DRAFT THE CAVS HAS HAD IN A WHILE
brandon 201222::ARE THE CAVS THE NXT OKC THUNDER?
MrLumpz::K. Irving has some guts str8 up! You know that one guy who used to play for the Cavs would have missed 1 or maybe even 2 of those free throws.
spong3bobrox::We gonna have to play better defense for our remaining games. Anyway, GO CAVS!!!
CandySparker::Oh Kyrie Irving!
TheRubioLoveConnection::Kyrie Irving is in no way a PG....1 assist? Are you kidding me...
Doc 04::You do know he played SG for more than half of the game right? Whenever Sessions is on the floor with him he plays SG, but I wouldnt expect haters to even watch any NBA games lmao
swoosh212396::He's winning more game for his team than Rubio! If the Cavs had K.Love we would be way better than the Wolves are now!
BuckeyeheadKyle::If the Cav's had Kevin Love, Varejao wasn't hurt, we would easily be a 24-5 team right now.
iCandid::Oh man he's averaging one less assist then Derrick Rose was his first two seasons in 8 less minutes.  Not a PG at all.
ricky2213::do u watch the games? its not his fault he has no scorers who cant hit wide open shots. i think hes starting to lose confidence in them a bit..hes still averaging about 5 assists pg with these players..sorry he cant have kevin love on his team..he is a future top 5 pg
CTownHiLo::who cares - the kid is playing very good ball. Always under control and makes good decisions especially for a rook. If you notice inthe 4th they ran plenty of plays with Sessions playing point. Not sure what Kyrie is (pg, or off guard or what) but hes a sweet player with tremendous upside.
RayKrebbs1978::Well It looked for sure like the Cavs were going to blow that one.  thankfully they caught a break.  check this out - http://www.lakecounty-sentinel.com/index.php?p=51_29
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::I'm out. GG Cavs and GL in the future. GN to whoever is here, GO KINGS!
BuckeyeheadKyle::I'm so glad Tristian Thompson is doing very well all of a sudden. Many people were calling him a bust, but I think he just needed time to mature and develop his game.
BuckeyeheadKyle::TT I think will blossom very well next year.
CTownHiLo::too early to tell with TT. He was injured and the last several games still didn't his normal pop in the legs. He looked healthy in this game. Time will tell but I still see him as a double double guy even if he doesnt pan out. If he does then hes a 17 -10 guy or more.
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::he looked good today
theotherguy76::What I like about the Cavs this year is that for the most part, they beat teams that they are suppose to beat! Rejoice my fellow cavs fans, I think we are going in right direction!!!
CTownHiLo::wow Robert - what a sorry life you lead. The highlight of your day is trolling a cavs board - long after the media spotlght moved on? I'm a cavs fan so at least I have a reason to be here but you? Man, get a life!
Robert24907::yes get irving ready to leave in a few years,the nba thanks u.
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::congrats
brandon 201222::IM OUT PEACE CAVS NATION
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::gn and happy b-day
TyrekeTheKing13::good game cavs it was a close game nice to see some great production from IT
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::yep, I just wish jimmer had time over Thornton because Marcus is just off.
gwbushwetsthebed::Looks like IT got the better of that one. Bet Terrence Ross noticed that.
gwbushwetsthebed::Didn't have to think too hard, came pretty easy.
brandon 201222::COOL SCREEN NAME LOL
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::agreed
shockerbd::Last pick in the draft Isaiah Thomas outplayed the number one pick in the draft!!!!!  Any of us who watched him at Curtis High or the UW are not surprised! Great game Isaiah!
Bits-N-Kibbles::Isaiah Thomas is a beast.  You can't stop talent and a heart like that. I wish he was still playing at UW, but it is good to see he is having success even though he was undermined in the draft.  Cold Blooded! Maybe Thomas and the Kings will make their way back to Seattle (Sonics) in the next five years.
zabueteen0606::stats are for losers. Wins say it all. IT is a great player dont get me wrong but he will never amount to what Kyrie will be
Astrohusky::Cav fan talking about wins?  Pardon me while I go to another room to respectfully laugh my a$$ off.
griffin1391::how did he outplay him? We won...
JBurhenn253::Wins and losses are a team stat. Don't be ridiculous look at the stat lines.
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::def better than the 60th pick
brandon 201222::it is officialy by birthday i will congradulate myself now lol
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::happy birthday, congrats
brandon 201222::THANKS MAN
brandon 201222::any on see KD drop 51 2night and westbrook drop 40 tht was crazzzy
Astrohusky::Want my damn Sonics back!
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::don't forget Ibaka with a triple double that included 11 blocks.
brandon 201222::i know ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ESPN CALM DOWN ON LIN DAM
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::I don't hate lin, but I want him to lose because he is so overhyped
brandon 201222::it was cool for a lil but not im sick of it
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::exactly
brandon 201222::ik tht lin shittttt is out of control
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::I know, and they still talk about lin more
brandon 201222::ik tht $@%!$ was crazzy!!!
chenkowski::It's fun to talk to real Cavs fans. I live in VA so I have to put up with Bobcats and Wizards fans all the time. I've got to talk some trash this year to them :)
NWptown::good game IT, almost a triple-double thur
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::yep
TheTristanShow::GN everyone. Always great talking about the Cavs!
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::gn and gl to your cavs
brandon 201222::by man talk to u next ur on here peace
brandon 201222::hey king george are u on here after every cavs game?
KingGeorge53::No.    But I try to.
brandon 201222::just wonderin i see u on here a lot
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::I was looking for "An annoying hype machine that is more TMZ &amp; Fox News than it is a sports channel, and racist", but you guys were close
KingGeorge53::What?   I thought we had a fairly civil conversation.
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::GN, good chatting with you and the other Cavs fans. GL to your cavs
KingGeorge53::oh... it's getting too late.  Good chatting with you Aztec.    Sincerely, best wishes to you and your Kings.    I need to get some beauty sleep.
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::That was the answer to "ESPN is ______?" I'm still civil
yata9arasu::Good night everyone(especially KingGeorge.)  Good luck to the Kings this season!  Go Cavs!
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::gn and gl to the cavs
KingGeorge53::I'll be following you out the door my friend.   See you Tuesday.
brandon 201222::did they say tht gibson was out tuesday?
KingGeorge53::Is anyone wondering what Ira Newble is doing these days?
KingGeorge53::Really?    Where?   and I bet he's a D coach.
TheTristanShow::In Canton for the Charge. I remember reading about that.
TheTristanShow::He's an assistant coach!
yata9arasu::I can't wait until baseball season....  :D  Should be interesting!
yata9arasu::HECK YEAH!
KingGeorge53::Pitchers and catchers tomorrow Yata!!!!!
TheTristanShow::Is it too late to get our second round pick back for Harangody and Erden?
KingGeorge53::lol   I will say this, at least Erden has potential.   Potential as a back up.  Harangody is too small for the PF and too slow for the SF.    Kind of reminds me of that kid that played "Rudy".
KingGeorge53::Too much booze or shizzle is all I can think of.
TheTristanShow::Doesn't have enough of a jump shot to be dangerous either.. I wonder what the mindset was for the Celtics when they drafted him.
brandon 201222::ha lol i dont like either of them
brandon 201222::ya they both are bench warmers pretty much erden is only playin cause we aint got a true big man
TheTristanShow::Yeah. A risk that just doesn't look like it will pay off.
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::ESPN is _________?
KingGeorge53::lin'ed up
TheTristanShow::racist.
brandon 201222::overating lin
yata9arasu::Jamison is such a good guy and class act....  I hope he wins a title at least once.  Really deserves it....  He seems to be happy to just play no matter what team it is.
KingGeorge53::That's right on the mark yata.    I really think he's been good for this team.    So ironic that he was what James wanted.   Only played with James for a couple months, but it's Jamison that shows these young players what class is all about.
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::the highlight was about 1 min long and they didn't even mention IT smfh
1mproperDancing::Welcome to being a small market sports fan.  You never get the proper respect.
KingGeorge53::I almost hit the flag button cause it's that disgusting... lol
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::lol
chenkowski::Its automatic that Kyrie is going to be Rookie of the Year. But Byron Scott deserves some Coach of the Year votes. He's such a great coach for young teams.
KingGeorge53::It's early chen... there's a lot of good rookie PG imho this year.    With all the time left, there's time for someone like TT (or a few others on other teams) that possibly can fit the bill.  But Scott.   Oh man.     When I looked at the line-up prior to the season, I thought for sure we'd have more ping pong balls than anyone.
KingGeorge53::I'll go along with that chenkowski.
Sternis-a-dbag::no he's not
brownsjoe::trade sessions for who??
duckconfit::how about to dallas for lamar odom?
1mproperDancing::I think the Lakers are still interested, but they're waiting to see how the Dwight Howard saga plays out.
DyersEve06::Sessions won't fix the Lakers' problems but I'll take a first rounder for him
chenkowski::The Knicks were the main trade partner for a while until Linsanity ruined it.
TheTristanShow::I thought Sessions to LA for Steve Blake and a first rounder would be nice but LA isn't interested anymore.
KingGeorge53::they also don't have anything about 22 at this point.
chenkowski::1st round pick
brownsjoe::to a bad team
billyblackwood::Good game Supersonics, just came up a little short this time!
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::not the supersonics damn it
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::stop it
brownsjoe::will be
brandon 201222::CAVS FUTURE ROSTER pg: kyrie irving sg: insert a player we draft  sf: alonzo gee pf:tristan thompson c: anderson varageo im not sure how to spell his last name lol 6th man: daniel gibson
DyersEve06::Barnes
KingGeorge53::He's a SF, but I wouldn't mind trying him out.     All I'm saying is we MUST get an impact player out of one of these SG/SF/C.    If we hit 2 of those then having Gee at the SF would be fine.    Or...    If we get Barnes and Leonard then we can do with the combination of bo.obie and Gee at the two spot.
KingGeorge53::How's this?  PG Kyrie SG  Jeremy Lamb SF  alonzo gee pf TT C  Myers Leonard
1mproperDancing::Hibbert is a restricted free agent this year.  Not sure what his actual value is, though, but the Cavs would obviously have to overpay.
brandon 201222::we could use free angency for a center. are ther any good free agent centers though?
KingGeorge53::brandon... we need a C badly.    Here's why I like him.    He's a real C at 7',  good motor, can pass and hit a jumper.    Those attributes are very important for the kind of Offense we run... Princeton O.
yata9arasu::I REALLY LIKE LAMB!  Could develop into a great shooter like Ray Allen/Richard Hamilton type.  Leonard is nice because he is true center.
KingGeorge53::oh... and the Wild Thing as the 6th man.
brandon 201222::i love jeremy lamb but i dont really like leonard
Sternis-a-dbag::is that line up supposed to make cavs fans feel better?
1mproperDancing::Hopefully we upgrade small forward a bit more than Alonzo Gee as our starter.  I like the kid, but I'd much rather see him come off the bench at the two and three as a defensive stopper and energy guy.
KingGeorge53::He'd be fine if we pick up a SG and C like I noted below
TheTristanShow::Hopefully Gee isn't the starting SF... He'll be a great role player on our future playoff team but as a starter... I don't know.
brownsjoe::boobie
brandon 201222::ya i realized tht lol
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::jugs gibson?
yata9arasu::Anderson Varejao.
brownsjoe::i recorded this game because i wasnt home and it didnt show the last 2.9 seconds i was mad and thought we lost until i went to the computer and went crazy
Sternis-a-dbag::hahahahaha even better
brownsjoe::and i always text/type like ths
Sternis-a-dbag::loving that Cleveland educational system, good come back
brownsjoe::i live in LA
Sternis-a-dbag::no one cares $@%!$@%
brownsjoe::no wonder ur a dbag
tyande01::South Beach is a cool city....
KingGeorge53::When I was there last may for a freaking wedding, it was always in the upper 90s.     I can't ice fish in that kind of weather.
billyblackwood::I think this shows that Isaiah Thomas needs to be an everyday starter. I still remember the early game where he shut down Kobrick cold. Only going to get better.
yata9arasu::I really thought Evans would be a top 10 player based off his first season....  Still has time.
KingGeorge53::the strange thing is Evans has more talent in his little pinkie then at least 75% of NBA players.    IMHO he's wasting it.
TheTristanShow::sorry wrong post.
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::Yes sir, would love to have him and jimmer start some games with Evans at sf.
chenkowski::This time last year the Cavs turned to JJ Hickson to be the leader and he just didn't care. Now we have a true leader for the next decade in Kyrie
brownsjoe::hopefully he doesnt make any decisions if u know what i mean
Bruno0341::Like the King's decision to become the Super Sonic's in a year or two
brownsjoe::jman i live in LA i dont even live in cleveland
TheTristanShow::I wish the Kings would play Hickson more.
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::I wish they would play jimmer more
KingGeorge53::I think they discovered what we knew... he has Drew Gooden disease.   Can't remember the plays.
brownsjoe::tri[stan needs to put more arc on his shot hes to flat
KingGeorge53::Sounds like my first GF
billyblackwood::IT put in some work!! too bad his team mates could not help him get the win.
KingGeorge53::It was an outstanding game.   But if he keeps it up, your team is going to win more than lose.     This was his first start right?
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::I'm sorry, I had to foul because I suck -T Evans
jman_5000::No Cleveland sports team has had a great player since Jim Brown.
1mproperDancing::We had one that left a few years ago.  You may have seen a few news stories about it.  And it's looking like we've got another one now.
KingGeorge53::don't do the troll's HW.
KingGeorge53::You need to sharpen up your google
jman_5000::What do Cleveland and the middle east have in common? Nobody goes there unless they have to.
KingGeorge53::I've learned how to click the flag thingie.
yata9arasu::..............  Wow......  Lol....  Fail...
brownsjoe::good1 i think you made everyones day here... gah
jman_5000::You're just mad because it's true.
brandon 201222::HATER!!!!!!!!!!!!
TheTristanShow::You've gotta learn to be funny man...
AztecsChargersKingsPadresFan::sorry had to use it
brownsjoe::dont mind
KingGeorge53::Hey.   It works as well.    I'm telling you, if this kid can keep it up, you've solved your PG problems for a long time.
brownsjoe::if tristan made half of his FTs he would of had 50 points but he had a great game otherwise good draft cavs!
KingGeorge53::I'd settle for a Howard/Shaq look-a-like
TheTristanShow::His free throws have looked better lately!
brownsjoe::not tonight hes flat
chenkowski::I love the type of players Chris Grant and Dan Gilbert are drafting and signing. High character guys who don't put themselves ahead of the team and hustle every game. Something the Kings need to learn.
KingGeorge53::When you think of it.   The Cavs had ZERO picks after the decision.   None.     We ended up with Sessions... well you know the rest.   But man in the course of one year, drastically changed the course of this franchise.
