George::What is the worst shooting percentage in the HISTORY of the NBA for a strarting PG?? Brandon Jennings that is a record i wouldn't wanna own.
Tony Anthony::This is ridiculous. Why is Josh Smith hitting all his jumpers?
The Snowman 9913::Free throws killed Washington.  You have to make them, they missed 13, lost by 6...
Hennrik::On paper detroit has a playoff team, they just need play as a team, and a coach that can make the hard decisions. Just becuase your paying Josh Smith a small fortune to play does not mean he has to play if he's doing it poorly.  Using the same stating lineup that played like s**t the other night, is not the way to win, make player work for there spot.
Cyril::Monroe and Drummond - 10-13 combined shooting.  Jennings - 4-13 shooting. What a joke of a point guard. There is no excuse for him to take more shots than both his big men when he's barely shooting 30%. Monroe needs more than 7 touches in a game, for crying out loud!  If Singler hadn't gone off for a huge game, this would have been a double-digit loss.
Hennrik::much love for the Pistons, but is it bad when i would rather go to bed then watch this game, and Jennings just passed a fan in the crowd.
srilatha::HOW does 0:00 not count as a DNP
Word::Who else thinks the Pistons would be better if they started Bynum, Stuckey, and Singler instead of Jennings, KCP, and Smith?
Old Pro::These aren't you're grandmother's Wizards.
Amir::Good day to go over .500, Nene to have good game
