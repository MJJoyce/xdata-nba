TheSportsDude2011::Is Tyronne Lue a coach now? He's been sitting on the bench for a loooong time..
TheSportsDude2011::Got it, thanks to wiki, he now works for the boston celtics as a director! WOW way to go Lue!
LifeIsABoxOfChocolate::"Celtics are garbage"  Larry Bird
Dribbird::LOL at Knicks fans thinking they are better than Boston.
Elton7323::knicks are beter than boston lol u guys got hot at the right time before u almost lost your 8 seed spot.
nba is the worst::Way to start the road B2B2B - and the Nets looked good vs the tanking 76ers.  What are the Celtics doing?
Gilchrest89::Bad loss for the C's!  Gotta take care of business against one of the worst teams in the league. But, let's face it, it's hard to get up emotionally for the worst teams in the league and the C's always have their eye on the bigger prize.
Chicagocold312::Oh well here we go again making these knucklehead analyst looking dumb again, they just hopped on the Celtics jock to go to the ECF and they turn around and lose to the raptors? Truth be told they're tough but they (Boston) are still supposed to come away with the win.
Dwayne_Johnson23::I like it more when we win
Christo677::Ive been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar for a few months now. I have made over 3k a month for 3 consecutive months just following this system. It's on the 1st page of Google when you search the words "sports betting system" Thought I would post this for anyone that's looking for a betting system that actually works.

Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Better than dropping one to the Knicks.  Get em tomorrow, Celtics.
New_York_For_The_Win::LMAO. Boston sucks big time LOL
ShaneKY23::When toronto beats Boston, only the meth heads here freak out and use all caps WHEN THEY SPEAK.  That is funny, it is a win and only a win. Please come back and talk to me when they win something more meaning...like a championship.
bradonlywins::PAUL PIERCE IS SUCH A FAT LOSERRRRRRRR
thenbatmm::Matt Barnes Postgame Interview!!!  PLAYER of the game!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY3ruLx1bKg
LeggoLaL::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giy5vzPmGbY sleep well celts fans. ! LOL
ronbo 236::I had to come here to this board because the Heat and Bobcat board was boring as hell but what do you expect from teams heading in the same direction...May I ask how the hell the Celtics lost to the Toronto rapers whoops I mean Raptors my bad...I guess Boston figured they would take the night off and rest up for the next game!!
LeggoLaL::Sox s.uck Celts s.uck Pats s.uck
renelle054::When the Raptors are going to get in the play-offs?  I like the Raptors. They don't want to be in the play-offs and ruin their summer working. So the Raptors do this every year. To show their fans they can beat a play-off teams. They beat a play off team when a play off team let their quard down. Shame on them. I am convienced the Raptors don't want to play in the play-off because they have too many international players  that want to represent their teams in the international games. Thats ok. I hope you show your fans one day you can enter the play-offs. Your fans love you!
LeggoLaL::nothing makes sense to a KenSuc.ky fan Lol
renelle054::To you!
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::This doesn't make any sense.
Flop City::Who has the tie breaker between the celtics and pacers?
Flop City::I haven't looked at the Pacers/Hawks schedule.
masterjoe712::Yeah 2-1 I am more worried about them then the Celtics
Flop City::Hawks have the tiebreaker over Pacers?
masterjoe712::The hawks though have the tie breaker and they are only 2 games back
masterjoe712::Its tied 2-2
Flop City::Hmmmm. What is the next tie breaker?
Ke121989::ECF First round- Bulls 4 Knicks 0, Heat 4 Sixers 0, Pacers 4 Hawks 2, Celtics 4 Magic 2  Second round- Heat 4 Pacers 1, Bulls 4 Celtics 2  ECF- Heat 4, Bulls 2
Lets Go Miami Heat::I think bosh will show up in the playoffs. Wade is my favorite player for the heat and is the heat but he needs to step up. Same with the bench though if they want to win this year the bench needs to work harder. Lebron, Wade and Bosh play a lot and need a break. Hopefully we can pull a win out through the celtics and the bulls.
spicerichards::Heat lose in the second round, team blows up...Bosh gets his walking papers, Bron and Wade win gold, and maybe...just maybe they win it in a full stretch year.  Not a hater, just a realist.
53Kevin::ECF-Bulls 4,Heat 1
Ke121989::NBA Finals- Heat 4, Thunder 2
spicerichards::West 4 - Heat 2...  Yay!
