mnsportswopwopwahhh::This is the year!
SotaBoy4Life::Hopefully the Wolves make a smart trade that puts us over the top.
Rubio is not Blondie::Smart and Kahn......oxymoron
mnsportswopwopwtfespn::Yeah Love is definitely the best PF in the game with that performance
Rubio is not Blondie::If he can keep up at this level, there is no doubt.
mnsportswopwopwtfespn::Don't look now, but Wes has been consistently productive over the past 2 games.  Beasley is the odd man out per usual so we will see if David Kahn can be a quality GM.
B1ouin::Wes Johnson "consistent", that's a first time I've heard that.
Rubio is not Blondie::The fact that they are offering Beasley to other teams comes to show how much trust does the franchise has on him. I wish he could put his $@%! together because he could be a great asset
slo1111::I'm glad to see martel have a good game.  Some times he pisses me off beyond belief, but he is very atheletic and fun to watch when he is on.  Between he and beasely if we could just get either or on any given night that would be big help get us above 500.  Doesn't address our guard problems though, damn.  I guess when one considers that Adleman loves the 3 guard set and we don't have 3 guards we can use that is going to win us games any given night, it is nice to see he can make it work with what we do have.  We need to bust through this 500 barrier though and somehow get int he position of not having to look back.
PhilMNAP::You mean our SG problem right? Rubio is a capable PG.
mn_tanz::I think he'll be better than 40% next year.  That really isn't much better than where he is now, and it really isn't all that good anyway.
Rubio is not Blondie::in 2 years Ricky will be a &gt;40% shooter for sure. His mechanics are good, he just need to automatize a couple of things to speed up his delivery
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::that would be great
PhilMNAP::Yes. He does everything well besides his shot. I hope he can get better in the offseason.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::more than capable
minny snowta::Good game Wolves! It was really back and forth but Minny pulled it out with a 12 point beatdown.  Love definitely owns Aldridge, Love's 42 points, 10 reb. verses Lamarcus' 14 and 7 shows it and Aldridge got booted from the game.  I'm glad we get to play the jailblazers 3 more times this season, hopefully Potland can help boost us into the playoffs.  Anywho, great game Love, good game Martell and DWill.  Rubio needs to work on his shot and Beasley needs to take care of the ball and stop stroking his teammates knees.
ibnfrey::Go wolves! :)
jdragovich::Going to the game vs Golden State on April 4th. Can't wait. Fun team to watch.
Blitzbolt::The Wolves remind me of the Thunder(3years ago)and Grizzlies (2 years ago)They all have young guys that are taking steps every year.
JR.Taylor34::you are wrong, the thunder (3 years ago) and grizzlies (2 years ago) remind you of the wolves today
Frenchyboy97::I'll bring my knowledge of the schlong bong with me.
Frenchyboy97::I'm ready to join the t-wolves bandwagon.
Frenchyboy97::Schlong bong
TheKingOfVa360::The Wolves are so close to that 8th spot in the playoffs, this team is so fun to watch!!
esco7277::Butt Crack &gt; Trailblazers
CandySparker::Hola Lotta Love!
spurs_sweep::wow, where did all those blazer fans go? Not talking any crap now after the griz almsot score 40 points twice in 4 quarters with your "starters" on the floor. Pathetic, next time try saying thank you when a team like San Antonio sits their startes down instead of trashing you by 50. Losers
blazers3333333::time to do another line dude. you're crashin hard
TayCarson::Total hypocrisy. You stay classy
log jamming::wolves too good
markos kolioulis::id take kevin love on the bulls over blake griffin any day of the week
ibnfrey::yes
kcnym11::no
BCfans2::clean house this year and sell the team next year. Paul Allen doesn't care about the blazer fans. Just his jewels and $$$$
Bricky Rubio is 373rd In The League In FG Percentage::My name is a lie.   Bricky is now 380th in the league in FG%.   HAHAHAAH BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRICKY!!
SotaBoy4Life::He makes it up with assists and steals.
jonnyd_94::let him have his fun.  doesn't matter.  Jealousy is a stinky cologne
TheKingOfVa360::As long as we keep winning who cares moron
WorldSeriesTwins88::Difference is, Ricky won, Kyrie lost.
MNfreakTim::he is also 2nd in steals in the entire league and 5th in assists. how many stats does Kyrie rank in the top 5 in the league again?
BCfans2::Create a new persona. Dip S**t
Bricky Rubio is 373rd In The League In FG Percentage::HE IS 380TH OUT OF 444 PLAYERS LISTED!!!!!!!!!!
Minnesota.Legends::I think its fair to say you can put any Aldrige vs Love comparisons to rest now...  KLOVE&gt;&gt;&gt;Aldrige <b> Factdiggity</b>
Bricky Rubio is 373rd In The League In FG Percentage::HAHAHAHAHAHA  BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRICCCCKY 12% AGAIN!!!!!!! HAHAHAAHAH  NOW THE MEDIA HAS CAUGHT ON: http://www.rotoworld.com/content/playerpages/playerbreakingnews.asp?sport=NBA&amp;id=1596&amp;line=173616&amp;spln=1  http://www.startribune.com/sports/wolves/141258453.html  HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH  BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIICKY
minny snowta::get a life bro! we know you secretly have a man crush on ricky!
Lovemymom21::franchise record assists in a quarter, you forget about that stat tonight?
Diamondslugz::Half of those assists are on 3 point shots... Should not count 3 point shots as assists... Rubio is lucky he is on a team that can shoot.
58rhodes::Blazers new slogan Fall with us
meats29::Love had 0 turnovers as well
Dinomeyt::Thats amazing. He is usually TO prone. I feel sad for Ricky. He got so many hits to the face in that game. They were just attacking him
toshsghost::Anybody follow the Hawks close enough to know if they can trade Josh Smith / or would want to?  What about if the Lake Show sends Gasol &amp; whatever to the Hawks for J. Smith and Heinreich?  I'd like to see that line with Bynum, Smith, Kobe, and Heinreich running the point.  And the Hawks should know by now that J. Smith and Joe Johnson just ain't cutting the mustard.  If they had Gasol would Joe Johnson become a scoring machine like Kobe?  Cause he can light it up when healthy
meats29::The Wolves are going to have a bandwagon soon.
T-Wolves12::Bandwagon has to be my least favorite word in sports, hope the Wolves keep winning, but I hate bandwagon fans with a passion
TheKingOfVa360::If we can get Bantum next year, get rid of Wes......we're solid!
crossovr11::Dude if you haven't already gotten on the bandwagon, you're missing out! I'm not saying I'm on the bandwagon, because I'm actually a Twolves fan ever since I knew who Kevin Garnett, Malik S, and Spreewell were. BTW, RIP Sealy; for ever in our hearts
Dinomeyt::I can see that. If we can beat LAL friday, we are the midwest LAC of the NBA
Dinomeyt::Indeed, some players need to go (wes, beasley: his handling of the ball was a disgrace)
meats29::It's just like any up and coming young team. They eventually get a bandwagon following. Nothing bad about it. They are a fun team to watch and since K-Love is a fellow Bruin i am glad he is doing well. Good things are happening in Minnesota. They just have to keep the core together. Even after Kahn screwed up all of those draft picks a few years ago it's all working out now.
Dinomeyt::Just beating the lakers would be a positive. We know we can beat the clippers and the blazers, but if we can show that we can beat Bryant, this team will be seen as a dangerous foe
Dinomeyt::Portland, where if ur center isn't injured, the skin on his chin opens up or he is perceived as a jerk for teabagging another player
golden state ITALY fan::WHY NUGGETS ARE HAPPY :) WHEN felton GO TO portland ??????????????????????
crossovr11::unforunately no he/she isn't.
BCfans2::Drink Much?
B1ouin::Even though Wes Johnson is starting, he isn't playing that much. That's definitely a good thing. That $@% needs to take a seat on his living room couch, he doesn't even deserve the bench or the D League.
BCfans2::Who the $@%! is Wes Johnson? why post that $@%!
thewolf1616::gnight wolve fans....see ya next game
B1ouin::Raymond Felton needs to get his $@% in the gym. That overweight $@% is holding the Blazers down.
