zwezzy::lol the conversation has 666 comments...well i guess it doesn't now =/
Permanot::Allez les Wolves, gardez confiance !
Rip City Forever::You guys picked up Chris Johnson? Although we only had him briefly, that is another blazer to continue the trend lol but I like him a lot that's a good pick up for you guys
Minnysota Vikings::I really like him. Easily the most athletic player on the team, plus he seems to have a good feel for the game which is something that Derrick Williams DOESN'T have. I hope his minutes pick up soon.
MinniWolves90::RICKY. IS. BACK.
Rip City Forever::Good to hear happy for ya. 9 and 7 in 23 minutes that's good production
Minnysota Vikings::He drove to the basket with authority tonight. You knew once he gained back confidence in his knee that everything else would follow.
ImAWitness06::Why Cris Carter got in HOF(Sportsnation freestyle rap)  http://www.youtube.com/#/watch?v=eOjbPXs6f8M&amp;feature=relmfu&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Ffeature%3Drelmfu%26v%3DeOjbPXs6f8M
Grindhouse2413::Good job Dante. We miss you in Memphis man. Good win MIN
Minnysota Vikings::Chris Johnson is by far the most efficient player on the Wolves and yet he once again got only 8 minutes. Come on Adelman! Unleeaaasshhhh!!!!
Viktor1313::He won't be as effective if he doesn't control his fouls, 5 fouls in 11 min, don't get me wrong I think he is the best thing that happened to the wolves in a long time.
CTSmithy::If the Twolves start to turn things around, I credit myself since I was at this game.
relentlessind127::hopefully this is the start of a turn around.  Been saying this for awhile just get around the .500 mark when you start getting budinger and some people back and with a month left i think we could rattle off a win streak but i give us about a 1% chance of making the playoffs at this point
Genghis Kittah::Good to see Derrick Williams is getting playing time...
MNSUmavs15::he couldnt hold onto the ball tonight he deserve the playing time he got... i was at the game he wasnt really into the game
Twinstime 35::He is only 22. Give him some time in this lost season and see what you got.
Wcanal170::Bust
brooklynnets7::Hopefully one of these teams gets the 1st overall pick next year.
Minnysota Vikings::Hopefully a great performance like this will create some positive vibes in the locker room and carry through to the next game against the Blazers.

Tyler BarnesMNSports::Do you think he will be the same?
Minnysota Vikings::Knicks are rumored to be interested in Amundson with Sheed going out, but I don't see how we part with him unless the Knicks are willing to give up 1st round picks for the next 3 years.
