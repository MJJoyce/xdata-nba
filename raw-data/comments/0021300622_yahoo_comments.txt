KHAR T::Chicago is a mystery. Missing palyers due to injuries all the time they still manage to win the games. The main reason for this they never give up playing defense. This is their base and they stick with it.
andrew::Cavs are just bad. How can you shoot 37% and call yourself a professional team?
Cj::why haven't the sorry @#$ cavs sent Bennett to the D league.  No playing time is just increasing his inability to play.  Whomever drafted his sorry butt needs to be fired and publically humiliated...like us fans are every night.  he has committed grand theft excepting his paycheck!  As has the coach and GM.
Vincent::I would bet Luol wishes he was still in Chicago he's a rental for 40 more. Nice win for the Bulls considering the different lineups they throw out there each night. 9 of 11 helps at the half way point.
Kevin::No booze, no problem? I think he signs elsewhere and they let Gibson start next year...
Larry::Noah just never stops hustling and just makes everyone around him play better. Unreal rebounder, defender and passer and he just always is trying to get better. My favorite Bulls player since MJ.
usc2::Last 3 years, the Cavs were able to have 2x #1 picks, 2x #4 picks, and a #17 pick.  With this management, they might as well name their team the Cleveland Rebuilders
donald::This is what happens when you put Dunleavy in the starting lineup and just let him play.
Lawrence::Since the Cavs GM refuses to fire dummy Brown, would someone fit him with cement boots and take him on a boat ride on Lake Erie. Thanks.
Larry::Man just put 2 high quality players around Noah and Da Bulls are back!
