Cyril::Maybe it's just me, but I really like both of these teams.  They are staying competitive and so far surpassing expectations after losing their supposed "franchise" players.  Orlando has gone out and picked up guys like Nik Vucevic, Arron Afflalo, and Tobias Harris who were being undervalued on their previous teams, and more importantly, they have given them the opportunity to develop.  Both teams have turned overlooked players like DeMarre Carroll and E'Twaun Moore into reliable producers, and they've made smart late-round draft picks with guys like Andrew Nicholson and Mike Scott.  Teague has emerged as arguably the best point guard in the East so far this year, and Vucevic is a top 5 center in his conference.  These teams are doing things the right way, and up to this point they are both being rewarded for it.
Joey P::One TO from Oladipo. I hope that is a sign of things to come.
jason::Nicholson must have been getting too many points and rebounds,  back to the bench he goes.  You sit there young man and think about what you did,  how dare you play that well.
dc::I know that he is off an injury, but thus far, Lou Williams looks awful.
PKM::Big Baby time?
Commenter::Oladipo is going to be a great one...
dc::Hawks should have just stayed in the dressing room at half.  Nice second half meltdown...again.  Rockets will kill us tomorrow.
CYRUS C::The Magics are deep with young talent. Afflalo,Moore and Oladipo at the 2's. SF you can use Harkless,Harris and bigs in Davis, Maxiell, Nicholson, Vucevic. Nelson just needs a better backup than Price,who sucks....
RONZO::Why is Turkoglu still playing for the Tragic.. Been over a year since his last game. Get rid of this low performance bum!
bob Z::The Magic need to keep playing a consistent line up. Otherwise helterskelter.
