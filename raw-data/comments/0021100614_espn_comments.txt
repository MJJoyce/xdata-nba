threetimechamp210::Spurs keep winning! Parker lives in the paint, 31 pts.!  Duncan, you da man!
nanopm::Spurs are awesome wizards suck.
catalina kid::what the hell happened to trevor booker today why only 3 rebounds
PutYouOn::ahahahaha who cares
truesportfanman::So san antone, you pulled one out over the wizards, well the LAKERS are coming after you for that 2 spot, Better watch out.
Julian_h_Lyon::Lakers should worry about competing with the best team in LA imo
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::Compete against themselves ? what ever for ?
MadddSammyboy::The Lakers are a huge joke. Nobody's worried about those guys anymore.
Chick Hearn rolling over in his grave::Pacific Division leaders and the 3rd seed, oh no they are so horrible.
MadddSammyboy::Right. Teams lose sometimes. The Spurs lost to an eight-seed last May; the Lakers just had a losing streak against teams with a combined 24% winning percentage last WEEK. Maybe if Laker fans were talking about how terrible and inconsistent their team is instead of running their mouth about 'coming for the #2 seed' after they barely edged a team with a total of five road wins a day ago, people might not be so harsh in their criticism.
Antsea91::Spurs lost to an 8th seed. Enough said.
MadddSammyboy::I'm highly thrilled about the Spurs, yo.
slick0816::D**m, the Wizards suck even at dodgeball
SB47-Locker10::B- Diddy did Tj Ford wrong!! What a dirty player!!

kileykmiec0020::Im crying laughing... JaVale McGee's 8 dumbest plays as a NBA player: http://cosbysweaters.com/2012/03/12/javale-mcgee-top-8-dumb-plays/  Hilarious!!!
crazycucker::dwights demanding orlando trade for nash... could be scary options for trades here http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
CandySparker::Hola Lotta Love!
SPEN206209::10 of 19 FTs --very bad; 30 assists --very good. But Spurs' defense is paltry---allowing 11 out of last 12 opponents 95 points or more. Bulls-        6 out of last 12 opponents scored 95 or more (last four opponents including win over Knicks) Heat-         3 out of last 12 opponents scored 95 or more Thunder-  8 out of last  13 opponents scored 95 or more (4 out of last 5) Lakers-     6 out of last 12 Grizzlies-  7 out of last 13
Spursdc::Manu's injuries started the year he just had to play in the Olympic $@%!
Spursdc::Earlier, I said Tony didn't make the all-star game. Sorry, I was tricked by the Wizards whack $@% announcers
DRWVIKS::why did manu only play 20 minutes

Pb2amontana::Shiiiiiioooooot.
Open-minded Husker::Manu only played 19 minutes and was on the bench down the stretch????  Please don't tell me he got hurt yet again.
Spursdc::it all started that year he was so pressed to play in the Olympic games
lsiberian::He did win a Gold Medal though.
joemcleod83::yeh he was stretching on the side..Doubt its anything serious..good chance he misses a game or two for precaution though
FrankPistachio211::They haven't officially said whether it's a strain or not. We'll find out soon. Let's keep our fingers crossed, because I'm tired of seeing a player with as much talent as Manu being so banged up.
ImOldschool1964::yeah, me too..but whats more alarming is his inability to avoid injury.  I truly believe his body is broken down.
ImOldschool1964::unfortunately yes.
Open-minded Husker::Unreal  ...thanks for the info.  I sure hope it's minor.
ImOldschool1964::Yep, he strained a leg muscle.
Open-minded Husker::Are you serious?  He really did?
masoud_h81::yessssssssssssss........ -13.5 covered
wtops::they lost by 15pts
FrankPistachio211::Good game. Sorry for all of my bi t ch ing, folks. I can't help it.
Spursdc::.
ImOldschool1964::DALLAS sucks..heck we could have beaten them last year..they're nowhere near the team they were last season.  It would be a good thing to match up with them.
Spursdc::Yeah, you have been crazy lately-not just this game.ahaha
FrankPistachio211::I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing.
ImOldschool1964::Look at the bright side, Frank..if the playoffs started today we'd play DALLAS.
omaha_boi_21::wll wizards cover
Spursdc::corey made a play!

FrankPistachio211::Moss to the 49'ers. LMFAO!!
ImOldschool1964::49'ers are a one hit wonder,,,they'll sink into the depths of mediocrity next season
Spursdc::if he is in any kind of shape, they will be dangerous
ImOldschool1964::Spurs better do SOMETHING to get a legit backup pg...joseph sucks.
ImOldschool1964::He's always got that stupid grin on his face....
joemcleod83::yeh he does LOL
FrankPistachio211::LMMFAO!!
joemcleod83::hes not that bad..hes just too young..hes like 12 or 13
SB47-Locker10::Spurs winning playing "BAD GAME"!SMH!

FrankPistachio211::WTF, Blair??
omaha_boi_21::update plz
john163ms40::why did Manu go to the locker room?
FrankPistachio211::Yeah, he'll probably miss 10 more games. This sucks.
ImOldschool1964::Manu just can't stay healthy.
joemcleod83::tight leg muscles prob means 1 to 2 weeks out knowing the cautious popovich
Spursdc::smh. not again
denveraic::Here we go again.
Spursdc::leg injury 2 weeks
FrankPistachio211::His leg muscles were supposedly "tight".
111Mauricejonesdrew111::calvin johnson is a beast right everyone
Spursdc::when he learns to run a route
vaplaya0::Yea but Dez bryant will be better
Spursdc::Even though Tony Parker didn't make the all-star team, he needs to be in the mvp conversation
john163ms40::He was an All Star selection
Spursdc::oh, yeah, sorry
Dirtybearcub::he was in the all star game
FrankPistachio211::What could possibly be beneficial from playing Richard Jefferson?? He's not making shots anymore; he doesn't rebound; he plays no defense.  He's WORTHLESS.
LightningBOLTS_II::play Kawhi more!
1719719719::He was almost amnestied stuff like that hurts a players feelings, just look at Gasol.
FrankPistachio211::You're right; he's overweight as F%&amp;^.
Spursdc::He needs to lose weight, too
VCURAMNATION.::Peyton just signed with the Broncos!!!!! BYE BYE TEBOW

vaplaya0::No lategame rest for the spurs starters...wiz job is complete!!!
FrankPistachio211::I'm at a loss for words... this is truly pitiful.
FrankPistachio211::Pretty much.
ImOldschool1964::Spurs won't do anything in the pst season.  Sad.  ANother year with a good regular season,,only to be smoke and mirrors.
NBA_refs_are_weak::wow Ive never seen the kind of differential in +/- between starters and the bench, especially that much in favor of the bench
GBTsports7::Somebody put a hand in Nick Young's face!!!!! 6/7 from the field with 16 points......Fantasy points for me!!!!!!
Dirtybearcub::lets see javale knock down some 3's
GBTsports7::That would be Comedy Central right there.
