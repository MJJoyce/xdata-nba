cheeez::I was really suprised seing the Blazers having an 8-2 start this season. Hope they are for real this season. Lillard is starting to be the star alongside Lamarcus. But they should utilize their bench more if they want to be successful in the post season.
dan::Now the Lakers will really be in danger of missing the playoff.  Blazers might take the last bus or 7th seed  after Thunder, Rockets, Clippers, Spurs, Warriors, and Grizzlies.
eja::Wow. Jonas in the game in the last 20 seconds. Other than a twisted ankle I'm not exactly sure what that's supposed to accomplish
Amir::Blazers had worst bench last season , now with Mo its solid and playoff is possible.
HughJohnson::don't let up Blazer's,  these guys are all good players, don't under estimate them!!!  Go Blazers!
Josh::Overtime, this is going to be close.
Ronald::Lillard plays like a veteran already. He should be in the All Star game this season.
eja::Casey's non use of Jonas is OT is astounding
eja::No Jonas in OT? Is he hurt?
Mert::Keep it up Nicolas i need more triple !!
