JLinNASA::NBA is rigged.  YouTube actual game footages of fake calls.  It was upsetting and sad.   I predict not one, not two, not three but multiple championships. -David Stern
Mr. Sparks88::Man I HATE the Heat, and love the Celtics, and even I can say I was impressed by the win.  I really thought we had it in the bag.  But that comeback was fierce.  And as far as LBJ goes, I think he is an amazing player.  I respect the hell out of his ball skills, but don't like him because he's not on the Cs.  If the Cs had him, we'd be unstoppable.  I don't get why people hate so hard on the guy.  Good game Miami.  See you next game, and hope it will be another good one.
Joshuabeightol::Well said
Cvega9652::-911, whats your emergency -id like to report a suicide. - a man was running in train tracks, screaming "IM NOT IMPRESSED" - then he got hit by the train
jt8776::Miami is 22-5 against the west....now who do you think will beat the heat 4 out 7 with home court through out?
cpost19::Celtics still could. Unlikely, but possible. It's not like this game was a blowout. Hopefully KG gets healthy for the playoffs and we can make a run.
VanGundyGoneHipster::Miami's streak is now equal to or greater than the win totals of 3 teams in their division, yes division.
Dorosy225::The people that are saying that LeBron is thug because "he looked at him too long", are the same people that were picked last on the play ground. Get a life, terry deserved it anyway.
Jimmy30313::Heat fans get more exited over a dunk than a win
flybye23::equally excited for both !!!!!!!!!!!
Jimmy30313::Such an impressive dunk by Lebron, who's he's next victim? Mugsey Bogues?
jt8776::Hey deandre Jordan dunked on Brandon knight and he's a foot shorter nobody said anything about that.
flybye23::still crying bro ?   don't worry, the bullying in school will stop once you graduate
Jimmy30313::Do people realise that Terry was answering a question from the media?
Jimmy30313::What a tough guy Lebron is, staring down Terry. Dude is half his size
Crown1125::So people complaining about Lebron staring at a guy with height disadvantage but fail to realize that midget got a mouth that makes up for his lack of size. Give me a break. I'm hoping deandre jordan also dunks on terrys sorry $@%
LetsPlayScRyB::he just looked at him. he barely stared but fans get their feelings hurt when that stuff happens
flybye23::poor Jason Terry and Jimmy30313, their feelings are hurt   =(
flybye23::he looked at him for 1.5 seconds.  go cry somewhere else loser !!!  Terry should have kept his mouth shut huh !?!?
flybye23::wow, this win is lingering !!!!  damn it feels good.  one of my favorite all time wins by the Heat !!!! must really suck for Celts fans and players to have gotten soooooo excited after being up by 13 in the 4th quarter only to have all their hopes and dreams squashed by a superior team.  poor Jeff Green !!!  poor cry baby Rivers !!!  poor old man Pierce !!!  and a big thanks to J. Terry for giving me a moment i will NEVER  forget.  You being dunked on like that brings happy tears and has catapulted to the top 3 of my favorite dunks of all time !!!  to Terry and Pierce.....you impressed yet ?  lmao
Cvega9652::i bet u he was impressed when the celtics had a 19 straight in 09, but since its not his team he's not impressed
jt8776::Jimmy you have to give credit where credit is do. It's 23 straight your almost never gonna see that again.
Jimmy30313::Impressed by a 2 point win over an undermanned Celtics?
Drew4925::How is Pierce questionable for the HOF?
flybye23::very impressed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   lmao
flybye23::Jason Terry is a future HOFer ???  wow, you are seriously delusional.   even Pierce is questionable
Jimmy30313::Future HOFers
LetsPlayScRyB::dont matter they are average players
Jimmy30313::Pierce and Terry still arent impressed
LetsPlayScRyB::it could be half a point we still won
RjEddy919::while everybody is busy slurping on lebron the heat, the nuggets are on a 13 game win streak, but nobody is talking about it.
Crown1125::Let the west worry about those nuggets.
LetsPlayScRyB::ESPN does talk about it tho
biggbrian35::ESPN seems to be talking about it ...HATER
fairandbalanced00::Because 23&gt;13.    That's why!!
jt8776::Wow the heat are 22-5 against the west ...now that's impressive!!
fairandbalanced00::And I thought the east was weak.
Daytona_600::Whew, thanks Terry  -Brandon Knight
Cvega9652::hahaha
flybye23::lmao
MiamiViceMiami::Wait a minute, where am I, what year is this?   Jason Terry
mitchelldavis8::Miami is so over rated they have lost at least 4 or 5 of the games in this streak. Im not that impressed honestly
LetsPlayScRyB::Miami is over rated? how so?
Mambaholic 33::Hmmmm - Wins = Losses....No wonder u like soccer!
Mambaholic 33::AMAZING!!!!
FlawlessVictoryKidTheDestroyerOfAllEvil::"AMAZING GAME TODAY. Final score of 1 to 1 after an epic comeback...."
demetrius721::Pat attention people....... What we r seein from bron is something we will neve see again.... Has anyone seen terry? Oh I forgot.... He got ran over by train lastnite
demetrius721::Still tripping off of the lebron dunk...... I mean... Is the bron the best or what?  We r seeing something we will never see again.... Pay attention people
Mambaholic 33::Terry TeaBag Landing Strip!!!!!
The God of Trolls Returns for the 7th Time::What does Reggie Evans and the Celtics have in common? They used the word 'not impressed with the Heat'.  Moral Lesson: Next time opponents are about to face the Heat, NEVER use the 'not impressed' word on them. NEVER
LetsPlayScRyB::im not impressed with pierce missing the last shot lol
Black Joe24::Lebron will block Boston's rings for years to come . As a Boston fan I just don't see how we can compete on a championship level with these pieces. The free agents will cost a fortune in 2014
Vermin_cain::Terry are you OK? Terry are you OK? Are you OK Terry? You've been hit by, you've been dunked on, by a smooth criminal...
Rob_Gronkkkkkkk::Lebron gave him that "Say your going to stop my streak one more time" look.
thebuckeyeryguy::I don't have a problem with LeBron posterizing Jason Terry (especially since some Celtic fans and players seem to have an air of superiority about them), but standing and looking down on Terry like Zeus looking down from Mount Olympus is just a Busch League move... and it was deserving of the technical foul call.  Don't like the call?  Then just turn and walk away.
Cj2214::relax guys his panuche is a lil tight right now...
spruce up::Maybe you don't play sports? Sounds like you don't understand the point, which was well made by LeBron.  Terry is a trash-talker and he deserved it  It was perfect.
Jarhead0881::I have absolutely NO problem with LeBron staring Terry down. All the $@%! Terry talks, he had it coming. There's nothing Busch league about it. Some of the classiest players in NBA history have done it!!
odimina::My man ZO did it all game long!!
NBAFanFirst::I can't believe how soft fans have gotten. Really? Staring at someone is a bush league move? Go watch WNBA.
smokingstogies305::He took the tech. Next time LeBron will stare him down again and take that tech too.
thebuckeyeryguy::If that's what he wants, then that's what he'll get.
SuperDomeElectrician::Which Lebron did.. lol
thebuckeyeryguy::...after giving him the Superman stare.
seanie719::Ahhhhhhh............ :)
Vermin_cain::Hey trolls, even your leader Skip Baseless took the day off from bashing the King and the Heat...Why don't you all do the same?
spruce up::I prefer Skip Clueless
SPORTS-TALK-::Hey bandwagon  The King lol of what? Rings no
Vermin_cain::@Sports-Talk, didn't your leader Skip Baseless tell you to take the day off, boy?
ElMiamiFanatico::The king of the NBA. The MVP, best player int he world and yes he will get ring #2/many this year on top.
pdiddy0622::Boston on suicide watch!
ElMiamiFanatico::LOl jason terry is forever gonna be remembered as one of Lebron's top 20 dunks of all-time. That 1 dunk just erased terry's whole career accomplishments hahahahahhahaha thats what u get when you talk trash like that, BURNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aicyla22 is my wifey.::how good are heat coming back from the dead. sign of worthy champions
TheSixthHeatle::Miami is doing something right, here come the professional haters! Haters marry haters, and have hater kids!
SPORTS-TALK-::Bandwagon
Martell Faye::Go Heatz
TheSixthHeatle::*Heat, no plural for Heat
TheSixthHeatle::Excuses are like Bostonians, they stink.
digimon.emperor::whats up
TexasHoldsItsOwn::Heat will win the rest of their regular season games and lose 4 straight in the playoffs
mhan1850::seems like a good analysis
Skynet33::and then you woke up.
Yankeesforthewin11::Lebronsa = hypesa
SuperDomeElectrician::Where's the justice? Lebron needs to be charged for murder of Jason Terry! lol
biggbrian35::Orat least some form of sexual assault for so much nuts in the face
SuperDomeElectrician::In the court of public opinion, the playoffs start now for the Heat.
thereyago111::good streak goin heat, great win against the celts. heat should have lost. then again theres alot of things that should have happened 1 way, and happened another. although if i went to vegas w/ a poketfull of aces, i probably would win most card games. or get kicked out of the casino. point is; streak, no streak, fun to watch. cheers to the heat, and their stacked deck, riley is a big player in the nba casino.

SandyBeachesinla::Let me start by saying I hate the Celtics, After watching 10 minutes of the Celtics/Heat game,, I am at lost for NBA and its officiating,,, these guys went way out of their way to make sure Heat win that game..
ryyyang::Are you for reals?  Jeff Green got all the calls.  Dude had an unbelievable night.
TheSixthHeatle::Green got calls because he was aggressive and that is why Miami got and gets call, 50 points in the paint!!  You idiots can't dribble spit much less know anything about basketball, all I hear are excuses and they stink like old people poop.
ryyyang::the next excuse to come out of the Celtics fans mouth is, "We didn't have KG and Rondo".  LOL.
ryyyang::I was wrong.  The next excuse ^^^^ was, "Let me start by saying I hate the Celtics, After watching 10 minutes of the Celtics/Heat game,, I am at lost for NBA and its officiating,,, these guys went way out of their way to make sure Heat win that game.."
friendly_neighborhood _scrawler::LEBRON JUST BECAME....The Most Interesting Man in the World  - NO Dos Equis for YOU....<span style="text-decoration: blink;">stay thirsty haters</span>
BigHarryRox::Blow me cHeat !!! You guys will never live down the fact that Dirk wiped the court with your sorry Arsses in 2011 Finals, all the while  Queen James and  "What's Happening Duane? " Wade are showing their lack of class and humility while mocking Dirk... And He Did it with the Flu bug... Those two are Losers forever in my book!!!
TheSixthHeatle::1-1 in finals = nothing, where is Dallas. Classy organizations start at the top and end with fans, Dallas has no class on either end. The most racist fan base by far and the tackiest. Go start an investigation on how Wade used every guard and forward on the 06' team!
cjs3377::Dude your owner is the biggest jacas* moron around and you talk about class he has none.
miami_heat_2012_champs::good point!!!
BigHarryRox::Wow, great comeback pal, Is that all you got?? Face it, they are are no class ego maniacs, and nothing will change it . I will take my Dirk lead one Championship over anything. Class all the way, and did I already say he did it with the flu?? And BTW, don't u know LOL is for girls??
ryyyang::of course.  there are always haters.  LOL.  don't forget Dirk and the mavs lost to an 8th seed.  hahahahaha.
friendly_neighborhood _scrawler::Who this time next year will be riding Durant Jock for the Mvp. Reminder Lebron will be the same player next year.
ryyyang::that's what they've been saying for the last 5 years.
friendly_neighborhood _scrawler::What can i say....They must love how Durant's A33 Taste....
Rob_Gronkkkkkkk::Evening Ladies
81becca90210::The HEAT won't beat the streak
pdiddy0622::Road dog U feminine as isht meng
JO3611::LOL https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=sz0kFUnNtIo   YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS
LeBron James MVPX4::as God as my witness he is broken in half Classic
mugglyandhazel::THE DUNK ON JT WAS A ORGANIZED CRIME BY THE HEATS..... JT GOT ROBBED BY WADE, PUNKED BY MARIO, FOOLED BY COLE AND MURDERED BY THE KING...... LOL IS LIKE THEY ARE PLAYING MONKEY IN THE MIDDLE. JHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAH
