johnnychimpoo::Paul Allen please actually invest more in the Blazers or just sell the $@%!$@% team, your a !$@%!$@ waste and making this team a mockery of the NBA. We can beat Miami, Spurs, Knicks but then have also lost to Cleavland, Washington, and Orlando. Two of those teams being on 12 game losing streaks. Also we don't have the nba record for most 3 pointers taken with out making one (witch we broke this year 0 for 21) thanks to the Nuggets i think.
Navy Squid45::No way the magic won a game!!! It's a miracle!! Go Magic!!
Ivanov21::Vucevic &gt; Howard
sk0dawgs::welp.... fellow blazer fans. i've lost faith in this season. i think i will have to put my passion towards something else for the rest of the year in order to stay sane.
ThinYellowLine::Lillard and the dreaded "rookie wall?"  "Tis a long season indeed.
jfoote1212::might have got  a gem in vucevic.   cringed when i saw jemeer's shooting  puked when i saw lillard's.
TampaBayVol::One day they're going to call the trade "the Vucevic trade" not "the Howard trade"
TampaBayVol::Was disappointed at first.  Saw loads of comments from Sixers fans saying that we were going to love him.  Boy, do we.
johnnywalnuts87::yup. pisses me off as a sixer fan
johnnywalnuts87::as a sixer fan im happy to see nicky doing good. i was dissapointed when they traded him. my girlfriend was even more pissed. what a wasted  trade. it gets worst more along the season we go. bynum will never play. and richardson was always  hurt and now is hurt for the year.
Frank9672::Well that's pretty lopsided: Lillard 1-16 shooting 12 assists...
asdbluecfl::Jameer's been stepping up his play lately, 15 assists tonight. Need to see more of that out of him.
Elton7323::4-18 he should stop shooting and pass more.
ssj2gokuvsgallade::Holy crap...Did we actually win a game?
HelmuthJJ::magic finally won a game...vs a good team to boot!
asdbluecfl::Good win Magic. Vuc is going to be a baller next season.
fosterwhitlock::please trade redick to the pacers
sworthin117::or to the Blazers...
Kobelies247::Isnt it funny how all the teams who are on long losing streaks somehow beat Portland?  Everytime.....
sk0dawgs::hilarrrrious
A Cane Thang::Has Kyle O'Quinn been playing a lot more lately?
Rollintide08::JJ Redick!! JJ Redick!!
FatCat_00::1-16 ???  thats gotta be the worst prcentage of anybody taking at least 10 shots
rumelpob::In history?  No.  Tim Hardaway had a 0-17 game.
A Cane Thang::He had 13 assists in that game, and the Warriors actually won.
GreenGux::took 2 ot's to hit the over
GreenGux::Overs should hit now...
RoidRage888::$@%!$ hole
PsychicChangeWeil::Terrible job by Coach Vaughn. When Ayon gets hot, you have to pull him and put O'Quinn back in. The 12 in a row had me thinking he knew what he was doing, but this was a loseable game that he just gave away. Not the way to get Shabazz Muhammad. If you're serious about losing, you need to go out every game knowing what your job is. Eyes on the prize, boys.
Ill-Blaze::isn't shabazz draft value dropping? honestly I think he's not gonnna be as great as he's expected to be and this draft class is pretty weak
Go_Sounders::Wanna hear a joke?  PORTLAND..... LMFAO ROFL
Sammy_GD::I like turtles
RoidRage888::The apple cup is between Washington and Washington state
rumelpob::I'm aware.  Look at his teams, he is a fan of the University of Washington Huskies football team, and the Washington State Cougars football team...
RoidRage888::I like the apple cup
RoidRage888::Want to hear a joke go saunders
rumelpob::Or another one.  A Huskies and Cougars fan.  I guess you never have to worry about losing the apple cup.
Brianhau529::Wanna hear a joke.  Supersonics
Brianhau529::LeBron is having the best stretch of his life right now, and we play him in 2 days. $@%!
johnnywalnuts87::writers dont get bored. look at manning and all his mvps. he still got votes this year when AP shoulda got every single vote
rumelpob::LeBron is having one of the great stretches in NBA history.  It is scary the level he is playing at, but the only reason he may not win the MVP this year is that the voters might be getting bored handing it to him.
Brianhau529::He may be the best player ever. Needs some more rings but dam he is just playing perfect right now
cflip37::Kyle, Nicholson,Vuc, Harkless(once he develops offense) = good future
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::Oops, think i was sleeping
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::Don't forget O'Quinn .... could be a sleeper!
OPENLYUGLY::"Kyle"
OPENLYUGLY::Got to get them a young PG to run their show.
OPENLYUGLY::I don't think so, but they should at least find some minutes for him to see what he has. Hate to lose another Clark because the coach to too stubborn to pull out a vet.
magicnbucs::Agreed. I don't think Ish will be the one.
EnricoMeli::LMA is a good player, but an awful rebounder. Simply aweful. We get killed on the boards every game. LMA has like 6 boards when the opposing big man has like 20?
trizzo23::and andrew is a rookie..only 14th start
trizzo23::ayon played more at pf...he had 12
rumelpob::LMA is not a center.  He plays the PF position.  The opposing PF only had 5 rebounds which is actually less than LMA.  The Blazers need Myers Leonard to develop.  Hixon is simply too short.  At this point the Blazers are out of the playoffs.  I would start Leonard the rest of the way and see if he can develop.
BaySports 1.1::He is a PF averaging 9+.  Not bad.  Problem is we have no center.  Although Hickson has performed admirably..
rumelpob::Yes it is, which gets back to my point of finding a legit cheap C.  They don't exist.  Legit centers exist, and cheap centers exist.  No center that is legit though is cheap.
Ill-Blaze::i'd say go after mozgof this off season
Ill-Blaze::rumelpob - There is no such thing as a legit cheap C.  A C worth a damn is 6 mill+  6 mill is farley cheap for a c
rumelpob::There is no such thing as a legit cheap C.  A C worth a damn is 6 mill+
Ill-Blaze::yea we deff need to get a legit cheap c to develop leonard behind
Ill-Blaze::idk he has had double doubles in all our road games this outing except this one
OPENLYUGLY::He played against a true Center.
magicnbucs::I'm glad the Magic won, but let's not forget where this team really is. This is a season long training camp designed to do just well enough to keep some loyal fans in the seats while young players get some valuable experience. Any wins we get along the way to our lottery pick are icing on the cake.  That said...I'm really starting to love watching Vucevic play!
Ill-Blaze::yea congrats you guys earned it tonight we just couldn't keep you guys off the boards really showed us our glaring weakness @ the center position
OPENLYUGLY::Did the Blazers play last night and they were on a 2B2B?
Ill-Blaze::yea all our starters are playing 30+ minutes
BaySports 1.1::The starters have to play hella minutes every night because our bench is awful.  They tend to look tired at one point or another, every game.
tunguyent2::how the $@%!$? can't you let the magic score 110, they sucks di8ck
EnricoMeli::Blazers have lost to the Magic, the Cavs, the Wizards twice ... and they have beaten the Heat, the Spurs, the Knicks, the Nuggets ... etc ...
Kobelies247::yAWN
rumelpob::What I don't understand is why the blazers have so many haters.  I'm a lifelong Blazers fan, born and raised in Portland.  I lived there for 25 years.  Like a true fan I have stuck it out through disappointing year after disappointing year.  I just don't understand though why people need to hate on the Blazers.  What is the point in being insecure about a team that hasn't won since the 70s?  We aren't a threat to you guys yet at least.
EnricoMeli::Very high expectations ... the most unlucky team in the NBA. Passed on MJ, selected Greg Oden and lost Roy to Injury and employed Nate McMillan for way too long.
johnnychimpoo::We have had player injuries but clearly the problem is our front office. They are practically 5th graders. Also our billionaire owner is putting in 53 million this year, while the lakers (granted they are the lakers..) have throw down 100million (maimi=83million, Knicks=80million). If we spent around 70-75million we could easily have a bench........that has useful people on it.
Ill-Blaze::yea but we wouldn't have took mj that year anywayz our second option was barkley
rumelpob::I'm aware of their history.  They were actually one of two teams to pass on MJ, the rockets just actually got something out of it.  None of that history though should mean that the Blazers should end up with a disproportionate amount of haters.
OPENLYUGLY::Seems like it's their own fans doing the hating.
Ill-Blaze::OPENLYUGLY - Not sure they do.  they do lol we get minny trolls and laker trolls and kobielies is a clippers bandwagon troll
OPENLYUGLY::Not sure they do.
rumelpob::Yes, but as a fan of the Blazers, it makes sense that I would care about what they have and have not done.  Why do other fans care?
OPENLYUGLY::Keep playing these young guys more. Let them keep working together. When Turkoglu comes back, keep him on the bench.
Fraka9::in 3 games vuc is going to lead the nba in boards. howard has 11.8, vuc 11.6 after this one...
DrHuggybear::YES!!!!
2846mike::Starsky and Hutch. Nice.
TheCronoMasterMind::Losing streak is finally over woo! Good job on the win Magic! :)
ClydeTheGlide_22::Didn't we lose to the wizards when they lost like their first 12 games or something? this is just the same thing happening over again
Ill-Blaze::yea $@%!$@ huh? lol hopefully well fix out bench problem before the trade deadline and maybe pick up an adequate starting c in the offseason
BaySports 1.1::Yes.
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::If only the Magic could play Lakers, Clippers and Blazers more often!
Ill-Blaze::wow split the season series against us now you think you can beat us everytime lol...... talk about getting gassed up lol
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::Buzz Killa!
Abraham_Drinkin::no, you wouldn't, Golden State would beat you 9 times out of 10.
steelcurtain386::except that time the magic swept them. I wonder when that was
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::heck, we'd be .500
jssed2010::Your name is amazing
OPENLYUGLY::Warriors too.
Abraham_Drinkin::i think i just might shoot myself in the head this evening
Nowitzki.::If u expected the Blazers to be in the playoffs this season you should have shot yourself in the head in the beginning of the season
Abraham_Drinkin::25-26, losing to Orlando (amongst others)...we're not alright at all.
BaySports 1.1::Haha, we will be alright man.  Check our results this season, lots of losing streaks, lots of winning streaks.
bjohns55::should redick be traded or should orlando resign him as one of the rebuilding pieces of the franchise? i think he would be a great fit to the pacers or spurs!!!
bjohns55::there is a lot of things to like about redick. one, he is still a relatively young player, two his work ethic, three his ever developing game, and four he is willing to help the franchise rebuild and not bail or give up during hard times. pretty impressive!
erf420::bring jj to detroit for stuckey
TheCronoMasterMind::The entire offense runs through him, and he's still skilled, I say keep him and build with him. He's already said he loves Orlando.
OPENLYUGLY::ANTE UP!
Jose Juan Barea::And Orlando fans, don't talk sh!t... 1 win in 13 games is not something to be proud of.  It's like being the smartest in a special needs class.
Ill-Blaze::hasn't the wolves only won 1 game against us in the last 15 or so meetings? rofl thats horrible
ClydeTheGlide_22::lolwolves
Ill-Blaze::lol minnesota already lost the season series against us one more game and we can sweep your team
bronbronsdad::says the PR midget
TheCronoMasterMind::That joke is so original and funny. You should totally do stand-up. You obviously bring your A-game to trolling.
chris johnson 558::coming from a wolves fan lol
BaySports 1.1::Wait wait, a Minnesota fan.  LOL
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Wow I thought I bashed my team.  You Portland fans are rude.   Respect.
Brianhau529::have fun being 15-36
Abraham_Drinkin::rude? i'm sorry, but i tell it how i see it.
sdfasdfasdfsdfsdf::Fu ck off!!!  By the way, not a fan of these fu cking lame teams.
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::Any given night .......................... FINALLY!!!!!!!
Nowitzki.::Lillard takes a lot of stupid shots.Its not a coincidence that he shoots 42% overall and was 1-16 today
pussyscientist::what a frickin idiot
Nowitzki.::truth makes u mad?
rumelpob::The guy is a rookie.  He is learning.  He had been doing better as of late.  Have patience.
Nowitzki.::he's a great talent but needs to improve his decision making.Those wild long 3 pointers are ugly
Jose Juan Barea::You guys are wasting the prime of LMA... Get him an adequate bench.
Ill-Blaze::yea our bench is rediculous but then again this wasn't supposed to be a year where we was even contending for a playoff spot we were supposed to be a basement team
2846mike::spoken like a Cavs or Raptor fan. Congrats if Portland has sunk that low.
Abraham_Drinkin::......or get an adequate bench. if you had a clue, you'd know that's where we lose games.
2846mike::Yeah..thats what it is because Portland has been to the Finals in how long?
2846mike::Trade him to a good team.
phunky58::booom the magic win,  goood game drew outplayed mr lillard
sdfasdfasdfsdfsdf::Portland isn't relevant.
rumelpob::Neither are people that create random names today so that they can come and tell portland fans how irrelevant they are.
kevkev3426::Get to say two words that I haven't said in a while: Magic Won!
HunterF4444::Lillard is a huge joke
ClydeTheGlide_22::Because he had an off shooting night makes him "a huge joke." I guess the 12 assists is some hilarious joke as well.
phunky58::i dont care wat lillard did this game, he is the real deal.  anyone who says he is a joke needs to get their head checked
Ill-Blaze::lol every player has an off game look at his assist numbers though
Brianhau529::you're dumb as $@%!. Obviously know nothing about basketball
Abraham_Drinkin::yes, one game makes a player a "huge joke". congratulations.
Jose Juan Barea::If you guys somehow beat Miami, then there's something seriously wrong...
BaySports 1.1::We beat them already, clown.
Ill-Blaze::we've already beat them this year
