CavsPatsBucks22::the cometh of redlobster57 has come
Apakalypse085::What do u think the Heat trolls are up to? Fap.ping to their Lebron Fathead in their Lebron jersey crying or......nope, that's exactly what they're doing.
53Kevin::I like that Apakalypse085,lol ,but please don't contaminate our board by  bringing up those troll nobodys!
IlliniDave68::Here's my latest -  http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/3/3/b7b93221-226d-4472-a966-d0fcc18f72cf.jpg
IlliniDave68::LOL! TY, sir! Took me FOREVER to find a blank one to work with. Here's the link to it, for any who are interested -  http://s3-ak.buzzfed.com/static/imagebuzz/web04/2011/6/13/13/heres-a-blank-template-feel-free-to-do-your-22547-1307985729-291.jpg
ttecza::LMAO! Hit the nail on the head with that one.
IlliniDave68::Here's one I generated -  http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/14971313.jpg
Robert24907::Honestly im a Bulls fan, i DO NOT waste my time writing things about Lebron trying to make him look bad or make him look like he is a dumb $@%. He makes 100 million a year with endorsement a year more than me or you.Lol.. Im worried about stopping him against my Bulls.
Apakalypse085::Rose makes more lolololololololol
IlliniDave68::Thing is, Robert, the guy has made himself a target.  Just the way it is.  Do I hate him? No.  That's because I don't fear him.
ttecza::He is the best player out there right now. No question about it. Its the other things that make you go, hmmmmmm.
IlliniDave68::http://www.asternwarning.com/images/stories/18_318120540.jpg
ttecza::That's some funny stuff you got there, Dave. LOL!
IlliniDave68::Yeah, T, that is one of my favorites!
superman253540::Lebron James to miss the next 5 games with a hairball
Robert24907::Dude let it go hating on Leron makes you look stupid now.....
superman253540::Derrick Rose is Batman!
DallasDallasNum1::In the past two years in the last 24 seconds of games, with the score tied or close, Lebron has ONLY taken 9 shots. He has only made one of them.  thoughts???
Party at Sanduskys or Bernies which is more fun::its all irrelevant.  When the HEAT destroy the BULLS over the next few meetings it will shut up the Bulls fans for good.
IlliniDave68::I don't expect that to happen.   If it happens, it happens.  Until then, how about helping yourself to a nice, steaming cup of STFU.  :)
mhardie6::Lebron james 16 4th quarter points last night
ttecza::And one crazy ass pass!
IlliniDave68::Speaking of -  http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/15551694.jpg  Yeah. There's a meme for that.
buller23::ur stupid
Epicki::Lebron James passed the ball to Haslem with a few seconds left. *Miss*
chibearsmonsofmidway::In your dreams! Plus, DRose has scored 17 points in the fourth quarter this year
rynodesign::But what was the outcome? Win or Lose?
rynodesign::Next two games our huge. Lets go get em. Fridell said that the bulls lose 2 of 3. He doesn't think the Bulls can beat the pacers or sixers. WTF.
ttecza::Friedell trying to out think himself. smh.
rynodesign::Our beat writer is a hater. I don't listen to him. Just thought it was interesting that he doesn't feel the Bulls can win those games.
IlliniDave68::Yeah. Friedell is a tool.
chibearsmonsofmidway::Don't listen to Friedell
CyBuck1::I guess the Heat trolls are sleeping in late today.  Can't wait to see them dance around yesterday's loss.
53Kevin::lol
chibearsmonsofmidway::Heatster probably spent all night long crying in his LeBron jersey
53Kevin::lol
RyanCarranza::Very happy with this outcome and very impressed with Deng feeling it!!!  Derrick was Derrick and this was a nice easy game for him.  Brewer played great and Boozer got the boards last night.  112 pts is a nice thing to see from our Bulls too.
ttecza::Luol is adjusting his shot with the bad left wrist. He is improving since the injury. A good sign.
chibearsmonsofmidway::Yeah I'm really impressed with the way Deng has played. The last few games before this he has a few airballs
oa92000::Knicks trash before Lin: 8-15; Knicks trash with Lin : 10-3 LIn can do the same thing for Cleveland..  Go Cleveland!
chibearsmonsofmidway::I'm not so sure about that
yardog59::Has anyone seen HEATSTER?? I haven't seen him here and I'm getting kinda worried!
chibearsmonsofmidway::I could see him right now crying
RyanCarranza::He is crying into his Lebron jersey
venator360::Heatster may be on suicide watch.
DaRealDaBuu::Derrick isnt afraid of failing, thats why he always succeeds. LeChoke on the other hand is a scared little ***** that needs to go buy himself a dog.
Jaguarcrazyboy::True.. Kobe and Derrick mean so much to their teams because they know they can handle the ups and downs. Rose could go ice cold but still take that shot for the win. That is what makes a player great.
cellus24::After watching the heat lose last night D Rose is right about the bulls  beingin the best team in the east maybe the whole NBA http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZLsl4j6ZSk&amp;feature=channel
AdamSaidThis::spam.
sjr1893::Brewer played a great game, Booz called him an "octopus," which was spot on   30 WINS!
Jaguarcrazyboy::Yep, Ronnie Brewer is doing better because he is back to what he is suppose to do. BENCH MOB!
CyBuck1::Last night showed what TRUE fans are.  Bulls fans face the music, win or lose.  Heat TROLLS (fans?) were exposed for the immature, gutless, worthless excuse for human beings that they are.  We all know they'll be back to spew their hate, but I for one will be laughing every time I see one of them post.  The Jazz cut off their balls last night, congrats to the Jazz for silencing them.
Rossi46Doctor::Awesome
chadhenne07::AMEN!!!
alud21::Much different next two games for the bulls, one team is a pretender: 76ers One team is a contender: Pacers
ttecza::Time to TCOB!
Jaguarcrazyboy::Gotta go get the job done.
blh7068::Yep- play who you play beat who you beat. Doesnt matter the record of the opponent. That is Thibs way.
harvardandchicagobulls::I dont care what flamer "fans" say. A loss is a loss(heat) and a killing is a killing (bulls).
jimbabbitt::You know what was great about last night?  With the Bulls' win and the Heat loss, Gogoberry and Heatster were missing in action (at least from what I could see).  That alone increased the IQ level of the people in this conversation string!
IlliniDave68::Gogo made a half-hearted attempt at trolling but you could tell he just wasn't into it.
harvardandchicagobulls::Blackhawks win Too!
Jaguarcrazyboy::GO BULLS. What a team we got. I could see us trading Krover or something but we're good enough now to make it if everyone plays their part. The masked man is back and ready to play some ball!  I think we should pick up Remon Sessions if so though.
blh7068::Why Sessions??? After giving up someone thats certainly helped get the bulls where theyre at...I cant see the team being better with him.
heat r da best everr::Norm Van Lier was one of the winners in all of sports, especially in chicago community's, Ignore my troll name. Real bulls fans knows what he means to us
DCOVEY8434::Hollinger needs to write another article about how Lebron might be having the best season ever.....He passed up a 20 footer for the win, so another guy could brick an 18 footer. Another clutch finish from the guy having the best season of all time....cough cough
Miami_Heat_Greatest_Team_Ever::Real reason why Lebron left Cleveland for Miami. http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;v=AN0WqSeCKW8
Miami_Heat_Greatest_Team_Ever::Guess what people outside of Cleveland think about you city, Cleveland fans?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;v=AN0WqSeCKW8
Maurice8852::For the record. I love the team we have, and wouldnt change anything. Reminds me of a saying, if it aint broke dont try n fix it.
IlliniDave68::^THIS.
blh7068::Agreed. If the Bulls trade for someone thats perceived to be an improvement, certainly they will have to give up someone that helped get this team where they are at NOW. That can be risky. Id sure hate to see them take a step back in an area that could negate overall team improvement.
LosBulls15::missed this game was there anything impressive??
LosBulls15::nice, how did rip look?
BoobieSqueeze::That's not bad. I've been disappointed with Rip so far but 10 pts in 20 min is solid.
IlliniDave68::Not bad - 10 points in 20 minutes on 5/8 shooting.
IlliniDave68::Deng 4/4 from 3, 24 points.
Maurice8852::Rose should take some time this weekend and work on his 3's. he's always had problems from beyond the arch. maybe korver and deng should have a training session with Rose, to improve his game.
LosBulls15::yeah i dont like him shooting threes that much if hes open shoot it but dont force it
IlliniDave68::I wish he'd just leave the 3's to Deng and Korver and do what he does best - slash and drive!
FranklinStrut::Also, Drose has been cold from 3. If he would get hot from 3, look out.
nodonovan1377::We should have Brian "White Mamba" Scalabrine meet Lebron's mom right before the ECF's.  ECF's would be wrapped up before game one's tip-off!!!
nodonovan1377::Boozer and Noah don't have good chemistry together.  Should Boozer just come off the bench for us and should we start the game w/Taj and Noah?  (we already end games w/Taj and Noah as it is)
IlliniDave68::At this point in his career, Boozer might actually be a better bench player. Sadly, his high contract virtually guarantees he'll keep starting. I've never understood the whole "we're paying him starter money so we HAVE to start him" thing.
FranklinStrut::He just is not that old. It is hard to understand. As far as I understand, his injuries have not been the type that should negatively affect his play.
nodonovan1377::I actually think it would be better if Rip came off the bench until the last 10 games of the reg. season or so.  Don't want to see him getting injured anymore.  Brewer is much younger and can log heavier minutes for the next 20 games or so.
nodonovan1377::Wes Welker's hands &gt; Lebron in the 4th quarter
IlliniDave68::I've got a word document that I'm keeping all these meme links recorded in, for easy reference.  ;)
FranklinStrut::Gotta start that. Too many fools to beat down.
nodonovan1377::Basketball Gods,  Please have Bosh and D. Wade go down w/injuries for the playoffs so that coward Lebron James actually has to grow a pair come playoff time!  It's pathetic that the most physically gifted player in the game today is reduced to a statue come clutch time in the 4th quarter and that he ran away from his hometown to play in somebody else's shadow.  ~A NBA FAN
Maurice8852::looks like rape! lebron should press charges. lol
IlliniDave68::Speaking of LeBron playing in someone else's shadow -  http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzz7shZzVv1rpznnqo1_500.png
nodonovan1377::That picture looks more like "who's your daddy Lebron, who's your daddy?  And who's house is this?  who's house?"
nodonovan1377::lmao
IlliniDave68::A few more before I head out -  http://www.terezowens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lebron-ring.jpg  https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/417441_375782532450277_367810133247517_1363415_1082277468_n.jpg  http://thebestdamnsportssiteever.com/captioned_pics/tumblr_ll0o74AbTI1qg2yc0o1_500_1305177398_1308526728.jpg   Have a good one, guys!
IlliniDave68::Sorry, that 2nd link SHOULD have been this one -  http://thebestdamnsportssiteever.com/captioned_pics/lebron-james-016048627_1309284963_1309721746.jpg
Isai5536::lmao
Isai5536::lmao rose on the grid iron https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/404235_371626872865843_367810133247517_1350721_1020373287_n.jpg
BoobieSqueeze::haha should have put him in when Forte was injured
Maurice8852::epic! lol
JoeC231::Once again the Bulls show when they are healthy, they are dangerous. D Rose facilitates and if Lu finds his shot the Bulls are one of the (if not the hardest) teams to beat in the NBA.
Isai5536::Do all my fellow bulls fans feel the same way??? lol this describes me perfectly lmao https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/431535_375554502473080_367810133247517_1362946_1923558803_n.jpg
IlliniDave68::Yep. Same here.
Isai5536::and then thibs call a time out and i start yelling out plays lol
nodonovan1377::Only when the game is on I am the coach in my living room!  "Where's the foul?!!!!!!! This is $@%!$@%!!"
Isai5536::the "what i think i do" fits me lol
Isai5536::lmao lebron knows when the 4th is coming  https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/417441_375782532450277_367810133247517_1363415_1082277468_n.jpg
IlliniDave68::BOOM!!!  Roasted.
nodonovan1377::The asking price for Michael Beasley is just a 1st round pick (all they asked for from the Lakers).  I know he is a headcase but dang thats a low asking price for a 15 ppg career guy.
AdamSaidThis::Beasley? Puh-leeze. His defense is WORSE than Boozer's...and he can't play any position. Too small for pf...too slow for sf.
Maurice8852::WOW! why dont we just trade the entire team for miami? you guys have no faith in a team that number 1? really?! boozer does what he does, and thats getting paid something you haters dont.
Isai5536::i would like him too. to have the #1 and #2 pick of the same draft?? crazy!
nodonovan1377::Yeah I was hoping we coulda got david lee.  Boozer seemed like we were settling after Amare went to N.Y.
Isai5536::i would have like david lee alot more
nodonovan1377::I wish the Bulls would amnesty Boozer and sign Beasley.  Taj could come in and start at the 4.  Beasley would be cheaper and he's younger.  Plus he's 6'10 so he could back up the 4 for Taj as well.    Bulls don't have the balls to do it though.  They also don't wanna pay Boozer all that money for 1 1/2 yrs of service on a 5 yr contract.
Isai5536::Even Gogogoberry gots a ring lmao https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=376342249060972&amp;set=a.367811313247399.97794.367810133247517&amp;type=1&amp;theater
nodonovan1377::Word is Brandon Roy is not really retired and that he just didn't want to be amnestied and then get picked up by the T-Wolves.  B. Roy future Chicago Bull anyone???
Isai5536::could be a spark of the bench
IlliniDave68::Then there's this one -  http://thebestdamnsportssiteever.com/posters/110616.07_1308313141_1308313186.jpg
nodonovan1377::How big of a dumba$$ is D12 for not wanting to come to Chicago???
IlliniDave68::Pretty dumb. Still, while the Bulls could use him, Orlando's asking price would be too high.
IlliniDave68::Yeah, I miss Andres too.  Saw a game down here in Atlanta where the Bulls blew the Hawks out by 40! Nocioni was all over the place in that one!   Not bad for the first NBA game I'd ever seen in person.  :)
nodonovan1377::I love Noah's heart but too many nights I see him w/4-8 points and think man if only he'd score more!  Dwight is such an upgrade.  I know it's kinda got me feeling like a sellout but D12 is hands down the #1 center in the leauge.  If he was interested I don't think we could pass on him.    I was also very upset when we let go of Nocioni.  That dude was ALL heart.  The freakin Rudy of our team.
IlliniDave68::Not to sanguine on the idea of giving up Noah, either, but I hear where you're coming from.
nodonovan1377::If we could get him for just Noah and Taj along w/bench players and the Bobcat draft pick it would be worth it.  But they would want Deng too and we don't have a good back-up 3 to defend LBJ so NO!
IlliniDave68::This one made me chuckle, too -  http://thebestdamnsportssiteever.com/captioned_pics/315122040_1307330325_1308527846.jpg
nodonovan1377::Nicki Minaj made fun of C. Bosh for cryin in a rap song, lol.
Isai5536::yes she did lol
Isai5536::lmao
nodonovan1377::Whats ur favorite pair of Air Jordan?  Mine is the Concords (black and white w/the leather shoe when he came back in 95)
nodonovan1377::Yeah I just looked them up they were nice.  I like the black and more white just cause they look like a dress shoe.  I thought they were fresh when they first came out.  Still luv em!
Isai5536::i was going to get the Nike Sb Space jams when they came out but was too late :( http://images.freshnessmag.com/wp-content/uploads//2011/04/nike-sb-dunk-low-space-jam-new-images-1.jpg
Isai5536::tho i have never owned a pair of jordans(only like NIKE SB, Vans, Chucks.) the best i have seen are the Space Jams
Isai5536::basically the concords but switch the colors lol
Isai5536::i want this so bad. $70 god damn just for a crew neck -.- http://culturekings.com.au/shoppingcart/product_images/x/422/IMG_8452__63480_zoom.jpg
nodonovan1377::Ya'll know Jordan was born in Brooklyn right?
