FreakinObnoxiousGentile::Jeff Green sucks & Avery Bradley needs to learn to share the rock!
Guest::FOR THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED- I WON'T COME BACK TO READ HATE REPLIES NOR COMMENTS POSTED ABOUT ME SO ENJOY WASTING TIME REPLYING TO YOURSELVES & ENJOY YOUR STUPIDITY LOL  Spurs give up 100+ points a game, lack defense, lack 7 footers, lack rebounders, & rely on 3 pointers. Where were the Spurs fans when they CHOKED in the Finals?  I watched NBA for 27 years & I never seen a team so pathetic & choke like the Spurs. Double digit lead in the 4th, up by 5 with 28 seconds left, Leonard missed 1 freethrow to close out the Finals & Pop took out his rebounders & starters at the end like an idiot! They CHOKED as USUAL LOL. THIS IS THE 5TH SEASON I WILL SAY IT, SPURS WON'T WIN THE TITLE!
WAMBO::#$%$, Manu might not be on this game against the Mavs, his Ham might have gotten hurt, hopefully some stretching, heat and ice will fix it but I am sure Pop will bench him.  GO SPURS GO!
Mr::Since tomorrow is a back to back and is nationally televised, I expect the Big 3 to have a rest.
fed up::thru three quarters tonight---8 free throws. way to drive again tonight Mav's
Prentis P::Dam why did we do our lil brothers like that dammm man...
John::Hey Dallas, if you haven't figured it out, you're done- love it !!!
Anton::No Marion no hustle.
Kenny Powers::Dallas was just flat tonight. It happens...
louie molina::GO SPURS GO!!! GO FOR THE WIN!!!
