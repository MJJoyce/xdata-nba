Ngoo Nam::The Raptors may take the Atlantic division title.
Aktion Pak::carlisle keeps making plays for old dirk when it's very clear monta is the new sheriff in dallas; no wonder no big name bother to come to dallas because mavs organization always want dirk to remain as face of franchise too selfish unlike miami heat lebron has taken over as being franchise and d-wade being former franchise player is more than ok with it
whoaaa::Brandon Wright can play.  Blair should get getting 20 minutes a game, Wright 30.
Teams stink::Dallass, you are SUCH an up and down team.  You LOST AT HOME to the craptors????!!!!!  You suck, blow, are pathetic, smell, are garbage, etc, etc....
venecuba::Calderon is a talented PG
clint::Calderon continues to be efficient. maybe the efficient at his position?
poyman::Another late game loss... I think that makes about 3 or 4 that we have lost in the last quarter or OT... The Mavs bodies can't keep this up all season, they're just getting a little old.  Our bigs have to be able to hit high pressure foul shots going down the wire... Wright's 2 free throws that he clanked at the end of OT cost us this game.
Shane F::why wright is not starting is mind boggling
Anton::Raptors are going to make the playoffs lol
No nickname::Keeping working hard #50. Even if they don't play you maybe something else will work out on down the line. We all think the world of you back here in Southeast Missouri!
