Cyril::Detroit fans are seeing what Bucks fans already knew: Brandon Jennings is not a smart or reliable point guard. Sure, he has games where he hits a ton of shots, and games where he gets a lot of assists, but he does it all his own way and can't orchestrate a team.
Hugh VanNoordwyk::The Pistons are pretty awful. For a while I thought they were an average team on the way to getting better. Boy, was I deceived! I wonder what their record would be in the Western Conference! Probably worse than Utah!!
Omar::Piston need practice, specially in shooting...
Judd Kast::Pistons' are playing schizo like the LIONs did - they need to play every night - not every other night -   LET's not make the same mistake as the Lions and disenchastize their good talent with lackluster play. In pro sports you got to bring it every night or you should ride the pine.
J::How many threes will Josh Smith miss TONIGHT? 5?
Matthew::Jennings -- PASS IT ... STOP SHOOTING @**HOLE!
asnigro::Jennings middle name is Brick.  Brandon Brick Jennings... has a nice ring to it.
Bobbyk::When Milwaukee doesnt sign a guy Detroit should think about it.BTW Why isnt Charlie V starting?
KEITH::Villanueva, Gordon, Smith ,Jennings. What a waste of money over the years.
Tony Anthony::This is awesome! I've never seen this Wizards team play so well on both sides of the ball! Hope they don't lose this lead.
