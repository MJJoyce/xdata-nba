John::Atlanta is without question the #3 team in the East. They probably are a lottery team in the West.
Jakerson::3 ball at the buzzer for the win.  Just another day at the office.
Gopher Fan::Wow! What a comeback win - Dubs are rolling!
bgood2life::Golden State, played like they were the home team,instead of being the visitors.
David::Congratulations on the great comeback Warriors. You guys look much more like a TEAM at the end of the 4th.
dster20::Called the winning shot (lucky guess) but very happily surprised the Warriors would dig down deep for this win. Figured after the Heat win they'd phone it in. Hope this is an indication this isn't the same Warriors team from before. Great win.
SNW::Is it not clear that Bazemore is playing too many minutes?? Every game there are instances where you just scratch your head and wonder if this guy even belong in the league.
Jupiter::This game was another example of the bench sucking beyond what anyone could expect. The starters played a lot last night as a high level and the bench needs to be able to take some pressure off them, but they failed miserably.
Jay Jay::What gets overlooked amid the heroics from Iggy and super-games from Steph and David Lee is the intense team D everyone is playing. That's what turned it around in the 4th tonight and what caused LeBron 8 turnovers last night. Everyone is hustling on D and making the extra play there.
Rodney::Unbelievable - Epic choke by the Hawks.
