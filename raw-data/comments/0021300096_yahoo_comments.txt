Cyril::Even though the Suns' record looks nice, their schedule tells the story.  This is their second game against New Orleans.  They also played Utah, Portland, and Denver.  Their losses understandably came against a Westbrook-less Thunder as well as the Spurs.  It's a good start for a young team, but there are plenty of losses looming on the horizon.
PhotoKent54::Looks like the Suns are playing their way out of the first pick and into the higher lottery picks.  How many of those four first round picks will be traded away?
Carlos::Ronnie M are you developmentally held touched? Dragic makes the difference against the good teams. He is able to create for himself and others. I am going to guess wherever you work you are probably not an asset. Good day.
Henry::Monty is one of the worst coaches in the league... his rotations are horrendous and he doesn't understand how to play match-ups.
shawn::Eric and Morris are straight ballin!
derek::for the sake of my fantasy team please put evens in.
j-rod::Westbrook DID play in the loss to the Thunder.  A game in OKC which the Suns led with under 6 minutes to go in, I might add.  Lost to the Spurs at San Antonio by 3... a game which they also led with under 1/2 the last quarter to go...
KHAR T::Suns are rolling
A1R::the suns is the biggest surprise so far this season. if they keep it up, coach hornacek might be coach of the yr and both eric bledsoe and miles plumlee are candidates for most improved player of the year. even markieff morris might be too.
MikeD::Anyone know a website that streams these games?....I wouldn't mind catching the end of this...
