debakes10::Big W for the bucks. They still made some dumb mistakes down the stretch that could of cost them, but nice win overall. Jennings and Monte need to keep it going. I really think they have one of the toughest backcourts in the league. If Irsan can get it going and Skiles and get a solid rotation pinned down, the buks are looking good
dorucevic::They say Pacers are 1st in defense points allowed ,there is no way Pacers are ranked that high after allowing a guy  to pour in 34 and he was scoring whenever he wanted.Makes no sense they dont have Ibaka on their team to say one of our players is the best defender
milwaukeemonster2::wtf happened to my 40 point blowout for da bucks?  ahh...pacers are flukey..  next time they wont be so lucky to lose by only 5..
BOOMBABY_3::Next time we will  have our full squad and it will be in indy.
marklenz24::Trade Ellis and Udoh for Tyson Chandler. Get a solid team playing big man and a real center and let Larry Play his PF game.
marklenz24::They might want to get rid of that 11 mil a year for 3 years contract though
IAMLEGEND_101::LOL KNICKS WOULD NEVER DO THIS TRADE. THEY DO NOT NEED ELLI S OR UDOH
marklenz24::Although we would not have a shooting gaurd then. How about Tyreke Evans and John Salmons for Monta and Dalambert?
panther4406::Lamb can play the 2
Miller Park After Dark::PROST!
panther4406::great gae jennings
KN_WisconsinFan::we sure beat those pacers
KN_WisconsinFan::yay bucks
TimmyHardawayJr10::But we HAVE to win these next three games. vs Utah, @NO and @CLE. Then Chicago at home will be huge
D.Wagner85::Good luck beating Utah, they are playing pretty well right now, you should beat the Hornets and Cavs though.
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Pacers are very good at home, but Utah does pose a lot of threats.
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::I say the Pacers go 2-1 in the next 3.  Too inconsistent to think otherwise.
TimmyHardawayJr10::I think they will go 3-0. But offensive efficiency will be key. I even think we will beat Chicago
TimmyHardawayJr10::What might not be a bad idea is start Mahinmi tomorrow over Hibbert. Maybe it will wake him up and start playing better. Just a thought
Hoosiers__1::Yeah. I wish we could give Mahinmi some of Roy's salary too haha. Hibbert hasn't been cutting it this season.
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::I agree.  If you can't make a damn bunny at 7'2'', you don't deserve to see the floor.  The problem is that he is getting paid 13 mil a season to miss bunnies.  That's not cutting it.
One Does Not Simply...::Wow Paul George and George Hill, can these names get any more generic?
D.Wagner85::We cannot all be named Ian Mahinmi and have our first name be pronounced Juan even though it is spelled Ian.
etony3314::His name could be George Paul.
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Yes they can.
devilrush20::Wasn't watching the game, but I saw that Hibbert only played 20 mins. Did his injury catch up to him in this game?
D.Wagner85::Ian Mahinmi played a very good game, hard to take a guy out when he is playing good.
xoxo Lakers24 xoxo::Lamborghini mercy, yo chick she so thirsty.
PeterPPK::Ok Brandon, this was good. Now, we just need you to have this kind of night three or four out of every five games. Can you do it? We're counting on you.
etony3314::Do you think Jennings should be dealt this year?
etony3314::You'd be trading Jennings, Ellis, Udrih, Lamb (4) and getting back Gordon, Rivers, Fredette, Vasquez, Roberts (5). Evans would probably start at SF like he did last year.
D.Wagner85::etony3314 - You don't like Tyreke?  I think he is ok, but if he hits his peak, he will be what Monta Ellis is.  we would have 10 guards on the team, how can you win that way?
etony3314::You don't like Tyreke?
D.Wagner85::etony3314 - That might work. I got an even bigger one though:  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=cyqgx57  If the Bucks want to lose 60 games a year for the next 5 years that would be a great deal.  I think the Bucks want to get better though.
etony3314::That might work. I got an even bigger one though:  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=cyqgx57
D.Wagner85::I think it is just to big, I would consider this:  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=cou35ts
etony3314::Well, it would enable Monta to play PG, or they could trade Monta in a separate deal and go with Gordon/Vasquez/Rivers.
D.Wagner85::I wouldn't do it, no reason to trade guard for guard, my guess is Bucks would package Jennings with Gooden and either Dalembert (expiring) or Harris (bright future) to get a true low post scorer.  Possibly Al Jefferson, or someone like Big AL
etony3314::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=cybyprm   This is what I came up with earlier...I think it would work for both teams.
D.Wagner85::I think they can get a lot for him, but I feel if they trade him it will ruin fan support, and they will need fan support if they want to get a new arena.  Games like this are the reason you want to keep him, if he finds a way to play like this each game, the Bucks are a legit team in the East.
D.Wagner85::Watch the Bucks game tomorrow lol, Bucks will lose by at least 20 in Memphis, Jennings and Ellis will be 9-35 from the field.    Hoping for a win, but those two play bad on the road against good teams.
MasterOfLogic::This mediocre play from the Pacers doesn't surprise me actually...  Yankee choke in playoffs... Eagles epically choke again, Jets suck and choke all the time.... now the Pacers can't play up to expectations.... I apologize to the Pacers for being a fan to their franchise.
etony3314::It's one game and your team is over .500 and right around first place without their best player and with others struggling to find their way. Relax.
Hoosierhawk_18::You're a fan of the Pacers? Really hard to tell by your comments
MasterOfLogic::Plus, Rutgers and Kansas State blow it.
Hoosierhawk_18::Since when is it a shock that Rutgers blows?
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::You can go be a Heat fan.  No one really cares.
D.Wagner85::I still doubt Granger comes back and has the effect Pacer fans feel he has.  You will be a playoff team, but you will not finish ahead of the Bucks or Bulls in the standings.  You have to rely on Psycho T's little brother, that will not lead to success.
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Ben Hans was a great spark in this game.
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::etony3314 - No, but you would have Hibbert, West, Granger, George, Hill, and Collison. What's your starting lineup?  Hill or Collison.  Vogel went with the hot hand last year and that was effective until Collison went down with an injury and then Hill took over the majority of the minutes.
etony3314::No, but you would have Hibbert, West, Granger, George, Hill, and Collison. What's your starting lineup?
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Lance Stepenson will.
etony3314::Well, that would be fine now with Granger's injury...but with a healthy Granger, does Hill back up both guard spots?
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Yes.  DC wanted to start though.  The Pacers moved the other direction by signing Hill to the 5 year extension.  I like Hill, but he can play the 1 and 2.  It was possible to have DC and Hill.
etony3314::Do you think you guys should have kept Collison?
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::When the only option is freaking DEEJAY AUGUSTIN I do.  DEEJAY is a failure.
D.Wagner85::So you feel confident in him the rest of the season then?
WIstormchaser2119::HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY SEXY LADY
up4keeps2323::You Pacer fans are real good with your predicitions...
up4keeps2323::Im referring to the colts and BAC guys
Hoosierhawk_18::The two teams are about equal of talent, Granger probably puts Pacers above Bucks in terms of talent, no one said it would be a walk in the park.
up4keeps2323::Nah, yall were just sooo sure on how bad the Bucks were that this game was a walk in the park and youre 0-2 this year so far
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::My prediction was 91-85.  I love when fans play the "us against the world" mentality on a message board.
Hoosierhawk_18::Are you really going to try and call people out for supporting their team after a close game?
TimmyHardawayJr10::Let the bucks enjoy their time now. It's only mid December. we all know in 4 months who will be in the playoffs. Pacers baby!
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Yup.  Pacers fans are terrible at predicting the future.
TimmyHardawayJr10::I'm not gonna be too worried. Once Granger comes back, he'll free up George, West, and Hibbert will thrive. We'll be jockeying for top 4 seed come April. Just need to stay around 3 games back of 4th place before Grangers back. Thoughts?
Notre Dame 2013 National Champions::Whatever man best of luck to you, the bulls, and d-rose
etony3314::I'm not a Bulls fan.
Notre Dame 2013 National Champions::Miami and New York are way better
etony3314::Miami is obviously a threat to repeat, but the Knicks are old, injury prone, and too dependent on the 3. With Chicago's defense, that will be shut down.
Notre Dame 2013 National Champions::It'd be stupid for him to come back/. If I'm a Bulls fan I want him to be extra careful. There is no title shot this year anyway
TimmyHardawayJr10::Or he could continue to get injured. I hate to say it, but he is injury prone.
etony3314::How do you figure? Deng and Noah are better than ever, they look like they might have something in Marco Belinelli, Boozer is off and on, Jimmy Butler and Taj Gibson are emerging, Nate Robinson can provide a spark off the bench...and you're forgetting, he's Derrick f***ing Rose. He'll have two months to get fully healthy, and will make an Adrian Peterson-like return. Many athletes report that after ACL surgery, their knee ends up stronger than it was before the injury. They most certainly do have a shot.
zachsim::if you think Granger....Danny Granger is gonna be the all mighty god and turn this into a top 4 team in the East in a blink, you are dreaming. He'll help but it is not gonna be overnight as you make it out to be.
TimmyHardawayJr10::The east isn't that strong. As long as we hang around, he'll make a big enough impact to put in top 4
Notre Dame 2013 National Champions::Rose isn't coming back this year
etony3314::He'll be back around the All-Star break. His rehab is coming along wonderfully. That's wishful thinking on your part.
etony3314::Yes he is.
PacoMolato::definitely true, they are still doing well with an unexperienced team (minus west), Granger added 18 points and helped defend bigger small forwards. George doesn't need to do as much ball handling as he is now. They need to utilize Green and Augustine more.
MasterOfLogic::February... Pacers will be out of the playoff race by that time.
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Um.  No.
Notre Dame 2013 National Champions::Agree. We should finish ahead of Chicago and Milwaukee with a fully healthy roster. Pg: Hill Sg: George Sf: Granger Pf: West C: Hibbert  Best line up in the central this year
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::I disagree. The Bulls are better when Rose comes back.
Rexanilatorz::Agreed
Hoosierhawk_18::Just about anything will be better for Hibbert than the way he has played so far this season
etony3314::I hear Darren Collison's available.
Hoosierhawk_18::True, I'm just frustrated we gave him a max contract. Hope it doesn't hinder them from signing PG long term
etony3314::Well, maybe not. But I'd rather have someone like Tony Allen than someone like Monta Ellis, especially when there are other scorers on the team already.
Hoosierhawk_18::You don't give max contracts to guys who can't score the ball at a good clip
etony3314::He's never been a scorer...the rest of his game is fine.
yosemite noah.::Travis best &gt; hill
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Oh gawd no.
D.Wagner85::Best hit clutch shots for the Pacers.
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Only against the Bucks.  Like one time in his career.
BigHandsomeHoosier1991::Too many TO's.......and Roy was awful.
Mosaic_Moot152915::DRAFT TIME:  http://tinyurl.com/free-nba-entry
Hoosierhawk_18::Double double, fairly productive night for Paul George, wish it had come in a victory though
D.Wagner85::D.Wagner85 - Bucks have been in a funk for sure, but a division game against a hated rival over the last 2-3 seasons will have them primed and ready to go.  Bucks win this game 98-93 in a great fought division match up.  How crazy is that prediction guys, honestly, give me props Bucks fans :)
TehGame::actuallly 6-4 and 4 games in a row an dthen 1 loss then a win is not a funk lol.
D.Wagner85::Actually learn to look at the schedule, 5-5 GOING INTO THIS GAME, AS I STATED  Losses to Clippers, Spurs, T'wolves, Hornets and Knicks.  Wins against Cavs, Kings, Bobcats, Nets, and Celtics.
TehGame::Bucks are 5 and 1 in the last 6 games... Some funk lol
D.Wagner85::and 5-5 in our last 10 going into the game.
squiddy45::There is an edit button
squiddy45::You cared enough to go all the way back to copy and paste. I don't think a quick edit is out of the question
D.Wagner85::Ok, do not believe I could give a rats $@%.
PacoMolato::not true.
D.Wagner85::D.Wagner85 Bucks have been in a funk for sure, but a division game against a hated rival over the last 2-3 seasons will have them primed and ready to go.    Bucks win this game 98-93 in a great fought division match up. 4 Hours Ago
D.Wagner85::What is not true?
MasterOfLogic::Sorry, but anybody can beat the Pacers...
D.Wagner85::Doesn't matter, I just love the fact I predicted the score.
Justin01553::Sucks when one team relies on one player to win games means the GM is not doing their job
Chuck Spears::There are so many divisions these days even the Bucks can be 2nd in theirs.
Justin01553::Bucks are a lot better than most people think
MasterOfLogic::Pacers:  Rebounding: OVERRATED Defense: OVERRATED, UNCLUTCH Offense: We already know it SUCKS
dorucevic::thats true its like they are lazy.especially on offense they suck cant score.stats show they 1st or 3rd in defense there is no way you are that good on defense if your record is 13-12 1 game over 500 no way
TimmyHardawayJr10::This team is so damn frustrating. Why am I still watching them. I'll watch them more often when Granger comes back. We need his scoring presence
packersfanfrom89::Big win tonight.  Any night in 1st place is a good night.
azehr31::anybody but the bulls in first is fine with me
yosemite noah.::Second

Notre Dame 2013 National Champions::too far bruh
colts8733::didn't the Pacers beat the Bulls?
buckspackers23::Lol, Pacers didn't chase and foul just so the Bucks don't reach 100.
azehr31::and it wouldnt have done any good
colts8733::good game bucks, needed to hit our free throws and West missed I believe 4 of them
buckspackers23::Between Jennings, Ellis, Gooden and Dunleavy I believe they missed 8, and they're good free throw shooters.
Notre Dame 2013 National Champions::Good game Milwaukee. Best of luck
MasterOfLogic::Pacers:  Rebounding: OVERRATED Defense: OVERRATED Offense: We all know it SUCKS already
nategauvain::all teh pacers are good for are crushing when I bet against them

nategauvain::nd a 26 footer with sum1 running at you with the shot clock at  0 is nto a good look learn basketball
nategauvain::bad coaching ne good coach makes sure they get a shot off with 30 plus left regardless
Notre Dame 2013 National Champions::to get the open look they got instead of jacking up a tough look
buckspackers23::Good game Pacers! I love our match-up. Always seem to be good games.
Notre Dame 2013 National Champions::yup you held your ground at home. hope we can do the same
