Lebron--swept in the finals-- James::f
Nash_Memph_ville::I can't help but laugh at all the trash Toronto fans were talking about memphis for trading away Rudy gay..  Buyer beware..
NY NBK Far Superior x.::t
joeonthego2426::Everybody is talking about injuries but give some credit to the bench and Kmart for the rebounding that they are lacking without Tyson Chandler and Amare Stoudemire. And give some credit 4 the athleticism of j.r. smith as he becomes the leading scorer w/o melo.
Miami Are Champs::i guess this makes the knicks champions congrats
Nayrock10::Sheed is out so why woody can't find any 1 to play for the playoff
Esula414::if sheed played it be over for da heat
EasyRun18::Where's the $16 mil-man Rudy Gay, only 14min 4pts? $800k Anderson played 36min 35pts.
SRQisLegend::bernard king would have been the best knick ever if not for injuries
50stm::Marshmello throws up 31  shots. does this make him the best guard in the game?
vplaskan1::Well 1st off he plays PF, not guard, 2nd when a player is dominating the whole 2nd half of a game, and the other team has no answer for him, it is very smart basketball to continue to feature him, that is just basketball in its most simplistic form.
Knicks4Life244::Its always nice seeing the trolls back on the boards
BigPhilly517::Yes sir... That's how you know we winning again.
ezeddie65::"Melo, bro, 31 shots and noone else on the team gets over 10???? You can't win a championship that way"  Kobe Bryant
vplaskan1::So if one guy is completely dominating the game in the 2nd half, and the other team has no answer for him, you are actually saying you wouldn't want that guy to shoot the basketball? I wouldn't recommend you taking up coaching basketball.
RoidRage1986::melo 31shots next highest total was 10. way to play team bball melo you cant play the raps every night.
vplaskan1::37 points, and he was dominating the whole 2nd half, Toronto had no answer for him. Do you guys actually watch the games?
raddreamer3kx::Lol, you think these dudes watch, all they do is troll and talk out a.rse on espn boards.
SportsHero94::Who the hell is Alan Anderson? I swear every time i watch a knicks games vs Toronto this guy kills us.
EnglandCoinedSoccer::And in typical New York sport fashion the Knicks will be eliminated during the KO stage.
CUBUFFSPAC10::hey knicks fans keep Melo, he sucks and you're done in the first round again. f-you new york
jack frrom the titanic::I rold to soo, Melo not nice  Lin
spencer7111::good luck beating the thunder
Dawan208::I guarentee the Rockets will get further in the playoffs then the Knicks. Then again Knicks are in the ecf.
jack frrom the titanic::Knicks have no young players to build upon.....this is a bogus team
jack frrom the titanic::Melo now gets injured when the knicks play the better teams and makes a recovery aginst the bottom feeders.....he is not a New Yorker
Jamaal 43::I see the knicks making a run heading into the playoffs; lets go knicks!!
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Yup. Barely scraping past the Raptors based on the Refs makes you a title favorite!!!!!!  NEW YORK KNICKS. LESS SUCCESS IN THE PLAYOFFS THAN THE RAPTORS IN THE LAST 10 YEARS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Dawan208::Landry Fields is having a new baby with Model Elaine Alden.   Life is good for him,  to bad his bb  skills suck!
Rocketswin2013::Carmelo was agressive.
pasinpman::K-Mart with 11 rebounds? have to admit that isn't bad.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::He dominated our Rookie centre Jonas Valencionas and our coach is to dumb to pull him out and put Amir Johnson on him.
Jamaal 43::Adding him was a good pick; what took them so long? Now if they stop playing and West the knicks can beat any team.
imgainingweight::Hello there Ny, chitown here if we meet in the 1st round are yall confident in the knicks?
Timothy7870::Are you confident in those sliding Bulls, who's star does not want to play?
jcsny::Knicks still getting knocked out first round.

SatanForTheWin::sigh...... southpark was right
Gatoralumn1950::The Knicks are the only team that scares me.  I really don't think that my Heat can beat them in a 7 game series
SRQisLegend::dude did you graduate in 1950 or were you born that year?
jack frrom the titanic::Knicks future never looked so good
Eden Knight::1st or 2nd round playoff exit. Won't reach ECF.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::This board is done.  @Satan---I understand why no one knows your and why your account was created on March 20. You are a troll. I have advice for you thought.

Mets-Jets-Knicks-Isles19::The Melo hate gets worse the more he scores
vplaskan1::If he scored 50 points, hit the game winning shot, and carried the Knicks to a victory, someone would come on here and say... "Melo only had one ast.", cause you know that is Melo's job, to get a lot of ast., the hate for Melo always amazes me.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::If Melo scored 50 and hit the winning shot he would get respect
vplaskan1::Oh no now the internet tough guy is getting on me... what do I do now?
