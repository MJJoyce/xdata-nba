blackglobesoul::C' we need this win 2nite
KeithStone.x443::The Celtics keeping piling up road wins...oh wait  Do playoff teams have to travel?
nhraven5200::Dont worry Boston, youll get tha 8th seed soon enough.
_I Am A Celtic_::It's funny because you think that scares us.  Meanwhile, a lot of fans here are looking forward to facing the heat.  Did you even read what Terry said?  Get a clue
MAYAN-ARE-RIGHT-HEAT-FANS-ARE-STUPID-::nhraven5200 - Terry's only good at launching prayer 3's, mostly from half court  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
nhraven5200::Terry's only good at launching prayer 3's, mostly from half court
KeithStone.x443::A lot of Celtics fans are retahded too
DRedsfan10::Lebron ruined JT's return to Dallas 2 a few days ago!
26Stanley::This isn't 2008.I know it is going to be a while before the Celtics are serious contenders again.But, if we rebuild now it will be one year sooner.
HeatOriginal::Told you guys, Jeff Green is a one hit wonder. It will never happen again.
flybye23::you sure cause Celtic fans were saying he was the next Bird, Mchale, Parrish rolled into one and would average over 40 the rest of the season.  right PPownsRondo ???
PP owns Rondo::I never said that. Quit lying flybye.
Eg214::No Matter what Jason Terry says Or does his heart is in dallas and it looks like it by the way he plays for the celtics. JT was our Second best Player Very Clutch and would put up 20+ almost every night
Someone Crushed my Peaches::Did Terry ever average 20.0ppg as Maveraick?
Eg214::He did 08-09 season, 6th man of the Year. &amp; average 18 points in the playoffs in 2011
LarryBirdsJock33::Further evidence that this team either doesn't have what it takes or needs new leadership across the board. I'm tired. It's fine if BB, PP, and KG all score 16 points, but Jeff Green or Jason Terry have to go for 25 + on those nights! They should have dealt PP and the draft pick for Josh Howard.
Eg214::Your 2 best players in Garnet and Pierce are not in their prime no more its all it is
LarryBirdsJock33::I'm sorry, I''m grateful for what PP has done during his years in green, but to say that he HAS to retire as a Celtic is RIDICULOUS!!!! He's no Bill Russell, Hondo, or Larry Bird. If you don't have one of those names and at least 3 rings on your resume, there should be no guarantees. We've got to start doing what is best for the future of the franchise before we don't have one.
flybye23::and the hang over continues !!!   lmao.   that Heat loss is really still stinging huh ???  back to back losses against sorry teams !!!  lmao.  barely above .500 record.  let the excuse train roll on in.......
Syrindge::test
Syrindge::Been looking forward to a Celtics/Heat series all year. The only way it looks like that will happen is if the c's tank and get the #8 seed. Let the tanking begin!!!!
NowitzkiHasAlwaysOwnedGarnett::^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
_I Am A Celtic_:::/
Ivanov21::So the +/- stat suggests that everybody came onto the court, got a 3 pointer right in their face , then got benched for the remainder of the game. Interesting!
JosephMcGreal700::If there was an agreement between the Celts (Rivers) and Mavs (Carlisle) that the Dallas fans should get a chance to honor Terry and a standing ovation would suffice, they could have planned it better. Like say start Terry and get it over with right away. But why do anything for the fans? They only pay for EVERYTHING!
texasghost2014::Well...the Mavs may not make the playoffs...but Dallas Morning News is reporting that Dirk's wife maybe pregnant.    See...there's a little positive in everything.  :)
texasghost2014::I'm straight.  I don't read gossip websites.
sportsreality::That's been on gossip sites for several weeks.
Rezo201::C's are slippin'.
ALLforthelulz::Jet thrives in games like this, he needed more than 22 minutes IMO
flybye23::he probably couldnt do more than 22 mins due to the pain from THE DUNK  a few night ago, lmao
Eg214::Just delete ur account
sportsreality::Can Britne Griner go through the NBA draft?
john mayer can play the hell out of that geetar::she plays better defense than irk
LetsGoMavs-::hey look the spurs troll is back. Go back to watching your boring spurs
sportsreality::She plays better than 60% of all NBA players.
sportsreality::Is it possible for the Mavs to draft Britne Griner.  I guarantee you that he can play in the NBA.  I'm sorry, she.
MikeMamba21::He's 6'8
sportsreality::Who?  Britne?
LetsGoMavs-::Mavs need a center big time. She/he would be better than Kaman
sportsreality::Would the NBA allow her to go through the draft?
sportsreality::That's so true.  She would knock Kaman out in practice.
sportsreality::It's really funny that the Mavs keep losing and they have a very average team, but they still have a very good chance of making the playoffs.  Since we haven't been in this position in a long time, is this the way it is for teams at the bottom of the division every year?  I guess there are always a few average teams that squeak into the playoffs.  I would never have guessed that the Mavs with no point guard, with no center, and with Dirk out for 27 games would ever come close to making the playoffs.
manoocena::Always inferior to the Spurs, that must just suck for you guys.
LetsGoMavs-::Sucks we win games but not making the playoffs. I wish Dirk didn't miss the first 30 games and was healthy. I promise to you Mavs will be a top 4 seed next year.  Sad to say but their 12 consecutive playoff streak since 2000 will come to an end this year
sportsreality::Yeah, I agree.
MikeMamba21::Where do you guys see Memphis going in the playoffs?
LetsGoMavs-::2nd round if they vs the Clippers in the 1st round
sportsreality::Out in the 2nd round.  They were once very good, but Denver has taken away their thunder.
Dribbird.::I'm out.   Later.    And C's better remember how to defend the pick and roll tomorrow.
LetsGoMavs-::25 year old Mayo needs to change from SG to a PG.
sportsreality::What about his turnovers and the fact that he gets nervous when the game is on the line?
Oakcliff972::ITS CALLED NUTTING UP
LetsGoMavs-::Yes he needs to work on that part in the summer
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Mayo needs a consistent jumper.
LetsGoMavs-::He needs to learn how to play with Dirk like how Jet played with Dirk. He was good when Dirk didn't play early in the season
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::but I see where you are going.
garnolfini::Celtics are finished at a contender in the EC for years.
LarryBirdsJock33::Did you see Ray on Monday night? Not even a factor. We don't need him, neither do the Heat.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::You're not too bright.
Dribbird.::bet you said that last year.
Dribbird.::If you say so
garnolfini::Time is up for KG and PP. Rondo and 4  scrubs is the immediate future.
Dribbird.::Did you watch Ray last year?  Love what he did for Boston but his time was up.
garnolfini::they had Ray last year.
Dribbird.::Jet may not be living up to expectations.  But if we lose him...  who would replace his scoring off the bench?
LetsGoMavs-::He is with the Celtics for 2 more years
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Our whole game plan is based off defense. JET ruins that regardless of his PPG avg.
LetsGoMavs-::Don't know why Jet is playing bad with the Celtics.
sportsreality::A lot has to do with chemistry and the way the team plays.  Jet has not fit in well with the offensive scheme of the Celtics.  He worked well with Dirk and Kidd.  None of them are having a great year without each other.  Sometimes team dynamics are everything.
LetsGoMavs-::yea that also lol
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::part has to do with age imo.
MikeMamba21::If the Mavs make the playoffs, our chances of getting Mayo becomes a lot lower
outspoken mavs fan::i dont really like Mayo.. it just me
sportsreality::He's too inconsistent and he gets too nervous when playing superstars or other really good teams.  Plus he really panics at the end of games.  I understand his fear, but it has cost us at least 4 or 5 games.
LetsGoMavs-::you're not alone
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::ARe you a Laker fan or C's fan?
MikeMamba21::I'm a C's fan
LetsGoMavs-::Why? It's not like OJ been playing that great lately. He might pick up the player option and prove others wrong to get a better contract next year  Mavs would be a playoff team right now IMO if Dirk didn't miss the first 30 games of the season
sportsreality::Agreed. Mayo is not all of that to me.  He's an above average player at best.
MikeMamba21::I just doubt his interest in staying in Dallas would go down,  The Mavs would be in a completely different situation if Dirk was healthy in the beginning of the season.  Not saying they'd be a powerhouse but they'd be in a more "comfortable" posistion
sportsreality::Nice to see Jet tonight, but like he said, "he's a Celtic now."  I hope he does like Derrick Harper and comes back to work for the Mavs someday.  Good win Mavs.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Take Jason Terry back.
sportsreality::That's why Cuban wouldn't pay him that big salary.  Isn't it funny how players can suck at one team and get traded for big dollars to another team.  It's like the teams' management doesn't watch other teams play.  Jet has hugh scoring slumps, Kidd is not a scorer, Haywood can't play center.  Just FYI for their new teams.  They should all get traded with disclaimers shouldn't they.
beebopbaloop::Love how much faith you have in JET.  Ashamed to say I don't feel that way anymore. =(
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Not for 5 M
sportsreality::No we love him but you can keep him.  We knew that he had scoring slumps for long periods of time.  If the Lakers can send us Odom and Fisher, we have the right to send you Jet.  He'll really come through in the playoffs though.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::It's not enough for me.
Dribbird.::He's averaging 10ppg as a second scoring option off the bench.  That's solid
Dribbird.::Mavs completely outplayed Boston to night.  Good win for them.
sportsreality::What the heck is all this conversation about?  Isn't it supposed to be about the Mavs and the Celtics.  Go somewhere else to talk about March Madness, MLB, and all that other crap.
nuneee2::i know right? no way Kansas is beating UNC with the way they looked tonight
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Oh, I'm sorry. Are you the ESPN mod Na              zi?
sportsreality::Yeap.  It was just kind of confusing.  I thought I had clicked the wrong link.
Dribbird.::no.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Kobe's not ripping his teammates. Surprising.
Dribbird.::Maybe he knows they don't have a chance
duke_mavs_panthers_braves_::good win mavs. Lakers also lost!
nuneee2::wow the Mavs might actually make the playoffs... 2 out in the loss column with a game left against the Lakers
Dribbird.::And the AFC East will be boring once again this year.  I'm expecting another 6-0 or 5-1 year in the division.  I really wish someone wouldn't suck for once.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Better knock on wood.
Dribbird.::But I'm hoping it's competitive.   Makes the season more interesting.
Dribbird.::But I'm actually hoping it's competitive.   It makes the season more interesting.
PP owns Rondo::RG3 is injury prone, Cam isn't.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::RGIII is Rondo like. Plays through almost everything. Love the heart.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::NOOOOO! That dummy coach did. Athletes always do that. It was Shanahan's fault.
PP owns Rondo::Stupid more like it. He cost Washington their playoff game by not coming out early.
Dribbird.::AFC North is the Bengals to lose this year.   The Ravens were absolutely gutted, the Steelers are dropping fast and the Browns are the Browns.  Not even Dalton should be an excuse in that division.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::It's all on Dalton, getting a strong second receiver and building theO line.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Just read your comments. RGIII made the playoffs last year and much of it was due to his play. His completion % was unreal. He's a better QB.
PP owns Rondo::No, Cam was drafted to a worse team. His career will be better than RG3.
PP owns Rondo::Nope
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::You agree?
PP owns Rondo::Yep
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::RGIII is faster, a better passer and better decision maker. Just being honest. Cam is better than Dalton. I'll quit saying that.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Nope.
PP owns Rondo::UK Read my comments below on Cam and respond.
PP owns Rondo::Mets haven't been good in a long while.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I know you are Metropolitan. I just know it.
PP owns Rondo::Yes, I love the Mets but they've sucked lately.
Dribbird.::I really think the Red Sox will suck again this year :/
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I don't mind the Sox. I hate the Yankees.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Don't be mad:   WS prediction: Reds v. Angels  SB: Broncos v. GB
Dribbird.::I'm mad.
gunsup14::UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown - Manning to Welker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't wait to see that. And I'm glad Amendola is at a team that can compete
Dribbird.::In a different system every couple years with a rotating offensive line and lots of different sets of receivers ;)
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Brady is a system QB. JK
Dribbird.::madder
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Manning to Welker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Keith, did you re-sign Dickey?
MikeMamba21::Mets have such a great farm system, they just have been bad at transitioning to the Big Leagues.  Either they get plagued by injury or it's just poor management.  I've been a Mets fan longer than i've been a fan of any team in sports, it's just too frustrating.
PP owns Rondo::No, Mets are dumb. Management needs to be fired.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Horrible decision.
Dribbird.::Nah.  He's on the Blue Jays now
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::lolmets
MikeMamba21::How long do you give John Wall in D.C.?
MikeMamba21::yup that's the problem, what team do you see him going too? I keep thinking of the Nuggets they could start him  at SG, and move Iggy to small forward.
MikeMamba21::I'd like to see him with the C's as a 6th man
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::he's max contract.
Dribbird.::When is his contract up?
MikeMamba21::his contract is up after next season
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::He's gone as soon as the contract is over.
PP owns Rondo::Panthers vs Dolphins  2014 Superbowl  You heard it here 1st.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::And last
Dribbird.::Fins?   no way
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::But you can't tell me Cam is better than RGIII. You just can't do it.
PP owns Rondo::I can.  Cam has a Heisman trophy, national championship trophy, Rookie of the year and beat RG3 head to head last season.
Dribbird.::Gotta see how RGXXI's knee is next year
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I would troll but we kind of suck right now.
Dribbird.::Yea.  We go through this sh*t every couple months.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::It's different this year. We really suck.
MikeMamba21::NYGGAS CAN'T HANDLE JOHN WALL
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Close.
Dribbird.::So, I completely am picked the Panthers as my sleeper team for next season.
PP owns Rondo::Carolina Panthers?  Shut up UK
Dribbird.::Yea.
Dribbird.::If I am wrong, I will blame PP owns Rondo
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Cam sucks
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Shhh.
Dribbird.::Nah Cams a beast.  He just needs someone to throw to.
PP owns Rondo::Lakers will lose
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Pretty much now.
