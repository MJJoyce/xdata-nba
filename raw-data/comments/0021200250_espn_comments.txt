JJATLJJ48::I personally wanted O-town to bomb all season so we could get a lottery pick and get another Howard type player... guess it isn't going to happen though.   No superstars or anywhere near it on this team, we need someone big. Like that they're competing already though with a nearly brand new team but as is it'll never go anywhere.
royalblue4life::JJ Redick's assists are a thing of beauty. His passes are almost always delivered to his teammates in scoring position. He is really a sound player.
csmeech::Labored? Outlasted? Did you even watch the game?  They scored 102. They ran all night. If you are going to write about the game you should watch it.
kbell140::JJ for 6th man of the year!
Elton7323::do u think harrington will make a huge impact for the magic or not just asking he seems more consistant than turk.
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::I think he'll only play for about a month or two before he's traded. He's a pretty good team defender &amp; will def. help out on offense. But his tenure with the Magic will be short lived. He's basically trade bait.
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::Most likely picks.
asdbluecfl::What do you think they'll trade him for, picks or a solid PG?
Kev_010::like i said another UPSET!
BudokaiJones::...
dwight howards free throw academy::If we can get past Utah tomorrow, we have winnable games vs Sac and Pho.  Lets get to 10-10 !
ChompChompFL::Afflalo's had two good games in a row, good to see him stepping up.
charlie hustle bets the over::truly miss him over here in denver.    such a humble cat, too.
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::What's funny is Warriors fans were SOOOOOOOOO confident they'd win.
dwight howards free throw academy::Orlando was supposed to be so tired and unable to run all game!
BudokaiJones::love the sn
heatfaninfl::Been using a betting system called sportsbettingstar. ive made around $3,000 a month the past couple of months using this system. If you bet on sports you can find this system on google by searching for sports betting system.
sportsfan1014::wow.. Orlando won again, must be magic
ssj2gokuvsgallade::Lol. A Wizard's fan.
palsy360::It is Dwight Howard, now go work on your free throws
Heltons03::Brook Lopez and 4 first round draft picks.
D.J Mbenga::This Magic team is a fluke. They're going nowhere
csmeech::The fluke is that you were able to put enough words together to form a complete sentence
sean75779::huge Magic fan here, no doubt this is a fluke however, maybe the Magic are not a bottom feeder like a lot of us thought. Im just enjoying this for the time being.
Telkalynn3013::Seven other teams thought they were a fluke too.
dumdum2150::GSW 3 games over .500 now THAT'S A FLUKE!
asdbluecfl::There not good, but there not bad either. More inconsisitant if anything.
dumdum2150::For those wondering why Magic have losing record. Remember we have 4 rookies,10 new players,a new coach,and only 2 months together. I think given all that a 7 and 10 record is pretty good.
EnnBee15::Don't forget injuries to Jameer and Hedo.   Magic are 6-4 when Jameer plays. 6-1 when he doesn't. Is that a fluke?
MagicBoltzRays::1-6 in games without Nelson*
grandmaster297::That makes no sense at all.
asdbluecfl::Basically a brand new team.
jakman73::should have been 3 my bad:)
jakman73::Two Syllables .....dis appointing
asdbluecfl::Nice win by magic, played with alot of intensity on the 4th. Need to see that at Amway more often. Vucevic is really filling in, I hope he keeps it up and grows some confidence.
ManchesterUnited1Fan1::a MUST read! check it out! http://isportslife.wordpress.com/2012/11/27/nba-transactions-or-reality-tv/
JrueRandallHoliday::Good indeed... nice share!
ArjunCelticsFan::great read on LBJ vs Melo vs Howard. Everyone must read it! http://isportslife.wordpress.com/2012/11/27/nba-transactions-or-reality-tv/
Telkalynn3013::THE MAGIC ARE NOBODY'S HOMECOMING TEAM!!  Keep sleeping on them.  Jacque Vaughn early coach of the year award!
xx3825::Redick is 28, Klay is 22
WarriorsWarrior::Fair enough!
WarriorsWarrior::Would you trade redick 4 klay?
Rolltide4203::nah hes so much younger. It would be a really poor move.
WarriorsWarrior::redick look good. good passer instincts
xx3825::I wouldn't trade Klay.
FriscoWarriors415::no
jakman73::Iam talking through my wallet, but warriors you suck a phat one!!, should have put them away, glad i backed up at the half...magic simply outplayed them, will suprise a fe teams this year!!
jakman73::true....could be worse and brag how i made a mint.....which i didnt, but degenerate is a bit harsh....down under in Aus we say stupid Bast@#D
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::well at least you're honest about being a degenerate gambler
MagicBoltzRays::The Magic only have 13 B2B's this year. seems pretty low.
sandiegonation::magic fans might hate me for being a laker fan but im happy for them, I hope they do well.
palsy360::We know u are Dwight Howard
BudokaiJones::Too many opposing teams are drinking the koolaid that the Magic should be this years version of the Bobcats and don't realize that this team can play when they get hot. Don't sleep on the Magic.
Rolltide4203::Like my comment if u think the Magic will make the playoffs.
Rolltide4203::I cant see it.. Lets be honest, stanford is average, they lost to washington. Look at some of their results. Usc is absolutely awful, and even worse with a terrible freshman qb. A lot of self destruction or they lose that one. Oklahoma not very good either. They are a solid team but I would be shocked if they win
Rolltide4203::U think Alabama will get crushed by a team who beat Pittsburgh by 3 in overtimes, based on a missed 30 yarder by Pitt? Yeah I'm sure the 10 pt favorite will get "crushed"
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::same team that beat Stanford, and manhandled USC and Oklahoma at their house... and no im just kidding about crushing Alabama, but I do think Bama loses
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::i liked your comment because I think Alabama gets crushed in the NC
Rolltide4203::Most people consider them to have the worst roster in the nba. I disagree I think they can make it.
xx3825::definitely, they have a lot of talent on that team
xx3825::J.J. Redick looked like Ray Allen and Reggie Miller's love child tonight, dude couldn't miss
JustinTimeHeHe::T'was a boring day in the NBA. 6 games, all worthlss to watch. Tomorrow will be better tho. Need the Nets and Rockets to lose
Rolltide4203::does anyone know when turk and al harrington will be back? They could definitely use them
Jacque Vaughn vs The World::^ They'll want to develop Nicholson as the backup 4 and leave Davis as the starter, if he isn't traded by New Years I'd be surprised.
vmcmillan2::Harrington might be trade bait
Rolltide4203::turkoglu is def a starter no question. But I dont know about harrington, Im sure he would be the sixth man.
vmcmillan2::idk but it will nice, will they come off the bench?
diego3494::clippers in  first place  in  the pacific division cant wait to get my revenge on u lames -chris paul
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::I am Encouraged though by the Warriors team.. they no longer lose for lack of talent, they're losing because of lack of hustle and/or execution.
JustinTimeHeHe::I have my own business.. just opened up my own Lemonade stand on the corner of East-Lenox and 45th. It's in the ghetto but it's some really good Lemonade so stop by, we're bring a cup right to your car, you dont even hafto get out. $3.50 for a small
JustinTimeHeHe::Why don't we just say $@%! the lemonade and you give me a dollar?
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::Rich Bucher is a very 'interesting' looking dude.
TheCronoMasterMind::See you guys Wednesday Magic fans! Let's take down the Jazz and move this win streak to 3!
xx3825::PG Jameer Nelson SG J.J. Redick SF Aaron Afflalo PF Glen Davis C Nikola Vucevic  That lineup is on fire at the moment.
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::trade for the Polish Hammer and now you're talking
MagicBoltzRays::Harkless has been starting. JJ off the bench.
xx3825::yup
vmcmillan2::that was the 4th quarter finishing move
xx3825::I know.
vmcmillan2::will hedo come off the bench?
karelp::I keep trying to tell my fellow Warrior fans that Klay Thompson is not good enough to be a starting shooting guard.  He's terribly inefficient and does nothing else well on the court.  Maybe, someday they'll believe me.  The Warriors keep drafting guys like him, and that's why they've been one of the worst franchizes in the NBA for almost 20 years now.
Drun2400::So tell me what Nba team you are the Gm for again? I seemed to have miss that...
karelp::So only GMs can judge talent?  I could provide you with the list of players I've evaluated, and the accuracy with which I've done it, but nothing would convince you.  All my friends know how good I am though.  However, maybe you'll remember a couple years form now some guy you thought was a jerk on these boards told you Thompson would never be very good.
Rolltide4203::No Thompson is a very good player. He will be fine.
ChrisHall SMD::Trust me...He will get better as the season progresses...
karelp::I've been playing and/or coaching basketball for the last 40 years, and I just don't think he's that good.  His shot has way too much arc on it, and he doesn't get to the line.  He'll always be an inefficient scorer.  On top of that, he's not quick enough defensively to be a good defender.  I could be wrong, but usually I'm very good at judging talent when I've seen players play in college.
ChrisHall SMD::Hes a quality player...He just had a rough start...
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::Greg Pappa saying this was worst loss of the year.. H.ell NO! Kings game loss was atrocious
JustinTimeHeHe::LEMONADE!!! GET YOUR LEMONADE!! FRESHLY SQUEEZED!!!   (From a Far)- "This tastes Like $@%!!!"
ChrisHall SMD::WTF?
ChrisHall SMD::Give it up for Curry tho
chris johnson 558::and then the warriors said that they are not the lakers lol
ChrisHall SMD::Wh likes their on comments? LOL
ChiGuy1002::Dude- liking your own comment is pathetic.
ChiGuy1002::That's my boy, Glen Davis... fantasy stud... BAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
trizzo23::great game...on a back to back ..... go magic !!
WarriorsWarrior::Yup gl
Clipper Fan Since the Jazz Flop::WOOT GO ORLANDO
vmcmillan2::jj=harden last year
MagicBoltzRays::This was a nice victory, but nothing is going to top last night.
jumpy785::u still need catching up to heats
99 Bottles of Beer::Well, that won't happen for awhile, so not worried about that now
chris johnson 558::like if you proud to be a magic fan
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::oaklandfan8891 magic fans loved dwight, then the second he leaves, he becomes a enemy? ----------------------------------------------------------- Same thing happens with every fanbase in every sport.  Look how all of a sudden the SF Giants fans have turned on Brian Wilson
WarriorsWarrior::agreed. I think its For tinseltown reasons
WarriorsWarrior::Of course HE WANTS 2 be a Dodger?
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::He never said explicitly he wanted to be a dodger.  He said he'd consider it because he feels slighted by the front office.  Not justifying it, im simply pointing out that 2010 means nothing anymore
oaklandfan8891::yes, i agree with that statement
JustinTimeHeHe::I have my own business.. just opened up my own Lemonade stand on the corner of East-Lenox and 45th. It's in the ghetto but it's some really good Lemonade so stop by, we're bring a cup right to your car, you dont even hafto get out. $3.50 for a small.
HiTekk_::Very impressive, good sir
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::that sounds like one heck of a deal... If im ever in your corner of the projects, i'll have to give you a try
HiTekk_::so youre a business man?
JustinTimeHeHe::Well, yes. I didnt go to school or anything but I own my own lemonade stand
