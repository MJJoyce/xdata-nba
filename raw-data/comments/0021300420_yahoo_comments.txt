Guck The Fiants::All I see is morons below me who know nothing about basketball just pathetic.
Larry::Heat are shooting layups and  Lakers are taking 3's. D'Antoni is a JOKE- always has been - got  little lucky on Phoenix since players were suited for high-scoring shootouts- but it is not like he won an NBA championship. And the nerve of him telling Lakers fans to change the team they root for is they don;t like the way the team is playing now. Man up and just quit- you cannot coach NBA basketball and , even though the team is lousy, you make it even worse. Even a HS coach, knows how to teach how to switch men when you are picked- but you don;t.
Guck The Fiants::Attention hater trolls Bite me.
wt::Merry, Merry Christmas! To hoop fans all over the world From #1,  The Arizona Wildcats.
poorpple::Looks like Bosh has just figured out that he is playing center, not shooting guard.  It's the same ritual over and over gain for each game.
Hair Club Dooley::I wonder why everyone is laughing so hard everytime they see me today here at work? I hope I don't have another kick me sign on my back? They are all suck kidders.
Hair Club Dooley::Is today the 24th of Neveraury? This is when my company Christmas party is on my card & I want to go boogie down and disco. I hope Santa Clause Lane Blvd is close by?
Anne::Larry, please stop posting in the NBA section. You really don't know a damn thing about basketball. Just go away!
Yippy Yi Yah::What other sport besides football is gonna show 5 games on a major holiday on National TV?  Talk about major league NBA revenue that these players got screwed out of during the c b a contract talks.
Hair Club Dooley::I wonder why everyone is laughing so hard everytime they see me today here at work? I hope I don't have another kick me sign on my back? They are all such kidders.
