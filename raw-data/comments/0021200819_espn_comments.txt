joest2003::Anyone see how lamb did i know he only got a few minutes
PINKYCUZ-OKC::he looked high but hit a 3.
Boomtown405::He always does lol
012garrett::when does brewer get to play
Westjag::I think he'll be available Sunday. Scott Brooks is going to put him in film session today at practice.
BigVicTIA::Good game and OKC are the best in the west. F**k off haters. Westbrook 37 points, 7 rebounds and 9 assist. Legend.
AaronBrack::Why did the Cleveland steamer get more time then Pek?
MinniWolves90::He was beasting and Pek was slacking.
nba is the worst::Nice to see Westbrook shoot over 50% AND get 9 ast.  The "tough" OKC schedule continues...
wunderrr::100% on 22FT, good job OKC. 17 from KD and Westbrook, they obviously trained that :)
Brickyyy Rubio::so how is bricky holding up
Brickyyy Rubio::trade rubio for a taco
Laker Fan 47::Just want to make sure that everybody understands that the Lakers are yours and my 2012-2013 NBA Champions.
Brickyyy Rubio::dont they have to make the playoffs first which isnt going to happen
Brighton And Hove Albion::I CANNOT believe Derrick Williams is a career .411% shooter. This must be a typo cause he aint that good!
death of 1000 monks::Westbrook has been playing better than Durant recently.

PantherPower89::That's right $@%! you westbrook haters! ThunderUp!
Rolltide4203::who does? Westbrook is one of the top few players in the league easy.
NDFRockets18::Still blows over half the time
uw2100::Just stopped by to check the boxscore,  Greg Stiemsma 9 minutes goes 	4-5	shooting	5-6 on FT	13 points   6 rebounds	4 blocks	  That is a good 9 minutes of work. Is it right??
AaronBrack::no, he had 26 minutes.
Brickyyy Rubio::who was guarding wstbrook????
Qzhoopin20::Blowout win for OKC...Westbrook goes for 37 &amp; 9, on 59% FG shooting....but Skip Bayless will condemn him (like always) for taking more shots than Durant tonight!
The Random Dude35::Skip is a joke
jaguars7282::people still watch first take?
jank6708::Victor Oladipo is shooting .639% and .511% 3-pt he sure would be a nice addition to the Wolves
remy 88::Everybody's eyeballing the same three guys in the draft. Muhammad, Oladipo and McLemore.
Mittens___the cat::next year the wolves should really think of getting shooters, cut luke and JJ, heck i wouldn't even mind if we got Jimmer, at least the dude can shoot.
Mittens___the cat::I just fought about this, but the Wolves should go after Fridzon-shved's and Ak's Russian teammate, dude was a killer shooter in the Olympics.
jank6708::I don't mind Luke off the bench but JJ is TO City baby
MNkittenmittens::RIP broy's knees
Mittens___the cat::Do the thunder have any fans? I see only see Wolves fans on this board.
Matthew Borba::Because you can only count the fans that show up on an ESPN board, and not the 19,000 that pack Chesapeake Arena for Thunder games..
remy 88::they're over on the spurs boards, I bet
Mittens___the cat::shut up meg:)
remy 88::somethin's wrong with you, bro
Mittens___the cat::shut up meg
MNkittenmittens::bandwagon.
Minnysota Vikings::Is it legal to trade a coach in a trade?
remy 88::HA! I've actually read we should trade Scotty B for the Adel-minded in the last week.
Mittens___the cat::shut up meg
remy 88::something wrong with you, bro
Mittens___the cat::shut up meg
Mittens___the cat::I don't want the first overall pick as a Wolves fan, with our bad luck any player khan drafts will be a bust even if they would be a superstar on the other 29 NBA teams.
jank6708::Would be nice for the Wolves to go 15-15 the rest of the way for 35 wins
Not Not A Wolves Fan::how's about 30-0?
Mittens___the cat::don't worry bro, we going undefeated rest of the way.
MNkittenmittens::nah, what's the point?
MNkittenmittens::show me a good draft pick instead.
jank6708::show some improvement
012garrett::IM SORRY IF I HURT YOU OR BAD MOUTHED ANY WOLVES FAN OR NOT FANS I DIDNT MEAN TO BE MEN I PROMISE IM A NICE PERSON...more
012garrett::WELL SEE YOU GUYS NEXT GAME HAVE A GOOD NIGHT
Not Not A Wolves Fan::push caps lock and all is forgiven
MNkittenmittens::k
YogaBeer::Westbrook!    WoW what a game.
brandonstephensy::lets tweet #freejjbarea
MNkittenmittens::as long as minnesota holds the coke, he's not going anywhere
Jacks_Link::I'm out. You MN fans are always classy. Good luck the rest of the season.
Not Not A Wolves Fan::gg
remy 88::Wolves fans- sell me your ball club next year. Is everyone just waiting for K Love to come back or what?
Mittens___the cat::Fu#$ off Remy, I see you one more time hating on the Wolves, I'll come through your computer screen and slap the living @#@# out of you.:)
Mittens___the cat::Remy i swear to god im going to slap you right now.
remy 88::Simmer down, Mittens. I don't hate Wolves fans. Trust me. You guys aren't competitive enough for me to care. I'd like to see you guys compete, I was asking an honest question.
Minnysota Vikings::Wolves main problems right now 1.) Not enough scoring and rebounding from the PF position 2.) Terrible 3 point shooting 3.) No athletic wings  Love obviously covers the first 2. Chase Budinger is tall and very athletic. Basically what I'm saying is the Wolves biggest weaknesses are covered by our 2 players that are out.
Minnysota Vikings::MNkittenmittens - as long as he lays of the mas.turbation and lets his hand heal properly, we should be good.  You really think he has that type of self control?
Mittens___the cat::health is all this team needs to compete.
MNkittenmittens::as long as he lays of the mas.turbation and lets his hand heal properly, we should be good.
MNkittenmittens::not really. it's not like he'll turn this team around this season.  just hoping we tank it now. he needs to get in better shape too
remy 88::I ask because I don't understand. NO is terrible. Phoenix also, but I understand where they're going. I don't get Minny at all.
remy 88::well, what are we building around? how's our salary/trade/pick situation look?
Mittens___the cat::Wolves fans our next game is against Golden State, what do you expect the results to be?
Mittens___the cat::I say we win this, lets hope the whole warriors team gets sick.
Minnysota Vikings::"Pain."  --Pekovic
MNkittenmittens::147-145 warrriors
MNkittenmittens::now that the wolves' playoff hopes are dashed, my only hope for this season is for the lakers to finish well under .500
Not Not A Wolves Fan::you forgot #1 pick and finally landing a franchise sg
Not Not A Wolves Fan::can you imagine that? rubes, McLemore, Ak, Love, Pek
MNkittenmittens::lol the twolves franchise?
Mittens___the cat::naw i would like the Lakers to finish below .400
remy 88::Thabo continues to impress.
Jacks_Link::Let's go Golden State!
Mittens___the cat::NO
MNkittenmittens::and portland
Jacks_Link::Wouldn't it be funny if they lost a game the same night they guaranteed making the playoffs?
MNkittenmittens::i miss wally!!!
012garrett::NOT NOT A WOLVES FAN IS MY BEST FRIEND THOUGHT I WOULD LET YOU KNOW HE SAID HE WISHED A BULLET WOULD GO THROUGH MY HEAD WOW HE SUCH A NICE GUY
012garrett::IM SORRY IF I HURT YOU OR BAD MOUTHED ANY WOLVES FAN OR NOT FANS I DIDNT MEAN TO BE MEN I PROMISE IM A NICE PERSON
012garrett::WELL WHEN DENVER BEAT US BY ALITTLE ONLY ABOUT 2-3 THREE GAMES AFTER WE ABSOLUTLY CRUSHED THEM AT OUR PLACE ALL THEY DID IS TALK TRASH SAYING KD IS HORRIBLE THUNDER IS THE WORST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE  RUSSELL IS HORRIBLE SYAING THEIR PLAYERS WERE BETTER THEN KD
012garrett::I REALLY DONT SEE WHY YOU DONT LIKE ME IVE SAID NOTHING BAD UNLIKE WHAT ALOT OF OTHER THUNDER FANS ARE POSTING BUT TOMORROW IF I GET SHOT IN THE HEAD IM HUANTING ALL OF YOU JK LOL ILL BE YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL I LIKE WOLVES FAN A WHOLE LOT MORE THEN DENVER FANS
MNkittenmittens::speak up
MNkittenmittens::nope. that was "WOLVES ARE A JOKE OF A TEAM"
Not Not A Wolves Fan::THE PACK IS HOWLIN NOW
Not Not A Wolves Fan::actually that was "my wolves lack talent"  i agree with him now though
Minnysota Vikings::Dude, that wasn't him. It was the "Wolves are Talentless" guy.
Not Not A Wolves Fan::yeah i said garrett hates bewbs
remy 88::Russ's locker room interviews are a scream. LOL
remy 88::he's awful but that's what makes them good.
Mittens___the cat::Why do people talk shyytt about the Wolves when damn well they know we are missing our best player in K Love and our second best scorer Bud. For god sake's the Wolves are missing 40 points a game, Where would other teams be just alone without their best player?
remy 88::because no one takes K-Love seriously either
jank6708::Pek is 2nd best scorer
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Depends what team. Some would be toast, some would be fine.
Roll Tide-OKC-Heat::After this game, is there any doubt who the best player in the NBA is?
Minnysota Vikings::Lebron is #1 and Durant is #2. After those two, there's a considerable drop off.
crooked ernie::Kobe has to be 3, i think he is a dou.ch.e but he is awesome.  I think after kobe there is a severe dropoff.
Not Not A Wolves Fan::steamer
goldengophs91::Nope, it's definitely Lebron
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::What does Minny plan to do to keep Pekovic?
Minnysota Vikings::They say he'll get somewhere between 10-12 million a season. However he seems like he'll take a home discount to stay in Minny. He's becoming a big ice fishing fan lol
Minnysota Vikings::They'll have to. Absolutely cannot let him go. Wolves worst games this year were when he didn't play.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Will they go up to $64 million to keep him?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::How does Minny offer him $10 million? They have $54 million on the books for next year already.
Minnysota Vikings::If Minny offers 10 a year and another team offers 12, I think he'll take the 10 and stay.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::How much of a pay cut is ice fishing worth?
Mittens___the cat::cause he's good, just one bad game, other times we face the thunder he scores over 20.
Mittens___the cat::my bad im doing something else right now, i miss read what for why.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::You obviously didn't read the question. Try again.
BigVicTIA::Russell Westbrook and KD is the best duo in the NBA since Kobe and Shaq. Spurs-Thunder will be the real NBA Finals.
012garrett::AND MIAMI HAVE NOT CRUSHED US BUD
goldengophs91::Do you mean Spurs or Thunder? Or, did the Spurs suddenly move to the Eastern conference
sooner1980wb20::No he is bascially saying the winner of the Spurs Thunder will be a shoe-in to beat the East... which is ridiculous.
012garrett::THAT COULD NOT HAPPEN THUNDER AND SPURS ARE ON THE SAME SIDE
sooner1980wb20::LOL^^^^
BigVicTIA::The Heat sucks as well as the Eastern Conference
sooner1980wb20::Yeah well they have beat the $H!T out of us the last 6 games we played em, so...
sooner1980wb20::lets not get carried away... the Heat are no joke
jank6708::K-Love please come back soon so we can see what would have been a playoff team
MY WOLVES ARE TALENTLESS::love has no talent I guess.
remy 88::Not trying to troll, but I wouldn't believe in that guy, man. Constantly fat or injured. He's not a ballplayer.
012garrett::KD ALL DAY WHAT MAKES ME MAD WHEN LEBRON WHENT LIKE 5 GAMES OVER 30 POINTS EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT BUT WHEN KD WHEN LIKE 7 GAMES OVER 30 AND TWO OVER THEM HE SCORED 46, AND 50 NOBODY TALKED ABOUT IT MAKES ME MAD ...more User ID:http://sportsnation.espn.go.com/fans/012garrett
012garrett::NOT ALWAYS
Not Not A Wolves Fan::bewbies are gross  -012garrett
FadeBackShootAirBall2::damn westbrook was ballin out tonight
Mittens___the cat::If only we had K-Love and Bud healthy for the season we would be in the playoff hunt.
MNkittenmittens::"if's" are the story of minnesota sports
tkidu::"I have a family to feed ... If Glen Taylor wants to see my family fed, he better cough up some money. Otherwise, you're going to see these kids in one of those Sally Struthers commercials soon."
Jacks_Link::Tonight is the start of our winning stretch. Chicago is going to get destroyed on Sunday.
tkidu::flip is going to the gophers. we don't need em
Reedh2332::tubby is a $@%!$@ coach. he has never been able to recruit talent. he inherited his Kentucky team.
goldengophs91::I would love that or for them to Shaka things up and get Smart. See what I did there?
MNkittenmittens::but tubby's a beast
brandonstephensy::Guys - Lamb+PJ3+TOr 1st round pick for a top three pick in 2013 Draft? your thoughts?
Jacks_Link::Did MN lead at any point during the game?
012garrett::NOPE
MNkittenmittens::we jumped out to an early 23-4 lead.
Jacks_Link::I must have been in the bathroom.
AmazinGrapeOKC::no
Jacks_Link::I didn't think so. Thanks.
Minnysota Vikings::Bring back Flip Saunders and Trenton Hassell.
MNkittenmittens::spreeeeeeeeeeeewell
Minnysota Vikings::Funny how he said 8 million couldn't feed his family, but retiring and being unemployed would.
Ricky Rubio9::Just imagine If OKC signed pek in FA. They would be incredible
brandonstephensy::There's no reason DeAndre Liggins should get more minutes than Jeremy Lamb.
remy 88::I actually think they're doing a good job with our young guys. I might be in the minority
012garrett::WHY YOU SAY THAT DID YOU WATCH THE GAME WHERE LIGGINS STARTED HE HAD A AMAZING GAME HE IS AN AMAZING DEFENDER
sooner1980wb20::amazing defender????  lets not get carried away
