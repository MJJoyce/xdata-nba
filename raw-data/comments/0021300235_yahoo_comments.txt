BDubz::73 free throws does not make for an entertaining game especially when one player can get 4 fouls over a 6 minutes for just defending the basket.
Princess Luna::What an amazing so far! Now if only there were less whistles, then I would like it even more.
chuck d::Adams needs to play more ; only way to really learn NBA game.Get him experience now in regular season  and it will pay off latter. Also Perkins is and has always been a stiff, he got no game at all.
AlD::Is there a specific reason why the refs and the NBA always give OKC 10-15 more FT attempts than there opponents?
Young 2e::Some Very Very Questionable Refereeing going on in the last minutes of the game I swear every possession in the final 3 mins that OKC got was a foul or a made shot which was very few and far between... NBA has to do something to make it more fair no way a team that out shoots you from the floor by 6-7 shots from the field should even be close
TR3S::It's hard to win not making free throws, It's impossible to beat the referees.  What a joke with those rigged calls
Vycka::Just never meant to be Warriors win. Ibaka deflects the ball - refs give the ball back to Thunder. ONeal secures rebount - Westbrook goes over him and knocks the ball back to thunder. On the other end Warrior sneezes and Thunder shoots free throws.
glicious::Thunder play an "exciting" brand of basketball. except every game i watch them play its either a free throw fest thanks to the referees handing phantom fouls out to westbrook and durant like theyre handing out hallowing candy, and when the thunder arent getting calls its them crying to the refs all game long.  Screw that team. They didn't deserve to win this game.  They will never win a title.
JC::In the end, the missed FT's killed the W's
PatN::Giving 15 FT shots for Westbrook (81% career) and 12 for Durant (83% career) can cost you in the long run. Great game by both teams.
