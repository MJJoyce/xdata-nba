CNets1589::The whole Nets team didn't play so good on da defense and Keith Bogans...sigh..
its enrico pallazo::When the 4 way howard/bynum/iggy trade was made it seemed as if orlando got the worst of the deal. Turns out philly traded their best player for nothing. Bynum will never play a single game as a 76er.
Tom8045::Ive been following a betting system called SportsBettingStar a few months back.  Since I started playing this system, Ive doubled my earnings in just 60 days using it.  You can find this system on the first page of Google by looking up Sports Betting Systems.  I recommend this system to anyone that likes to bet on sports like I do.

RicoRed222::n id like to see lebron here, but it wont happen!! Unless we trade bynum for em! lol
romeo8880::The Nets will absolutely lose in the first round of the playoffs.  Bunch of scrubs.
RZA_CONSOLE::i thought latrell already stated that carlisimo sucks
RZA_CONSOLE::whaaaaat?
arizonasting13::HAMED HADDADI IS BREAKING OUT IN FRONT OF OUR VERY EYES
LBJ and KD GOAT::No more luck left for nets coach
Illinifan2192::Well at least D-Will is playing well.
YinBallaz::You look at Blo, Joe, and dwill stats...and you assume it must be an easy victory. Nope, no offense down certain stretches, and no defense.
imissibanez::thad healthy,and they mustve told spence hes plan b,
RNYC_125::Sixers?!  Nets suck. True second fiddle NY team
knicks_112ndcoming::i cannot possibly believe how much hype. their owner, GM , barkley and even the players themselves said b4 season even started . they were dogging us. yet we didnt make a statement on it and  hoped for the best. Look at us now.
gt1master_ike::We gave him flak when he was sucking it up. Its only fair to give him props. Deron Williams has been balling since the all star break. Crash needs to wake the fk up now.
Manuel5889::The only way that I could find an explanation for this game today is vegas.  How in the world could the Nets lose to the worse team in the league right now besides the Wolves.  Last night they lost to Orlando that is pathetic today they beat the NETS.  THe NETS beat the Hawks by about 10 and today play like $@%!.   NBA is all about set up.
Dribbird.::Sixers are just the better team
imissibanez::best answer yet
Heat Fan since the Lebron draft::Nets gave Wallace that contract for no reason. Did you guys think he was gonna play like Lebron or something?
Heat Fan since the Lebron draft::LOL @ the rebounding. Hmmm I wonder who on the roster can give you guys some extra rebounding...
88bryant18::Who loses to the Sixers???
Everyday im Shufflin 290::NO SLEEP TIL BROOKLYN
knicks_112ndcoming::CROOK_LYN
BigPhilly517::I guess this is the Sixers way of helping us out after they blew us out in late January.... Thanks Spencer Hawes.
Chrisp722_NY2::BROOOKLLLYYYNNN
DavidA11429::<b> NETS JUNK </b>
knicks_112ndcoming::BAHGAGAGAGA  HAHHA
KnicksForReal003::YOU MODS ARE A FUKN JOKE.  BIITCH $@% MOFO
KnicksForReal003::LEARCH.. AKA LOPEZ   TRAVELS EVERY TIME ..  BIG DOOFY MOFO..
phillyman08::When the 2nd worse offensive team scores 106 on your team, you know they sucked lol
KnicksForReal003::NIGG@S BE SWEATING LEBRON..   FAKE A SS HEAT FANS.
BangBangNC::DWill is starting to go off...after that 42 pt game
BangBangNC::he just got his game to another level
Mets2410::even before then he was playing really well
KnicksForReal003::Thanks Sixers.    My Knicks are going to have a Though Road ahead of them.    lIttle breathing room tonight.
karelp::Hawes dominates Lopez...lol
KnicksForReal003::Where's Brooklyn At?  lmaoooo
KingJames6Swag::If anything my teams the nets and I would want nothing more for them to beat the heat. Unfortunately lebron is the best player in the league and really fun to watch play
KnicksForReal003::U FRUIT CAKE.
KingJames6Swag::His $@%!$ huge hop on with me =)
KingJames6Swag::Where's Amare at?
KnicksForReal003::Get off Lebrons DICK.. ROOT FOR A TEAM NOT A PLAYER FOOL.. WHERE'S YOUR ALLIANCE...
KnicksForReal003::$@%!$, you no nets FAn.. stf u
ktan88::Who ever said Amare wasn't contributing, obviously haven't seen him play. He was averaging 13+ pts on 60% shooting in 20 mins. In starting minutes he might average 26+.
thekola::what they meant was that he doesn't contribute because he is injured all the time
philweilert::Why doesn't the Nets send Tyshawn down to the D-League so that he get playing time
potato623::Thank god the raptors won last night  Go Detroit and Phoenix
jsl03::The tank moves one tread at a time.
djny2k12::For every rebound Reggie grabs....he hurts his team on the offense. Can't catch a ball to save his life....Reggie should not be starting! When is Blatche and Lopez going to play together???
steve pionke::Blatche, Lopez and Wallace together grab 10 boards and defend nobody.  Nets get destroyed w/that starting lineup.  Wallace isn't producing anything, he's a bigger problem than Evans,
NewcastleFanVL::Whose contract is worse, Amare's or Joe johnson's ?
Constantinius III::It's actually Amare's, despite his recent efficiency, simply because he's out so often. (That's why I believe that Derrick Rose has seriously underperformed the super-max extension he got already.  All the potential in the world gets the Bulls nowhere if he's never on the floor and constantly injured.) Despite Joe Johnson's LOL-worthy contract, he is still a pretty consistent contributor who will give you the requisite 15 to 20 PPG.  But of course he's not a max guy; the problem with his contract is they gave him max dollars over max years when he's on the declining side of his career.  Joe should be earning something like $45 million over 4; in a rational world, teams would probably still overpay, and give him something like $65 million over 5.
grepilgr::Out of all the pg playing in the NBA Rose deserved that contract. Boozer is the one thats overpaid, Bulls would be in the 1st seed if Rose wasn't injured and he's only injured because he has to do everything himself sometimes and that leaves to much stress on his body.
BigPhilly517::Johnson.... He has an extra year and $25 more million than Amar'e.
Mets2410::easily Amare. At least Joe is still one of the best players at his position.
KingJames6Swag::amare..the guys injured again
Everyday im Shufflin 290::Johnson's
Fredhowwwy::Amare, he isn't even contributing
kneegrowplease123::yea knee growS!
