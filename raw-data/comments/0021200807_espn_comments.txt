twphyzx::C's fans... LOL.
lbkking::HOUSTON CONTINUES THE INSANITY    *PAID WAY TOOO MUCH FOR LIN.  * KNOWINGLY WASTE A 1st RND PICK ON THE MENTALLY ILL , ROYCE WHITE ???  *SIGN HARDEN- BAD GAMBLE THAT WORKED OUT.  * NOW THEY TRADE 3O ppg &amp; 11 rebs FOR 10 ppg &amp; 6 rebs    I GUESS THE LAKERS WILL MAKE THE PLAYOFFS
scottpilgrim30::For those that say the refs had no part in last nights laker win is a joke.  It was 12-2 fta favoring the Lakers at the end of the 1st which paved the way for the rest of the game. The Cetlics were actually pretty even the rest of the way
chocolate giddyup::If they called all the moving screens the celts set, they would have to forfeit the majority of their games because they'd run out of players.
zZSmOkIn-KuShZz::Look at the points in the paint 54 for lakers 30 for boston...the team that goes hard in the paint the most is definitely going to get Fouled a lot
chocolate giddyup::Paul Pierce eating 4 Fatburgers at halftime also had alot to do with it. 3pts in the 2nd half.
jrosborough08::The Lakers road to the playoffs is real tough.  Golden State, Utah, and Houston have to help out big time.  Utah and Houston have bad road records, but Utah has a tough road coming up.  Golden State had some problems earlier but may have rebounded.  Houston has an easy schedule for the remainder of the season.  So sorry Lakers!
chocolate giddyup::lakers have 1 win vs the top 4 seeds in the west. squeaking into a bottom seed won't mean a whole lot.
chocolate giddyup::You allow offensive rebounds when your bigs are scrambling trying to cover that guy who just blew by your perimeter defense. And you don't create turnovers because your perimeter defenders don't/can't pressure the ball. Alot of the Laker woes are because of their perimeter D. It ain't all about 3 pointers.
jcmaggi::The Lakers' perimeter defense isn't the problem (they're 6th in points per shot allowed). It's allowing offensive rebounds and turning the ball over (without creating more of their own)
chocolate giddyup::With the way the lakers play perimeter defense? hell yes!!
jcmaggi::You're right, even if they make the playoffs, Lakers would have to overcome some very big odds to do anything. However, if you're the Spurs, do you want to face Howard, Kobe, Pau, Nash and MWP in round 1?
scottpilgrim30::"We paid tribute to JB by helping the Lakers win last night. you know... for old time sake"  Refs from last night
IBleedGarnetandGold15::You're a loser.  -The world
Dane Kitazaki::he wants to play for miami 1st choice
PP owns Rondo::6 fouls are gone from Collins. He's not that good but he is a big man that relieves KG from time to time. I hope Danny gets a legit big to help KG.
jcmaggi::Jeff Green for Kendrick Perkins is really hurting the franchise.
jcmaggi::well, if his mentality is "we have to beat the heat" then he's not wrong
PP owns Rondo::Yep. I guess Danny is banking on not having to face an elite center in the playoffs.
scottpilgrim30::The way the refs played last night you knew they weren't gonna let the Lakers lose
jrosborough08::The way Dwight played last night you knew he wasn't gonna let the Lakers lose!
Dane Kitazaki::The way KG looked on the bench at the all-star game, retirement is on his mind
PP owns Rondo::Danny must be getting K-Mart and some other big off the scrap heap or from a buy-out. He has to or KG will have no other bigs to relieve him in the playoffs.
jcmaggi::For me the exciting thing about the trade deadline is the buy outs. Although judging from the lack of movement, there won't be many buy outs.
PP owns Rondo::I agree. I hope Danny has something up his sleeve. He better.
jcmaggi::The reason the Lakers make sense is not just for the immediate money, but for the long term money as well. Say for example, Dwight goes to Dallas on a 4 year deal. He'll be 31 by the end of that contract. You think Cuban is going to want to invest in to another max deal with Howard at that age? No. Most small market franchises don't have that luxury. LA on the other hand would. Why? Because of their $3 billion 20 year TV deal.   It's not just that the Lakers would be able to offer Dwight that extra year and $30 million, but also that the Lakers are the team that can most afford to over pay you once you start to decline. They did it with Shaq. They are doing it with Kobe. They will do it with Dwight.
chocolate giddyup::It all depends on what Dwight wants. If it was just the money, he could have stayed in ORL and avoided all this mess in the first place. So obviously, it's more than just the money. If he wants to be with a better roster, HOU &amp; ATL have better pieces than the Lakers right now. If it's endorsements, he can get that anywhere. I see Durant in way more ads than Carmelo.
Jrinc242.0::They can also afford to provide a roster that will compete for a championship every year
jrosborough08::Dwight's stock went so far down. But he showed last night what he's capable of, even not at 100%.  He's just too wishy-washy!!
jcmaggi::Correct. They can provide all the wonderful things that come with being able to ridiculously outspend everyone and STILL turn a significant profit.
jrosborough08::You never know with Dwight and his people.   The money may not be what he wants. He may not know what he wants.  The Lakers can offer big money over 5, but not 4 years
jcmaggi::They can offer him the most money. Period. I agree with you, he may be looking for more than money. But if it's titles, then he needs to stay in LA too.
jcmaggi::Not to mention the additional endorsement money he would make for being in LA.
jrosborough08::Rondo deal for Josh Smith would have been nice for both teams, especially since Ainge is hell bent on letting Rondo go!!!
chocolate giddyup::They don't want rondo when they already have teague at pg.
Jrinc242.0::If Brousard says it you know its fake
jrosborough08::Chris Brussard said Rondo for Dwight earlier.  But Atlanta and Boston would have been helped in a Rondo-Smith trade!!
jrosborough08::So far, there have been no big trades before the deadline; just a bunch of tweaks here and there!!
jrosborough08::Because of the Time Warner deal the Lakers can offer Dwight big money over 5 years, BUT will he stay and deal with the tough love of Kobe???
PP owns Rondo::Danny is dumb. He traded away Collins (big man) and Barbosa for Jordan Crawford. KG will have no help on the frontlines in the playoffs. KG will have no one to relieve him when he needs a breather. Dumb trade.
chocolate giddyup::Celts on pace for another 2 1/2 decades of futility.
Return of Mystik-eye::Danny needs to take up smoking Reds old cigars.Then maybe he can put a great dynasty together
Dane Kitazaki::I dunno if Danny is thinking about this season anymore.
jcmaggi::Ya seriously, he has to play too much 5 as it is.
jrosborough08::This season may be much  ado about nothing.  We don't solve much with a sign and trade for Dwight, and we may get mostly money for him; nothing else.  We lost our 1st picks for 13' and 15', so it's do or die with Nash for this year and/or next.
jcmaggi::IF the Lakers put a 5 year $118 million deal in front of Dwight this summer, I doubt he goes anywhere.
chocolate giddyup::Big market doesn't mean what it used to when it comes to endorsements. Lebron already proved that in Cleveland. And I see Durant in more ads than anybody.
chocolate giddyup::If he won 5 rings there then of course he would.
Jrinc242.0::You have named two.  But do you think Kobe would have deals in Turkey or China to name a few if he played for the Pacers or Bucks?
PP owns Rondo::I agree with this.
Jrinc242.0::He will stay.  More money longer contract and in Hollywood
chocolate giddyup::it's going to take more than money to make him stay. the extra year isn't that crucial to a guy his age
chocolate giddyup::teams are still fighting to sign greg oden roy hibbert got a max deal a big man will always get paid
jcmaggi::31 year old center is not in his prime. He won't get $30 million a year when he's 31.
chocolate giddyup::The bulk of the 30 mill is because of the extra year. If he goes elsewhere for 4 years, you really think he isn't gonna get another max deal after that? Plus, the parameters will probably be higher by then. The extra year isn't as important as folks think...especially when you're in your prime.
jcmaggi::Really? $30 million a year isn't crucial to a 31 year old?
Jrinc242.0::the 30 million and the off court money is
Robert Sacre::I did not get traded! Laker fans can breathe a sigh of relief now
zZSmOkIn-KuShZz::Best cheerleader ever
Jrinc242.0::Man how could the lakers get equal value for you?  you are the best three point celebrator in the league!
Jrinc242.0::Well summer 2013 just got intersting.  Josh Smith, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul all good friends and all free agents
Return of Mystik-eye::CP and Dwight aint going nowhere.
Jrinc242.0::chocolate giddyup - with what team? nobody has Heat-like cap space  The Lakers could the Mavs could.  If people think that teams are scared of the tax David has another thing coming
Jrinc242.0::Its still not the Lakers and its still Donald Sterling.  They are going to lose in the second round again this year to okc as well
Dane Kitazaki::Dane Kitazaki - I wouldnt doubt he goes to the Knicks (CP3). Melo is his best friend. They would amnesty Amare in a heart beat  Just remembered, they used their amnesty.  So the Knicks is out lol
Dane Kitazaki::I wouldnt doubt he goes to the Knicks (CP3).  Melo is his best friend.  They would amnesty Amare in a heart beat
Return of Mystik-eye::I hear ya but no way CP gives up on the clips He is the man of the moment in LA right now.Thats a lot of fame and $$$$
chocolate giddyup::with what team? nobody has Heat-like cap space
Jrinc242.0::I wouldnt put it past them to make their own super team.  The young guys nowadays have no loyalties

Return of Mystik-eye::History.The Lakes have always had good luck with big men in trades,Wilt,Kareem,Shaq.This season too many injuries but we'll see next season for sure if it starts to gel.
Dane Kitazaki::Is he gonna be around for next season?  Doesnt he need to sign yet?
jcmaggi::I dunno if he's mentally capable of handling it. I think that's what Kobe's been trying to do, more than just pi$$ him off, I think Kobe is trying to groom Dwight for the kind of expectations that comes with being the star of the Lakers. On one hand, you get everything you want. You will be revered. You will be beloved. LA will literally be his city. The flip side is that he's expected to bring it every night, rain or shine, injury or not.   A lot of guys can't handle those expectations.
Dane Kitazaki::Dwight is a secondary player at best.  If he's the best option on the team, they wont win
chocolate giddyup::when's the last time a meaningful deal was made at the deadline? Sheed to the Pistons is the only one that comes to mind. these guys on NBATV look like idiots sitting there waiting to break the "big" news
Dane Kitazaki::they getting paid
zZSmOkIn-KuShZz::Come on lakers trade Dwight for Smith
Jrinc242.0::not happening
jcmaggi::ummmm......give me some of what you're smokin please
zZSmOkIn-KuShZz::$@%! no get your own $@%!
Jrinc242.0::no way reddick stays.  shoot i wouldnt even report...
Jrinc242.0::They havent been relevant since Kareem left in the 70's
jcmaggi::seriously, Milwaukee? wtf
chocolate giddyup::probably time to stop saying that the celts are better without rondo...
PP owns Rondo::Why? He's a selfish assist player. Lol
chocolate giddyup::look at the record the past few games
PP owns Rondo::Josh Smith to the Bucks. LMAO!!! Smith will have no chance to win a title there.
Jrinc242.0::Hes a rental bro.  No way he signs an extension there
Jrinc242.0::So the Bucks got a rental in Josh Smith supposedly
Corvo Attano::5-15 kobe last night.  another brick fest
jcmaggi::The day the NBA starts giving out rings because of shooting efficiency, I'll start to really care about it.
zZSmOkIn-KuShZz::Who gives a $@%!
PP owns Rondo::Well, I guess Danny isn't a snake. PP netter retire after this year though if he wants to retire a Celtic, b/c I think Danny will trade him next year. PP would only have 1 year left on his contract after this year.
chocolate giddyup::never should have given him that extension
PP owns Rondo::Shut up Nebula.
Dane Kitazaki::how do you not?
Corvo Attano::lakers are undefeated since the season started

jcmaggi::uh oh, watch out, OKC just traded Eric Maynor to the Blazers.....BOOM
PP owns Rondo::Kobe is a beast. I think he would've won probably 3 rings in his career without Shaq. That's how much respect I have for him. He probably would've have won 5 straight rings with Shaq though as well.
Bill GOAT potus::He did win 2 witout him, and there is still a chance he could get one more...but that window is closing fast.
PP owns Rondo::Kobe won't win another ring. Lakers aren't going to the playoffs this year.
jcmaggi::Of course not, to win that many rings, you have to be blessed with a great situation. Don't forget, MJ had Scottie, PJ, and Rodman not to mention the NBA was down in the mid 90's.....I'm not taking anything away from MJ, but maybe if he played in todays league, he might have only gotten 2-4 rings with those teams.  Just like if Kobe hadn't played with Shaq, maybe the Lakers win 1 or 2 titles with Shaq. To dominate, you need the perfect set of circumstances. Lakers had that in the early 00's.  And unlike most guys that won a lot with the same team, Kobe has shown he can do it with different casts.
JORDANisGOAT1A-KOBEisGOAT1B::GOT,THAT,KOBE,SWAG
JORDANisGOAT1A-KOBEisGOAT1B::WE,ON,THAT,SQUIRMY,TRAIN
jcmaggi::So because Shaq was the MVP, Kobe was a role player along for the ride? That's like saying Tony Parker was just a role player along for the ride when TD won MVP twice during their finals together.
JORDANisGOAT1A-KOBEisGOAT1B::YOU,ARE,THE,ONE,WHO,LACKS,PERSPECTIVE....FARKWAD
JORDANisGOAT1A-KOBEisGOAT1B::THIS,ISNT,A,STUPID,COMEDY,MOVIE...THIS,IS,REAL,LIFE,MORON...BUT,NICE,TRY,AT,A,FAILED,ANALOGY...LMAO

Bill GOAT potus::John - 13417 Elvin - 13296 Kobe - 13024  Why wont the media pay homage to this all-time acomplishment? It just a matter of time before Kobe is the King.

Jrinc242.0::So do you think Brett Farve sucked too?
Bill GOAT potus::I never offically said Kobe sucks...he just needs to be used effectivley, and should have listened to Phil more.
Jrinc242.0::touche
Bill GOAT potus::Kind of. He did blow more than one game in his day. Take the sack and maybe he would get it done the next snap.
Dane Kitazaki::at text messaging he does
Dane Kitazaki::what is that? missed shots?
Bill GOAT potus::Bricks
Worldwide Leader in Sports::trade deadline looming. ESPN breaks in with routine chip kelly news conference. Zzz.
jcmaggi::Dexter Pittman and Leandro Barbosa are going to be the big deals today.
Jrinc242.0::sad isnt it.  Rudy Gay and Harden were this years blockbusters
Dane Kitazaki::I didnt even like Shaq when he played, but he was the backbone for those 3 rings
Jrinc242.0::and no one has argued that.  but you relegating kobe to replaceable is outlandish
Dane Kitazaki::Jrinc242.0 - Kobe bailed them out so many times in the playoffs its not funny. JCMAGGI posted some of them earlier. Shaq has even given Kobe credit whats your deal bro? Why the hate?  There only in that situation because of Shaq
Jrinc242.0::Kobe bailed them out so many times in the playoffs its not funny.  JCMAGGI posted some of them earlier.  Shaq has even given Kobe credit whats your deal bro?  Why the hate?
jcmaggi::I've always liked PP. How can you not? Guy gets stabbed like a billion times, comes right back. He's a phenomenal player, unselfish, team first. Of course, there was that business with the wheel chair.........
Dane Kitazaki::Jrinc242.0 - Yes I do. I was a huge Shaq fan. But you are a moron or a hater if you think Kobe wasnt 1b to his 1a  To say he was 1b is reaching.  He was the 2nd best player, but not a 1b type of situation.
PP owns Rondo::Thank you jcmaggi. I respect Kobe. He's a killer and proved his game and heart after Shaq left.
jcmaggi::Believe me, nobody knows what Shaq meant more than I do. But to say Kobe "was a mere passenger" is ridiculous. He helped that team in some really tight spots (don't forget, the lakers didn't win anything before Kobe matured and got in to the starting line up).  Again, that's not to say Shaq wasn't the MVP, he was. Just because there are more really good 2 guards than centers doesn't mean Kobe could have been swapped out. Although I do agree with PP, PP is the only other wing in the NBA that you could have slotted with Shaq and been guaranteed at least 2 of those rings.
Jrinc242.0::Yes I do.  I was a huge Shaq fan.  But you are a moron or a hater if you think Kobe wasnt 1b to his 1a
Dane Kitazaki::Jrinc242.0 - Im done. You are an idiot  No sir, you just dont realize what Shaq meant
Jrinc242.0::Im done.  You are an idiot
PP owns Rondo::PP could've replaced Kobe and would've at least won 2 rings with Shaq. Look at what PP, KG, and Ray did at the latter stages of their careers. PP was in his prime the same time Shaq was in his prime.
Dane Kitazaki::The lakers opponents played the whole game in foul trouble because of Shaq
Dane Kitazaki::No its not, Shaq was that dominant
Return of Mystik-eye::Celtics went down faster last night than a fat boy on a bag of Cheetos!
Return of Mystik-eye::Doing good my friend.How bout U?
PP owns Rondo::I'm ok. Just don't want Danny to trade PP or KG.
PP owns Rondo::Lol
PP owns Rondo::How you doing Mystik? Long time no see.
Return of Mystik-eye::What up PP?
PP owns Rondo::Shaq would've won 3 rings if PP replaced Kobe in Shaq's prime. Also, PP was more unselfish than Kobe. He would've made it work with Shaq and those 2 would've been together for 7 or 8 more years.
jcmaggi::Unfortunately, we'll never know. But I wouldn't have bet against them.
PP owns Rondo::Guess I have to agree to disagree. Lol
Dane Kitazaki::Jrinc242.0 - I agree PP is a great player but I think he looks good on paper but losing kobe changes the dynamic of the offense AND the defense too much. I dont thnk they beat Portland or Sac in 2000, 2002  I think you are over-rating Kobes defense like the voter do every year.  The fact that he was on the 1st team is just ridiculous
Jrinc242.0::I agree PP is a great player but I think he looks good on paper but losing kobe changes the dynamic of the offense AND the defense too much.  I dont thnk they beat Portland or Sac in 2000, 2002
Jrinc242.0::but you lose your best perimeter defender who was also considered the best SG defender in the league
PP owns Rondo::Sorry Jrinc, PP is a great player and no one was stopping Shaq in his prime. He just needed a good/great secondary player to help him out. PP hits clutch shots as much as Kobe so don't try that.
jcmaggi::But like PP said, you would have gained a player who is very unselfish and is a better 3 point shooter than Kobe.
Dane Kitazaki::Kobes defense was always overrated
Jrinc242.0::i would have.  You take Kobe off that team and you lose a defensive first teamer
PP owns Rondo::I agree.
Dane Kitazaki::Agreed
ceepee2013::It was a perfect situation 4 kobrick to ease into the alpha when he had shaw , instead he forced his way to the alpha position
Dane Kitazaki::yep and failed miserably until uncle jerry sent him a present
Dane Kitazaki::Jrinc242.0 - he missed the playoffs once and it was the first season after shaq. when rudy t quit in the middle of the season  Excuses?  isnt that a fail?
Jrinc242.0::he missed the playoffs once and it was the first season after shaq.  when rudy t quit in the middle of the season
Dane Kitazaki::not even making the playoffs, demanding a trade, what else?

desmond240::because of hack a shaq
jcmaggi::Where'd you get those numbers?
Dane Kitazaki::They were winning because of him
PP owns Rondo::Shaq was a 3 time Finals MVP with the Lakers, moron. He averaged over 30 points per game. He deserved it.
jcmaggi::Also true, just because teams tried to take him out using Hack a Shaq doesn't mean it eliminates the 25 points, 12 rebounds in the first 3 quarters.
jcmaggi::where'd you get those numbers?
jcmaggi::I find all the following arguments equally ridiculous:  Kobe was a role player during the three peat Shaq was second fiddle Kobe was nothing without Shaq Shaq was nothing without Kobe  I've gone to just about every (ok maybe 80%) Lakers game since the 95-96 season, Kobe/Shaq was the greatest NBA 1-2 punch EVER. They both needed each other. Shaq had been unable to get over the hump without a great wing player and there is absolutely NO DOUBT in my mind that Kobe would not have been nearly as successful in the first half of his career if he hadn't played with Shaq.
Jrinc242.0::I agree.  It was a mutually beneficial partnership
ceepee2013::really ask nick anderson can he make a free throw
Jrinc242.0::they got swept man.  nick anderson making a free throw or two wouldnt have changed much
natanognikrow::Did Doc give Terry the green light to shoot every time he catches the ball? Killing the C's when it's an off night!
Boston33Jon::They actually don't miss him that much.  He did the same thing as Terry.  When he's hot, great, when he's not, he shouldn't even be on the court.
desmond240::he shot terrible in game 7 in 2010 against the lakers , but no one sat any thing
cdub2103::Yeah, people forget just how streaky Ray Allen got in the last couple years. He would dissapear for an entire playoff series. Of course, then he would come back and drop game winners on the Hawks like it was his job.
desmond240::never killed dallas when they won the championship
ceepee2013::team got lucky/hot at the right time
natanognikrow::different team, different results
ceepee2013::very bad addition to the celtics, they miss ray allen
Dane Kitazaki::Terry is just offense and no defense.  If hes off, he just is meaningless on the court
PP owns Rondo::Lol
PP owns Rondo::Maybe Danny isn't a snake, but we will see what else happens by 3 pm.
Dane Kitazaki::Take Kobe off and put Iverson, McGrady Lakers still win.  Take off Shaq, and replace him with someone else, they lose.  That simple
ceepee2013::this is why the laker fans keep wanting a lopsided deal like they got 2 win more chips without shaq, it wasnt just kobe willing them to both of them chips
Dane Kitazaki::yeah his team definately bailed him out in 2010
desmond240::well how would you really know . the boston big three only won 1 ring. shaq and kobe won 3 . kobe almost won three more with someone else. kobe is a winner -deal with it
Boston33Jon::There is a difference between 3 hall of fame players joining up in their late primes and 2 top 10 all-time players joined up with a great coach and supporting cast.
PP owns Rondo::The C's Big 3 should've won 2 rings. The refs stole the title from them in 2010 against LA.
Dane Kitazaki::almost won 3? He missed the playoffs as the lone player and hedemanded to be traded as the alpha dog.  It took an ex-laker in memphis to give the lakers gasol.  That was fishy
ceepee2013::3 wasn't enough
PP owns Rondo::I agree with this. Put PP in Kobe's place and La wins 3 or 4 titles. Shaq was going to get his rings in his prime with Kobe or not. He was too dominant not to be a 3 or 4 time champ.
Jrinc242.0::and jordan did nothing with out pippen and blah blah blah
desmond240::all the greats never done it on there own.... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Dane Kitazaki::Jrinc242.0 - pierce isnt a shooting guard and he didnt do ANYTHING to speak of until he had kg, ray, and rondo  Yeah just like how Kobe did nothing without Shaq, and Gasol
Jrinc242.0::pierce isnt a shooting guard and he didnt do ANYTHING to speak of until he had kg, ray, and rondo
desmond240::kobe could have had 7
Dane Kitazaki::agreed, yeah Pierce was a good replacement
ceepee2013::i dont know how many more chips the lakers would have one if kobe would have respected shaq and stepped up when needed be
Dane Kitazaki::his conditioning was an excuse to get rid of him.  Kobe and Shaq couldnt be on the same team no more, they wouldve been bickering too much.  You could tell Kobe wanted to be the guy and was getting jealous of shaq getting those nba finals mvps
desmond240::shaq was done after he left kobe -it is what it is
Jrinc242.0::how many more would they have won if shaq had stayed in shape and not come into camp overweight with some nagging injury because of the fatness
Jrinc242.0::not a chance.  nice try though
Dane Kitazaki::Shaq was the most dominant player
Jrinc242.0::no its not.  its a hypothetical scenario that you think is true
Dane Kitazaki::its true
greenmonster4918::so, the C's signed Collins to be a defensive force against big centers like Dwight, and he played 5 minutes while Howard went 10 for 12?  good job Doc.
PP owns Rondo::Lol
