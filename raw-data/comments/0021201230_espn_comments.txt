Kobelies247::And player who wants to break any NBA record just needs to play against the Portland Trail Blazers!
Reese33Ducks::no
LilVdog88::Lilard is gonna be run into the ground if Portland doesnt get a bench
bojo87::Did anyone notice Aldridge put up 30 points and 21 rebounds in only 3 quarters?!?!!?!
pdxrovermech::yeah and i noticed the lack of anyone on the court caring about anything. garbage game stats. otherwise i would have saw this more the rest of the year.
bojo87::I think aldridge and lillard wanted the win, but at the same time LA sat the entire 4th quarter while we were down like 6 or something, so yeah, they threw the towel in.
jkub5::Curry was full of it when he said he wasn't gonna try to force it lol. 11 attempts? a lot of them were pretty wild too. Still decent percentage though. #nothating
jeff050578::Now when I tell everyone Curry is the greatest 3 point shooter in the league and maybe of all time I will actually have something to back me up besides the eye test and common sense. As far as the Dubs 1st round series against the Nuggets go, I would say Denver will probably win in 6, maybe 7. However, I would never count Golden State out against anyone just because of the 3 point shooters they have. If Golden State is on fire from behind the arc they can beat anyone on any given day.
cscobra::The problem with predicting how the GSW and Nuggets series will play out is that teams teams have not played in a long time.  Denver won the season series but 3 of the 4 games were in November with Gallo but Chandler was still injured at that time.  Now Gallo is out and Chandler is in.  From all reports Faried should be ready for game 1 or game 2 at the latest.  Should be one of the more interesting series in the first round though.  Hard to see an upset, but I am biased.  Denver wins in 6
WarriorsGO::Man ive missed this whole season do to joining the Navy. Wish I could be there to watch the games but im glad we doing something special this year. Curry is a monster just like i was tryna tell people when we traded Ellis. Curry is now shining as the primary player and leader on the team.
cason26::Don't expect them to win it all.  But the city is going to enjoy every game this W's team gives us.  Very fun team to watch.  They just need to stay healthy and they can be the next OKC - Young, Fun, and Competitive
chris johnson513::How in the world was this guy not an All-Star again?
kcchen_us::He plays for the Warriors
jkub5::bruhhhh tony parker was playing at an MVP level around all-star week. you are straight disrespecting. Curry was good all season, but started to really put it on after all-star break
jkub5::bruhhhh tony parker was playing at an MVP level around all-star week. you are straight disrespecting. Curry was good all season, but started to really put it on after all-star break
DoubleV1369::sad but true. as much as i respect Tony Parker, Curry should have got the nod instead.
bearsbball12::This series will probably be a sweep by the Nuggets in the first 2 at home, split of the 2 games in GS, and Nuggets take game 5 at home to win the series.
cason26::Based on the last two games performance, that prediction can be true.  But if they bounce back to the time that they killed opponents for fun on the road, they could be a scary team. The problem with Warriors is that you never know how they play.  They can be a match for anybody if they are on and they can be out of space when they are off.
MR0908::Can't wait. Hope Bogut plays big and we get far.
cason26::Bogut is a big factor.  This W's team has D in them.  They just need a leader in the paint and that guy is Bogut.
tman8010::If you look at the standings, the West is overall better than the East. The Bucks made it with only 38 wins while the Lakers and Rockets made it into the playoffs with 45 wins. The Western part of the playoffs will be more exciting to watch.
bearsbball12::No kidding. The Nuggets would be a Leastern Conference playoff team with only their home wins.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::If Denver gets past GS, they will beat either SA or the Lakers. Will be fun seeing them run with OKC.
WarriorsWarrior::GOOD NIGHT GUYS  WARRIORS ALL DAY!
jzalvarado2.0::Now that Ive moved to Dallas though, Im following the A's more closely than the Giants because I really loathe the Rangers although my two most despised players from that team: Hamilton/Wilson are with the Angels now
CowboysGiantsWarriors::I like Oakland, but SF screws them. They should move to Sac, not Santa Clara.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::The stadium though, been to baseball and football (not to mention basketball across the parking lot). It's not baseball friendly.  What I still call Pac Bell Park is.
jzalvarado2.0::No im perfectly fine with them in Oakland.  Wish they'd remodel Mt. Davis because I love having access from BART when I'm in the Bay Area
NFLFanFreak::Jeez all the matchups in the West are better than anything the East actually offer in the 1st round.
tman8010::Definitely. Every team in the West had to have at least 45 wins. The Bucks made the playoffs with only winning 38 games.
tman8010::This matchup will be the most exciting one in the NBA first round. can't wait until Saturday.
Go_Sounders::Go Warriors! Made the trip from Pullman tonight with about 300 other Washington State students to cheer them on. Klay made us proud tonight.... Good things do come out of Wazzu after all. We’re all rooting for you on the Palouse!
NFLFanFreak::Seriously could go 6 or 7 its anybody's guess I'm not going to get over confident Denver just has a hard time getting out of the 1st round.  So Good Luck Warrior Fans see you Saturday.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::I'm truly looking forward to 220+ games man. Scoring is king.
Oaktown1029::If Warriors win one of the first 2 in Denver - it's on! coming back to Oracle for 3 and 4 - just like Dallas series! Oracle will be off the hook like no other place can.
Oaktown1029::I watched Denver play San Antonio last week in Denver - I was very impressed, they can play - if they wind up playing Spurs in second round, I think Denver will roll them - too quick and athletic for SA.
WarriorsWarrior::as a little kid i remember 1987 THE YEAR I BECAME A WARRIORS WARRIOR!
Oaktown1029::Mullin, Hardaway, and Richmond?
CowboysGiantsWarriors::if split in Denver, it could be 3-1 going back. But I expect split in both places, they are really each others poison pill.
WarriorsWarrior::agree
Oaktown1029::hey Warrior, this is unfamiliar territory, huh?
WarriorsWarrior::reds and denver fan who lives in the bay hahaha!
WarriorsWarrior::thats fair cowboy... by all rights I should be a LA fan
CowboysGiantsWarriors::it's still CA.  but i cared not for baseball or basketball until my teens.  I was hooked on the guys with stars on their helmets at 7.
WarriorsWarrior::jz you dont count you live everywhere!
CowboysGiantsWarriors::well, I like the Cowboys and 2 bay area teams. I live in the bay. Laugh all you want. :D
jzalvarado2.0::well to be fair I'm a Bay Area sports fan who lives in Dallas.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::I was a Dallas kid that moved to the bay area. Reverse!
jzalvarado2.0::VOTTO.. AGAIN I repeat.. YOU Said the exact same thing last year when the Giants played the Reds SO I ask you.. no implore you that IF the Warriors end up taking the series you don't concoct the same lame excuses you did last year and root for us the rest of the way
CowboysGiantsWarriors::wait, you remember posts from the awesome WS?  I barely remember what I ate for bfast this morn. Impressed?  Maybe...
CowboysGiantsWarriors::I do as well, which was so funny. They didn't have the pitching to win, they had really only 1 guy. Giants had 6.
jzalvarado2.0::Votto's posts are usually 'unforgettable' or 'forgettable' depending how you look at them.  I remember all the Garbage Tigers fans talking so much s.hit when the Giants were still playing the Cardinals
tman8010::that Votto guy is so stupid. he'll be crying his eyes out when the Warriors win the series
Votto4mvp050584586::no you match up worst with us. it will be a sweep. you had a better shot against the spurs or even thunder honestly
CowboysGiantsWarriors::completely disagree. Best matchup of the top 4 is Nuggets, Clippers, Spurs, Thunder, in order.
Votto4mvp050584586::dude i live in oakland. most of my friends are warriors fans and i know both teams VERY well. jimbarnett said this is a 7 game series- i LOLed. you will win 1 game if you are lucky
CowboysGiantsWarriors::calm. it's 6-7 either way. but the warriors do match up best with Denver, it's a great series.
WarriorsWarrior::yeah and the reds would sweep...
WarriorsWarrior::class-less
WarriorsWarrior::Joey Votto 4 MVP so 3 years ago...
tholar::why do I read these boards? I have not watched 1 NBA game all year, not even when DirecTV gave me free weekends.  Watched every game in the tournement though...The big dance is basketball for me.
tholar::yea, I kind of follow the players I like by reading the net, like all mu UConn Huskies and the few Oregon Ducks
CowboysGiantsWarriors::after the big dance, they go to the pro's. It's fun watching the dev of a player, fringe or not, from college to pro's, regardless of sport. Well, minus the chickshit.
jzalvarado2.0::What is this 'big dance' that you speak of?
Votto4mvp050584586::i live near oakland and went to the 2 games at oracle this season and i will be at games 3 and 4 with my chandler uni. nuggets will sweep you guys im sorry:)
NFLFanFreak::2-0 in Denver 1-1 in Oakland 1-0 back in Denver  Nuggets in 5.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::will be fun to watch no doubt.
tholar::sorry? fow winning? Don't ever be sorry, thats when you lose
CowboysGiantsWarriors::nice post. too bad you are misguided.   1-1 in Denver 1-1 in Oakland then it's a toss up best series, easily
tman8010::nope, the Nuggets will be swept
Votto4mvp050584586::LOL
Votto4mvp050584586::have fun getting swept clowns:]
jzalvarado2.0::"I'll take Things heard during last year's NLDS for 200, Alex"
WarriorsWarrior::CowboysGiantsWarriors,  We've been waiting and waiting... for this for so long... finally we have a decent TEAM!
CowboysGiantsWarriors::and a few more years of it while the youth develops. I really didn't think the new owners could do it after last year, but damn, I was wrong. Curry when healthy is really the deal man.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::good coach. Lakers f'd up.
WarriorsWarrior::totally true
Tonytouch24kt::This board just turned into an Rap awards show with everyone thanking god.
darthlobos1182::Thank god this trainwreck of a season for the Blazers is over.  What a disaster!
CBass1317::Well, they could have drafted Thomas Robinson.
tholar::Blazer luck---wins the top pick in the draft...Selects...Nerlon N from UK, who else?
jzalvarado2.0::If the Warriors get swept out of playoffs, that's 4 more games than I ever EXPECTED this season.  We're playing with house money now
CowboysGiantsWarriors::lol no 4 games, have a real shot with Denver. Matchup is good for them, SA will kill them.
WarriorsWarrior::should be fun warriors fans!   2 times in 19 seasons!
CowboysGiantsWarriors::feels sarcastic. it's been 37 since the last ring - and nobody believed in us then either.  But we had Rick Barry. Curry isn't Rick, thank god.
NFLFanFreak::LOL Kobe Tweeting.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::All bow to the new 3 point king of the NBA.  Stephen Curry.
Tonytouch24kt::I thought there would never be a jumper as smooth as Ray Allen's. I think I might be wrong.
CBass1317::Thompson reminds me so much of Allan Houston with that quick high release and his big body.  Curry has the more traditional, and beautiful, shooting pocket form.  Win win.
Tonytouch24kt::Curry.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::CBass- shocking they have 2 with such sweet shots and young. Depends on the night, but they both call out the other guy as the better shooter.
CBass1317::Curry or Thompson?
tholar::both teams played hard
CBass1317::ball don't lie
CowboysGiantsWarriors::T! 2 shots...
WarriorsWarrior::gsw &lt; denver  but who cares  go warriors!
CowboysGiantsWarriors::u know, while it sucks to be so basic, they made the playoffs.  Go Warriors!
CowboysGiantsWarriors::I'd say I hate the 49ers, but I like Jim. So I can't hate. :(
WarriorsWarrior::cowboys? smh!
tholar::not to worry portland Jackson is on the way
Tonytouch24kt::WOW
Oaktown1029::Houston tanking in Phoenix the other night appears to have backfired on them!
barteltd::Why would they tank in Phoenix?
Oaktown1029::you're probably right, I just got caught up in all this tanking talk.
barteltd::Hmmm.  Would have been easier to have beaten Phoenix and then tank tonight when the know the outcomes of all the other games, but hey, it is was it is.
Oaktown1029::they wanted no part of Denver, they thought SA would be a better matchup for them - imo.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::liking yourself seems to have backfired on you.
Oaktown1029::okay, I just liked myself then, lol.
barteltd::That's why I always like myself if someone else likes me.  Then people won't think the first one was me.
Oaktown1029::you new to these boards ace?
MTN_HIGH_CO::self love is the best kind of love.  but this was not the case.
MTN_HIGH_CO::can't agree enough with this comment.  lol
CowboysGiantsWarriors::Warriors v Lakers, 2nd round Warriors win in 6 What a season
barteltd::One round at a time folks.
MTN_HIGH_CO::dreaming that Lakers and Warriors make it to the second round.  Unless you are talking about a NIP tournament they are playing.
MTN_HIGH_CO::NIT = not in tournament.  NIP = Not in Playoffs.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::NIP tournament. are you being sexual?
MTN_HIGH_CO::Nuggets in 5.  2 home wins, split away games and final game in Altitude.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::not likely. but still, 220+ each game will be fun.
WarriorsWarrior::GG PORTLAND GL NXT YR
23germany::TANKING...every team that tanks deserves bad luck  they should play to win. instead they try to lose that is ridiculous and i will forever hate it
Tonytouch24kt::It's not the best setup but I guarantee that Portland was not trying to lose 12 straight to close the season. They started their slide in contention for the playoffs.
23germany::i wish them at least a couple torn ACLs
Tonytouch24kt::Rough, why's that?
Tonytouch24kt::Thanks, I think....
23germany::blazers deserve another greg oden/david bowie lottery surprise for their ridiculous tanking   this NBA april has been worst ever......free wins for every team that needed it
MTN_HIGH_CO::Nuggets are going to have to defend the 3 ball.  40.3% is the only thing I am worried about for this series.
Oaktown1029::and we have to keep Denver off the boards - the one thing i'm worried about.
Oaktown1029::we're strong in those areas as well.
MTN_HIGH_CO::steals?  bench play?  points in the paint?  fast break points?
Tonytouch24kt::I think it's funny the Lakers are celebrating making the playoffs. Lakers fans are supposed to celebrate Championships.
StrategistX7::they don't have the draft pick. It will go to Cleveland or another team. can't remember which.
barteltd::The eighth seed is the least dangerous place for the Lakers to land.  If they missed the playoffs and went into the lottery you know that Mr. Sterns magic ping pong balls would get them the #1 pick.
StrategistX7::Golden State (47-35) had to wait for the game between the Lakers and Rockets to finish before learning their first-round opponent in the playoffs. What? can someone tell me why? I thought they are facing the Nuggets no matter how.
StrategistX7::well then I wonder why ESPN wrote that in the recap section.
NFLFanFreak::That was if GS lost since they won they knew their Opponent was going to be Denver.
Oaktown1029::we are - that game decides who is #7 and #8
NFLFanFreak::Stern really wants Lakers vs. Spurs.
Oaktown1029::LOL, the Rockets are finding out what the Warriors went through on Friday night - free throws galore for the Lakers in the 4th.
CowboysGiantsWarriors::47 wins. tank that baby!
MTN_HIGH_CO::we will see you at home, Dubsteps.
