Anton::What is happening to Earl Clark?
T W::There appears to be a huge statistical difference between JJ Hickson today and Mozgov yesterday.  And the Nuggets are losing by double digits.  Any ideas as to why a guy that grabbed 20 rebounds last night is not playing?  Did he get hurt?.
Cyril::If you're going to start Alonzo Gee at small forward, you might as well get Carrick Felix in the lineup.  At the very least he could do some skateboard tricks at halftime to keep the crowd entertained.
John M::Just when you think the Nuggets might have turned it around, they go into Cleveland and lose to the Cadavers - nice job, Denver.
PKM::Denver has been playing really well.  Lawson is a great guy to have on your side.
bird::hopefully they no longer change MVP when Kyrie takes free throws, that is embarrassing.
OKCKevinDurant::I am looking forward to see Lawson-Kyrie matchup
Commenter::when Nate is on he's real fun to watch. I see he is back with former teammates Wilson Chandler and Gallinari
Henry::Dropping Harrison Barnes for Tristan Thompson??  Good or bad?
faithwalker::was at the game and it finally seems to be a better rotation for the CAVS then what they have been presenting...still want to see some stability with the lineup but it is coming together.....
