stgoat::I love you.
Kobetard:::(
stgoat:::) &lt;3
The Peanut Master::The drubbing that started it all...
karelp::MJ must be so proud.
roastbeafman87::You know a game was ugly when Thabeet grazes the highlights not once, but TWICE.
James Harden 3 point Celebration::that westbrook dunk was sooo nasty
ruedsone10::OMG https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3hFMBh2xFk&amp;feature=plcp

RayNy2ATL::At least the panthers won...
joest2003::Kemba and Sessions  combined 1 for 15??? I dont think they could do that again if they wanted to.
bridgerj89::That is what happens when one of the best teams in the NBA hits on all cylinders, and a young lower tier team has a very off night. I've been watching Charlotte all season, and even I believed that was unfathomable before last night. The whole backcourt, Kemba, Ramon, and BG, was awful. With Thomas and Biyombo out, Haywood was asked to fill the lane, an impossible task, and Byron Mullens played worse than even I could imagine  he would ever play. The Thunder are still probably the best team in the West, but there is no excuse to lay down like that. I wouldn't mind if they were beaten by 40...sometimes you just miss everything...as long as they gave 100% effort, and that's something I didn't see. I hope to see a big improvement Wednesday against Atlanta.
Rambomonster9::Random Stat: Jimmer and Durant average the same points per minute......
Chargers_4_Sale::Good news: The game is over with. Bad news: You have one more game left against the Thunder.
Rosstafarian5371::As a Bobcats fan I'm just trying to focus on the positives, 7-6 record, same amount of wins through 13 games as we had all of last year, good coach, good GM, MJ staying out of pretty much all basketball related issues.
Mr. Nut Job::Don't read too much into the score.  The Bobcats had a Bad night with a much better team at this time.
fresh3155::Well the Bobcats cannot get any worse, so at least that is a uhmmmm positive to take away from this game?  Turrible.  I wish these college kids would learn to stay longer in school...Jeremy Lamb could have still been getting better at UCONN but now averages 1.6 points a game.  Good luck being more than a 2-3 year player when you dont get the chance to really improve.
duro.::look at it this way, if only the 4th quarter counted, its a tie game =)
roastbeafman87::This score makes a lot more sense when you see that Kemba was scoreless.
Dondi716::you can't be serious
Matt Mininni::Looks like we're back to old form. Hopefully this was just a fluke.
KYRIEALLTHEWAY::THUNDER ALL DAY THEY BLEW THEM OUT LIKE IT WAS NOTHIN LML
milw-jay::"We're back....."  -   2011-2012 Charlotte Bobcats
I3UTTON::Hasheem Thabeet &gt; best player on the Bobcats
266Joe::Using a bet system named sportsbettingstar. In the past couple months I have averaged around 2-3K a month profit just following this system. You can find this system on google by searching for basketball betting system.
milw-jay::Really?   How much did you lose before you started winning?
jaguada26::wow, and people thought the Bobcats where getting back on track?
I3UTTON::lol a Seattle fan that conveniently roots for the Lakers, hmmm. After the Sonics left Seattle you must have said to yourself, "which bandwagon should I hop onto now?"
tommylikirk::^ burn
TCluvcarpanthers::They still have a better record than your Lakers WHEN REBUILDING, so...
MPerce4::Yikes. Bobcats looked as bad as the Thunder when they first got to OKC. 3-29 before we hired Scotty Brooks. But we kept coming to the games, because "holy crap I get to watch Kobe destroy a terrible team in person!" At least the Cats still have a winning record, and are doing infinitely better than last year.
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::"The franchise's worst blowout previously had been a 112-68 defeat against Portland on Feb. 1."  Love the fact that they have a comparable score in their franchise, not only in history but within the last year!  I feel bad for fans of this team.. and I'm a Warriors fan FFS.
TCluvcarpanthers::Lol. Trust me; we feel bad for you guys too. Enjoy your mediocrity.
Neil826::the thunder were horrible in the finals, let them have these worthless games.
MPerce4::...did we watch the same finals? Every game but the last one was ridiculously close.
scabbfan::Most fga's by any OKC player was nine (9). Durant &amp; westbrook only took 8 shots, and they scored 114 &amp; won 45 pts..  kobe are you listening, kobe.  Hello kobe, kobe.........
farooq_am::Now that's the Bobcats team I know and love!
LegendaryMaestro::79-25 at one point in the 3rd quarter. this is embarassing bobcats.
milw-jay::Really?    How can an NBA team, at any point in any game, be down 54 points to another team??  Unless they were playing 5 on 4 ?   Was the bobcats rim 15 feet high? Were they not allowed to wear sneakers??   I really cant fathom this...
lifan36::This was an embarrassing game for the Cats.  At one point the score was like 75 to 25.  I can't remember seeing a lopsided game like this and I've been watching NBA for 25 years.
NTCal01::The only thing I've ever seen that was comparable wasn't even in the pros. Army lost a game to Duke 100-42 after falling behind 82-18.
macbook26::Bobcats had 69 on OKC. Giggity.
memfisblues::What's the worst a team you played for (as a kid or whatever) has ever been beaten?  My team lost once by a score of about 89-24... horrible.
zackdaddy85::Honestly lost 92-2 in middle school, 2 a team with 3 future d-1 players, I was center of my team at like 5'8 My dad was coach and almost kicked the other coaches a$$  for running up the score, they had to escort the coach out haah(was a church league too haha)..but it was rough 92-2
memfisblues::wow... amazing!
DeputyDean01::In county bball i outscored a team by myself with 22 points. I am a horrific basketball player
266Joe::Tiller you live in your moms basement
tillersouthpaw::I do okay on my own. people always call me before bets, how do i start my own business?
266Joe::Ive been using this betting system named Sportsbettingstar for the past couple months now. Making around 2-3K a month profit following the system. You can find the system on google by searching for sports betting system online. If you bet on sports you gotta check this system out.
tillersouthpaw::Thunder coach Scott Brooks said after the game: “It’s obviously one of our best games we’ve played on both ends of the floor. It’s a combination of a few things. We really played good basketball, passing, defending and they had a bad night. Let’s face it. (Charlotte) has been playing good basketball to start the season. We all will go through a game like this. It happens.”
Matt Mininni::Class
theSOONERthebetter12::i didnt get to watch the game but is Thabeet a baller all of a sudden, or is a lot of it just hype and being on a good team?
tillersouthpaw::If you're a Thunder fan, then you also understand that this just made Russell even more aggressive. Just wait, you'll see.
tillersouthpaw::If Kevin Durant was giving you high fives for fouling a guy hard, how would you feel?
tillersouthpaw::He was told from day one, "we just want you to do what you do. Fouls don't matter. just give us minutes. But give us everything you have when you're out there." Everybody loves him on the team. I think he feels like he found his team.
tillersouthpaw::I really don't understand how any OKC fan could ever diss Perkins. We only got Perkins for his Defense. Do you remeber Nenad Krstic? This was a great upgrade. It worked. We are tougher and we needed the leadership from a champion. Every great defensive player makes the offensive player better. I don't care who is on the offense!
Rolltide4203::no hes awful. I think hes the worst player by far in the league.
zackdaddy85::Yeah thunder don't make finals run without perkins, he is underrated
dpnorris::I like Perks toughness, but thats about all he truly gives.
tillersouthpaw::-says every Thunder starter
siralamosa::Apparently, Charlotte's players developed food poisoning as the game wore on.  Okay, I'm making that up, but it looked like they were sick.
Miami_Heat_champs_FTW::We are who we thought they were.
tillersouthpaw::How do we know who they are or do we?
visorman23::hasheem thabeet for MVP
tillersouthpaw::how long until jeremy lamb, reggie jackson, and a first round pick get traded?
tillersouthpaw::lol
visorman23::so is mvp
tillersouthpaw::comeback player of the year is in the mix. Guaranteed
Tyler24158::I don' think there are any more bobcats fans. The only ones are the ones wishing MJ was still playing and the little kids who live around charlotte who just like the team around them.
TCluvcarpanthers::At least we have real fans that support the team through thick and thin....  *cough cough* bandwagon Lakers fan.
tillersouthpaw::No. They're out there and they love their team. Reminds me of Steeler fans.
tillersouthpaw::I guarantee Jordan could have suited up and he would have made it better. The Cats looked horrible.
tillersouthpaw::82-29 when the starters left. WOW! Are there going to be fines?
EaglesFan_4-Life::Bobcats did their best. Leave them alone trolls
tillersouthpaw::Says the eagles fan avoiding the eagles board....troll.
HawksCubs10::82 - 29..   Wow, my team blew a 27-point lead  tonight but I feel a little bit better now.
tillersouthpaw::It doesn't matter. We only need one more win to pass last year!  -Every Bobcats Fan
dont_hate_the_playa_hate_the_game::2 questions:  1.) how do you lose by 45? and  2.) how do you only score 69 points in an nba game?
NTCal01::Utah lost a Finals game to Chicago 96-54 one year... Malone was the only Jazz player in double figurees.
