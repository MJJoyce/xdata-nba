austuc33::i guess no bucks fan you think they going to the playoffs
nba is the worst::They are a 4 seed, will very likely make it
oneandonlybabe::Not a Bucks fan, but they could make it
nba is the worst::I don't quite get the hype over the 20 pt games to start the season "record".  Wilt's 126 over 2 seasons will never be matched, and as for consecutive games, since 1990, MJ had 69, Kobe 63, Iverson 57, lebron 49, Tmac 45.  So just create a special category for "from the start of the season" - bfd
oneandonlybabe::I quite agree. I think it's just that some people are obsessed with 'stats' Come to think of it, I would have thought you'd be all for it. I couldn't care less about these 'records' even for my fave players. I look at overall quality of play and team contribution first.
