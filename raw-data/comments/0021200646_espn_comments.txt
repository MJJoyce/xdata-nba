L.OF HATERS ARE RACISTS AND LIVE IN MOMMAS BASEMENT::HERRO, GOOD TO SEE HAREN NOT JACKING UP 5-30 FG% IN THIS GAME.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BREADMAN;)
DuaneXC::Dan Haren?
rEdBuLxTaSy::THE ROX USUALLY WINS WHEN HARDEN KEEP HIS SHOTS UNDER 20 AND LIN MAKE 12-15 SHOTS PER GAME.  THAT USUALLY MEANS THE ENTIRE TEAM ARE BENEFITING UNDER "TEAM" BASKETBALL = MORE BALANCE OFFENSIVE TEAM:):):)
wilhenderso 6::LOL Daisy Williams still shaking the sand from his vag after Lin lit him up last year.  Goes to show what kind of a leader he is by taking the rest of his teammates out of the game early!
pfoote14::Rockets should sign Delonte West to be backup point guard.   I think Delonte's character is not as bad as many think. I've met him hes a nice guy. The time off probably did him good. He's a really solid player. Why not bring him in Houston for a minimum contract?
tungcn2010::Rockets right now are too nice, we need a mean guy.
Marshallv84::How does Harden get to the ft line so much?  Kobe, Dwade and most the PGs in the west attack the rim as much.. He seems like he flops a lot
Undisputed Heavyweight World Champion::Seriously guy don't talk unless you watch the games.
tungcn2010::Do you even watch any of the Rockets games? He gets hacked everytime he drives to the hoop, but only gets half the calls...
TXtarheel44::Well Brooklyn has cool jersey's at least....
Sugar Ray Robinson::This Nets team isn't going to get anywhere unless Williams is consistently aggressive and assertive.   I don't get it, he can score at will yet he becomes extremely timid, today he scored 20 in the 1st and only 7 the rest of the game. He is the franchise player!! In my opinion the 2nd best PG in the L.   He's so talented but he's reluctant to take over on a daily basis. I can't figure him out.
brothertin9394::Would that be physical limitation? Eg he has got tired after Q1?!
Astro_eng::Simple, he's a LOSER
vermincain2::Jeremy Lin keeps working on making everybody forget that he had 8 good games last year...
Dawan208::Why do you say that?  Oh I get it you're another troll!   14points,  2 steals (3rd in the league buddy with steals) and 9 assist is not making any one forget what he can do!!!!!
sports guy12::Deron Williams showed once again how immature he is
tungcn2010::notice how McHale has Lin Playing in the last 6-10 minutes of the 4th quarter the last two games????  If you pay attention, when McHale talks to both Harden and/or Lin, they both seem uninterested to what he's saying.
JacktownSaintsfan::Lin's been playing good
Ontario925::Rockets completely own both NYC area NBA teams for years.
Kerry2953::Go ROCKETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!           http://RocketsVsNetsHighlights.qr.net/kerryblog
Ontario925::If the Nets played in the West Conference they would be 7th seed now. The Knicks would not be much better as a 5th seed team in the West Conference. Minus the Heat the East Conference has been a weaker Conference in the NBA for many years. Nothing new about the East being weaker this season. The East is still more mediocre. The same in every other Sport the last couple of years. The strongest teams in every Sport are West and South now not East and North.
sports guy12::Nets in the West wouldn't be in the playoffs
tungcn2010::more like the 17th seed
Theironrod2012::rumor has it, Lin suck
cfylong::He sucks yo mama's di ck.
erika835-BLUESHIRTS::Thats something every household should already know lol
k_nak::This Houston team should sign Kenyon Martin unless there's something about him that I don't know such as being a bad teammate.  Seems like they could use some backup big man.
EasyRun18::Kenyon Martin should be better than many backup bigs, still younger than many but couldn't find a job in NBA this season, even Delonte West  will re-join NBA soon.
bsimon30::There not looking at signing another role player. There keeping their cap space low to sign another superstar
erika835-BLUESHIRTS::He dont want lin as his pg!
erika835-BLUESHIRTS::Is the enemy of my enemy a friend... or an enemy??? -The Rockets/Lin/Lintardes
TXtarheel44::just an idiot like yourself
Lin-Only Fan::LOF Report  Jeremy Lin will be in attendance Sunday,1/27/13, for the festival's final screening, of the documentary "Linsanity." The screening begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Rose Wagner Performing Arts Center, 138 W. 300 South, Salt Lake City.          Don't miss watching our star.
JustPlayBall1234::Would you have liked it better if LinOnly Fan had said "the Rockets" instead of Lin's Rockets? So petty. And btw, Lin is already the face of the franchise in case you didn't already know. Ask management how they market the team every chance they get. How they plaster Lin's face everywhere.  Besides, the writer was explaining about why and how Lin and some of his teammates were able to go to Sundance. Dawan208, you are an idiot.
Lin-Only Fan::It's called " LOF" Report  Good night.
Lin-Only Fan::Lin's Rockets are playing host to the Brooklyn Nets tonight. But the Rockets are in Salt Lake City on Monday night to play the Jazz, so Lin's arriving a day early to make an appearance at Evan Jackson Leong's documentary about him.  Couple of Jeremy's teammates will accompany him to the festival.
Dawan208::erika835-BLUESHIRTS - Lins rockets? What is that a Joke? He will never be the face of that franchise, not ever!  Harden is there one and only Captain. Are you gonna flag me for that LOF?  No the team also has Delphino, Parson And Patterson as co-captains.  It's their team too!!!!
erika835-BLUESHIRTS::Lins rockets? What is that a Joke? He will never be the face of that franchise, not ever!  Harden is there one and only Captain. Are you gonna flag me for that LOF?
Selvin4715::huh?
Selvin4715::Asik looked like Shaq today
DuaneXC::I don't understand how he has 0 pts. / 6 rebs. in one game and then 20 pts. / 16 rebs. in a game a week later against a much better team....He also blew up for 20/18 against Chicago.
tungcn2010::Shaq has never been as good as Asik.
inquisitiveman::Rockets have played 46 games already...most in NBA..
Ontario925::Houston Rockets owns NYC area NBA teams for years. 12 wins in a row over Nets. They have owned the Knicks for over 10 years losing only a couple games. Houston Rockets mastery over NYC area NBA teams continues. The Rockets have won more NBA Championships since 1994 than both NYC area Knicks and Nets combined.
Boyanime2K13::lol
WOOPZZZ::you're scary
sagematic::Did u hear abt that kid in Texas who killed his mother and sister after watching the jason movie three times?
inquisitiveman::call me jason
inquisitiveman::Nets would not make the playoffs if they were playing in the west.
BXwarriorBX::rockets lose its the coaches fault rockets win and lin sucks in the game he still gets a pat on the back haha funny
WOOPZZZ::14 pts and 9 assists suck?? your stat analysis sucks
Dawan208::Yea.
WOOPZZZ::sup dawan. u still here
Dawan208::He's a troll.  Ignore him!
WOOPZZZ::make it a ferrari. that's way cooler
BXwarriorBX::lin sucks why you guys compare him to real players?
JustPlayBall1234::Lin may not be the best player, but you are obviously either biased or ignorant coz he definitely did not suck tonight.
ASUB-ballfan::Harden!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Undisputed Heavyweight World Champion::Is amazing!
dr_gonzo_phdsd::the nets should move back to new jersey out of respect to Bk.
MolasseScorpion1986::12th consecutive win. Rockets &gt; Nets.
IPITYTH3F00L::Still don't understand PJs rotation. Where's Marshon? The Hawks and Blazers are laughing their way home tonight. Thanks for Joe and Gerald, overpaid f**king bums. Oh, forgot Humphries. Billy King is the biggest tool in the NBA.
heatonomics::@ Premo S. that was the best laugh that I've had all night. You've been crying like a little B.ITCh all night long after your crappy NETS got their a.ss handed to them. You have the nerve to threaten to beat me up...are you kidding? LMAO You couldn't even beat up a fly if it was tied up. hahaha. Take away Lopez and your team is in last place in the East. You are a funny guy. I am looking forward to the next blowout when the Rockets give you guys another whooping. I am also looking forward to seeing the Heat beat the crap out of your team as well.
rightersbloc::I have no idea what game the Houston announcers are watching...they are the worst.
bsimon30::Bill Worrell is the best
Selvin4715::Be nice, Bill Worrel is getting up there is age.
jscmedia::If any fans want to have a real basketball conversation about the game head over to Clutchfans. net  It's just not worth wading through all the trash here....
A Cane Thang::BROOKLYN: Wants to play with big boys.

luckywin7::lol you still here?
luckywin7::wow large beer, large meal, large tx state and  Independence than 49 states
Jackiemoonsexy::<b><i>Who is overrated Lin or D-Will?</i></b>
JustPlayBall1234::DWill could be the better player but will NEVER be a sensation and do what Lin did for the Knicks in New York. Poor Will.
sportsfan1014::the fact is, what Lin has done for the Knicks in 2 weeks &gt; what DWill has done for the Nets in 3 years but they both better than Felton though
HoustonSports27::Lin, but D-will is a twa.t
nbafan411::both
ScrewedUpTexan713::Aight Rockets fans Nets fans good win for the Rockets Nets still a good team just not tonight deuce ! .......(Premo S its not the end of the world dont slit your wrist or you wont be alive for the next blowout )
Balldinho2::Ha, d-Will --&gt; Lin, Wins... FATALITY
sportsfan1014::trust me, DWill knows that more than anyone
walle D_ D::wonder what he said to $@%! off the reff  "High nice game were having"   - williams "Fu2" -Ref
walle D_ D::Why the hell are the nets paying so much money to humprhies, he's not even starting over evans.
azeboogie18::even we cant stand the guy anymore the only reason he was paid so much was to match contracts so a future trade  that the reason he was only given a 2 yr deal
sportsfan1014::because he had a sexy wife?
sportsfan1014::great drama it was
walle D_ D::lmao, his wife got that contract, and split real quick
heatonomics::@Premo You seem to be a major sore loser. Your team lost, don't be an a.ss about it. I'm not a fan of either Brooklyn or the Rockets, but it is pretty obvious that Houston has a much better team than both NY teams. They have been destroying NY teams all season long. Oh, and no one really thinks that Brooklyn is going to go that deep in the playoffs. Accept the loss and stop trolling.
Premo S::bet you wouldn't say s h i t to my face, because you'd b laying out cold in a puddle of your own drool fool ..
nigga_will::what kind of b.i tch talks about whooping someone's a** on an internet message board HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA @Premo S you have no friends.
azeboogie18::houston is 3-7 there last 10 games cant play defense, is the 8th seed if winning a championship only meant beating a ny team then houston takes the trophy home but its not but ny teams have better records are ranked higher get more publicity have better all around players come on now do i have to bring facts out
JustPlayBall1234::Sounds like jealousy to me. Are you a Knicks fan?
indplayer::lol of course ny teams have better records. they play in the weak $@% eastern conf. look up the rockets record against eastern conf teams then talk.
Premo S::heatonomics I will b i t c h slapp your $@% into another galaxy .. keep it up and you will get a foot up your !$@
heatonomics::@Premo S. Are you mad that you crappy Nets team is like the whipping post of the league? You make the rest of your team's fans look really bad by acting like a little B.itch. If I ever see you in person, I'm going to B*Slap your dumb a.ss
ScrewedUpTexan713::Hes been askin for tampons ...
KeriTheCreoleTexan::Truth spoken well.
Boyanime2K13::Rocket fans are so stupid
xmasskull2::butthurts that bad,huh.
Premo S::Houston has one of the highest crime indexes in the USA .. Houston, what a ghetto s h i t t y city .. full of a bunch of dumb, obese, illiterate idiots
jscmedia::Why are some NY losers such whiners? Clearly you have never been in Houston.   Just because the Rockets rule both teams is no reason to be such a debbie downer!  here's an idea, make a trip here and stop making stuff up. p.s. It was 79 under blue skies today.
Chris050581::Come on, ladies. Both places suck it's like arguing whether the grimlen or the pacer was a better car
Premo S::http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/tx/houston/crime/  u dumb idiot
HoustonSports27::on what fuc.king website?
Premo S::its on the internet .. crime index means out of 100 (being the safest) Houston comes in at a 5 .. meaning, GHETTO
HoustonSports27::Its funny cause he has to make up all this shi.t
Boyanime2K13::Nobody cares about Jersey. Houston sucks
ScrewedUpTexan713::Is Brooklyn full of dumb crying babies that act like b.itches over a basketbll game  ?
xmasskull2::yes
bobbydagreat::Still better than Jersey....
bobbydagreat::The Nets are an "Eastern Conference 7". You know it's sort of like how a female can be an "Oklahoma 9" which is equivalent to a "Houston 3". An Eastern conference 7 is equivalent to a Western Conference 4.
walle D_ D::" I cant count that high"  - Premo
walle D_ D::Robert Lopez.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brook Lopez    fact
walle D_ D::based on the fact that brook lopez cant rebound for crap
Boyanime2K13::Must be from Houston- Dummy
sportsfan1014::Jhow about Jennifer?
ScrewedUpTexan713::LOL @Jonathan_Feigen dealing with those upset Nets fans they gettin serious lol
jscmedia::Jonathan is an excellent BB reporter. clueless............................
Boyanime2K13::Nets Fans are right. he's a dummy
ScrewedUpTexan713::why just cause he said DW didnt man up and comment about the game lol
sportsfan1014::98% of Nets fans are very nice, just some bad apples try to make them look bad
phillysgreatest88::Brooklyn is offended to have the Nets, as they will be more offended when the Islanders come to town.  Move the Nets back to NJ and keep the Isles at in Uniondale.
walle D_ D::you just got the nets of course your proud, until williams leaves, and you cant sign anybody because of jounsons contract
sportsfan1014::they had the Dodgers
Boyanime2K13::Brooklyn is proud of the Nets and Islanders
01.02.2013::Great Team effort by all the starters.   Good to see Asik showed up this game after being MIA against NOLA
ScrewedUpTexan713::So thats back to back blowout of New Jersey Nets ...lol
woodylamb::Nets are a yo yo team.
Boyanime2K13::Losing by 13 is not a blowout dummy
ScrewedUpTexan713::it aint close either lol
xmasskull2::Yep, Nets suck!
Jason Stone Lee::When Lin play PG, very aggressive with confidence. Team turnovers down a lot. Last game: Lin + Harden TOs = 12 This game: Lin + Harden TOs = 6 If TOs is there, it is better to happened on your PG!
Premo S::Jonathan Feigen likes boys
Premo S::Texas ranks 36th in the country in literacy .. wow that makes a lot of sense
Premo S::sucks to be held back in grade school huh walle .. it's ok, you'll learn english eventually
walle D_ D::Brooklyn sucks balls at just about everything, thats why every one I know from their claims to be from new York, and leaves out the brooklyn part.
