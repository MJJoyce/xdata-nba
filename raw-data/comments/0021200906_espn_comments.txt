fjr_ns@yahoo.com::The lakers are broken and a few are out of shape compared to where they should be (*cough*dwight*cough*). They also have been devoid of all their good players, while those players are healthy, for the whole season. Whether its Dwight, Steve Nash, Pau, Steve Blake, or Jordan hill we have been without a full squad the whole year. Add to that the wasted preseason and training camp focused on a worthless and eventually scrapped offensive and defensive schemes. It's hard to put a defense and offense together in between games. It's also very difficult to be competitive after back surgery. You have to get back in shape because you don't work out much while your back heals. It takes about a year after your back heals from the surgery. Dwight will be 100% next year but I doubt he gets there this year.   Lakers can still do it if they make the playoffs and get all the peices together before then.
I-cant-post-_-::Against the hornets most elite teams play their bench by the 3rd quarter.. Way to be proud of beating one of the worst teams in the league..

When a man has broken records, won championships, endured tremendous criticism and responsibility, why judge? Let's toast him as the greatest player ever."

Bill GOAT potus::Russel was like 6'9"...he was great. I do give credit to Kareem for his longevity and the skyhook. They did not play in the same era, hard to compare.
Jrinc242.0::hakeem should have never been a 6th seed that year....
gatorfan808::I would put Hakeem a lot higher.  Russell had played with a lot of Hall of Famers.  Hakeem took a 6th seed to the title.  Not Bird, not Magic not MJ, not Kobe, not Lebron, did this.

lakersfann1990::LOL
Bill GOAT potus::I agree with your Kareem post...I dont care what he was like off the court...he was the best on it and funny in the Airplane Movie.
lakersfann1990::We can all agree that Shaq was one of the best centers in laker history but no big man including future (Dwight)  will ever over take the legacy Kareem left with this team.   When Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left the game in 1989 at age 42, no NBA player had ever scored more points, blocked more shots, won more Most Valuable Player Awards, played in more All-Star Games or logged more seasons. His list of personal and team accomplishments is perhaps the most awesome in league history: Rookie of the Year, member of six NBA championship teams, six-time NBA MVP, two-time NBA Finals MVP, 19-time All-Star, two-time scoring champion, and a member of the NBA 35th and 50th Anniversary All-Time Teams. He also owned eight playoff records and seven All-Star records.
gatorfan808::Makes you wonder why it took so damn long for his statue to go up.  Not to mention all the national championships he brought to UCLA.

gatorfan808::The Lakers 3 peat, Shaq was the focal point, Kobe felt a certain time it was he turn to lead the Lakers.  If you take an entire career, Kobe had a better NBA career than Shaq.  Very few guys going on age 34 playing a position that needs athletcism can dominate.  Jordan and Kobe are the only two.
Jrinc242.0::I noticed that clown never told us his team
gatorfan808::Jordan's most amazing accomplishments is when he had homecourt adj in the playoffs, Bulls never lost a series.  Never lost a Finals.  His best game of 69 points, he shot 23-27 from the field.  Kobe's 81 point game was crazy but he did take 19 more shots than MJ.  If MJ took 19 more shots in that game against the Cavs, he would have been near 100.
ahwi_quacoe::If if if ........
BigGameJames42Greatness::MJ never faced a team with equal or more talent; of course he never lost in the Finals.  Go back and look at Detroit Bad Boys; Till they got older and Isiah got injured, they could not get past them.  MJ is probably the GOAT for me too but don't get crazy.  Who were they going to lose to?  Ewing and the Knicks or Portland that Magic beat on his down days without Kareem? Or Utah who was an older veteran team?
Jrinc242.0::gatorfan808 - Boston was an old team.  Look at detroit they were champs in 1990 but by the time 92 season, age was showing.  Boston can still play but their stars have seen better days.  they beat out a 60 win cavs team.  made lebron quit.
gatorfan808::Boston was an old team.  Look at detroit they were champs in 1990 but by the time 92 season, age was showing.  Boston can still play but their stars have seen better days.  Look at Nash now, not the same. Even Metta, not the same.

Sad thing is that they can't beat any of the teams ahead of them on the road.  They beat GS once but this team still hasn't proved it can win on the road against a good team.  Defense looks horrible for the last 7 of 8 quarters. 69 points in the first half by NO and 71 points at the half by Thunder, this team still  has a long way to go on the defensive end.
larshook::If the Lakers get in the playoffs it will be a moonwalk with 41 or 42 wins.

Bill GOAT potus::Kobe in the playoffs averages 25 points on 45% shooting from the field.   Stop trying to make him sound better, 25 points on 45% shooting is pretty good averages.
lifan36::Kobe as a starter = 28 pts on 46% shooting.
Bill GOAT potus::Lebron is at 28 and 47%...but his career is only about 1/2 over. I doubt he will be considered the greatest when it is all said and done.
Bill GOAT potus::Jordan 33 Points on 49%...career playoff.  Kobe is good...hes just not the best. He isolates too often and shoots contested shots too often.
