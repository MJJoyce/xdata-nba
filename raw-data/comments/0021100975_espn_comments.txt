lintebowuk11::JODIE!!!!
milwaukeemonster::we are stuck in pergatory..  not good enough for the playoffs  and not bad enough to get a top five pick...
Rick-Da-Villain::Its funny da bulls and their fans wants the heat so bad in the playoffs...while other teams and their fans are scared to play the heat....SMDH
68steve13::I’ve been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 3 months straight now following this system. I found this system by Google searching the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for  anyone that is looking for a system that actually works and is tired of not winning your bets
darkyam::My question is: if Evan Turner and the 76ers want the Bulls, why did they win tonight?  They're already locked into the playoffs and the Bulls are locked into the top seed.  Rest your starters and get the matchup you claim you want.  As a Bulls fan, I think the Bulls would rather take on Philly than the Knicks, so everyone would be happy.
eessbb12::Definitely. Sixers struggled in all the match ups against the heat this season.
tank_dogg06::Definitely rather face the Bulls. Heat have dominated against Philly. Bulls are 2-1 but their victories by slim margins.
IrishGuy1026::Did Evan Turner ball out?
4th_Owns_Lebron::"I was just trying the Kobe system"  -Evan Turner
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::Bucks are gonna need a lot of help this offseason
doctajhawk::will gooden/ellis/ilyasova play tmrw?
GetHype21::Story of the year. The Sucks could not beat a good team when it counted! I think it's time to bring and NHL team to Milwaukee!
JDunifon3::I bet Columbus would trade you the Blue Jackets...
StevoBurrito::Thanks for benching Ilyasova and ruining my fantasy team, Skiles.
bulls00613::It is going to be funny watching the 76ers and Knicks both try and lose tomorrow night. It just won't matter, both teams getting eliminated in 5 games.
tank_dogg06::Wouldn't get too cocky. Bulls are 2-1 against Philly and their wins were by less than 10.
bulls00613::Bulls actually want the knicks, they know that the 76ers play harder then the knicks
Flyguys623 2.1::yeh. peace man. once again, good luck if we play you
bulls00613::I will bet you that the Knicks will rest Melo and Chandler tomorrow.
bulls00613::Exactly, I mean if Wade and Lebron got called for all their hacking, they wouldn't be so effective. Instead they get praised for being great defenders.
bulls00613::The Knicks are in a tough spot, if they lose to Bobcats tomorrow, everyone will know they tanked on purpose. They tried everything they could to tank tonight's game in the 4th, but the Clippers wouldn't take it.
Flyguys623 2.1::it would be sad if they tried. it would make them look pathetic
bulls00613::Yeah, you too!! Just funny how much disrespect the Bulls get. I guess if I was playing, I wouldnt want to face Lebron and Wade either. I mean you can't get a call.
Flyguys623 2.1::thats the reason. the bias in this league is ridiculous.
Flyguys623 2.1::probably, good luck if we play you
Xtreme Chaos1::Time for Milwaukee to clean some house...   We need to trade Jennings and get a pass first and solid defense point guard
Robert156877::I thought they were better before their last trade.  Maybe they are hoping to get lucky in the lottery.  This years draft is supposed to be very strong.
Flyguys623 2.1::THANK YOU KNICKERBOCKERS!! :)
bars over swag::stupid philly now u get wat u deserve f'n idiots
mrfireturkey::Excuses are for losers. You play who is in front of you even if they are a talented team like the Heat.
buckiturk03::So sorry guys I thought this was about the NBA game oops my bad. oh yea it is you dump fuc...,,.,ks it is who in god's green earth could give a rats as0000s about the fielderless soon to be braunless brewers or the freaking worse franchise in MLB history cubbies
spersack::"soon to be braunless" and in one sentence fragment you completely prove yourself to be an absolute blithering idiot.
bmorenevermore::Braun's signed through 2020.
DeerandBeer91:::(
DeerandBeer91::bucks are a big man away from the playoffs..
CheeseheadNation2011::I would rather we keep Ellis and trade Jennings hes a very up and down player one night he gives you 30 points and the next night he might give you 6 points
DeerandBeer91::i think he was just nervous and trying not to make mistakes with thr new team..i like ellis more too..i would like if the bucks traded jennings for al jefferson and a pick
CheeseheadNation2011::Just my opinion both are very good players but I dont think Ellis and Jennings will work out.
DeerandBeer91::i think they might trade one of them in the offseason..i wished it would of work out..they are fun to watch
mdfajs65::Seattle, Tampa, Vegas ... Breaking news all in the running for the Bucks when they leave in a year.
jakeschmeling::good riddance
buckspackers23::They aren't leaving in a year, Kohl is keeping the team for at least a few more years, in the talks with the Brewers owner to buy the team, as well as getting a new Arena, all of that assures that they Bucks aren't gone next year, dumbass.
Ryan59264::me?
buckspackers23::Yes it would, Kohl would give him a discount too. Look at all these bandwagon Bucks fans, when we had the 8 spot for a day, I saw this Ryan guy ecstatic, "The Bucks are soooo good".. look at him now.
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::I hope the Brewers owner buys them. That would be golden.
Ryan59264::As a resident of southeastern wisconsin i dont give a $@%!.
CheeseheadNation2011::F U C K the B E A R S, F U C K the C U B S but I have to admit the Bucks plain and simple SUCK.
jakeschmeling::yeah but they always do the same thing...spin the wheels and always hope for the eighth spot...which even if they get in they loose in 5 games...
buckspackers23::31-34 isn't terrible by any means.
DeerandBeer91::i agree about skiles
CheeseheadNation2011::I guess Im just frustruated with the bucks not putting out a good team on the floor I really think the Skyles has to go we need to try something new.
Ryan59264::Chicago fans, you dont really think the bulls are going to win the title do you?
DeerandBeer91::fenway and wrigly are dumps..history my $@%!!!!
jakeschmeling::and i forgot to mention the tripple A squad they have out on the field
jakeschmeling::wrigley is just terrible...how cubs fans enjoy a game there is beyond me...terrible concourses and no bathrooms plus a totally outdated scoreboard that doesn't look cool or historic at all
buckspackers23::I went to Wrigley last year, their bathrooms have piss dripping from the ceiling.  When Brewers fans are drunk, at least we can aim.
kudjer1::If you go simply by titles...  Packers &gt; Bears Brewers &lt; Cubs Bucks &lt; Bulls a non existent NHL team  &lt; Hawks
snow_brdr_88::Badgers &gt; Illini
buckspackers23::Packers fans don't talk about our titles in the 40's.. we talk about the ones in the last 20 years.
jakeschmeling::il give you the bulls because the bucks suck and who cares about hockey...but i dont consider over a 100 years of loosing to be a good franchise
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::A Chicago fan living in the past. What's new?
buckspackers23::^Long season of more losing.
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::For the Cubs, it's usually over by May.
kudjer1::since when did the season end at 25 games? long season buddy
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::I also bought up the fact that the Scrubs are currently in last place. Then you proceeded to bring up their WS Titles from before WWI.
kudjer1::you're point. you talk about the last Cubs title in 1908. isn't that the past hypocrite
buckspackers23::We had 11 blocks? wow.
DeerandBeer91::sanders went nuts!!
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtQYfpW_neE
jakeschmeling::the cubs roster right now consists of a subpar tripple A team...I just went to Wriggley slum and they have banners of Reed johnson!?!?!?!
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::Cubs fans sure talk a lot of trash for being in last place.
DeerandBeer91::Packers&gt;Bears Brewers&gt;Cubs Bulls&gt;Bucks All our college teams&gt;all Illinois college teams
kudjer1::what about your NHL team? hahahahah
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::How'd they do this year? Oh wait....
DeerandBeer91::6 national titles
buckspackers23::Honestly, I know a lot of people from Chicago, and go there a lot. Nobody was talking about the Blackhawks 3 years ago.  The Blackhawks have a bigger bandwagon than the Knicks and Heat combined.
kudjer1::4 stanley cups buddy
DeerandBeer91::Badgers Hockey&gt;Blackhawks
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::Our non existent NHL team won as many playoff series as the Crackhawks did.
buckspackers23::Guess who's the Big Market?   Chicago! And they're still terrible.
DeerandBeer91::that makes it 1000x better
kudjer1::How many World Series have the Brewers won......oh wait
jakeschmeling::shut up kudjer1...dont be mad cause the cubbies are $@%!$@%
kudjer1::Who cares if people still alive haven't witnessed it. No one alive has witnessed a Brewers title either.....shut up
kudjer1::someone started talking $@%! about the Cubs. i didnt start it
kudjer1::nope
buckspackers23::You're the one on a Bucks-Sixers board talking shit about the 2011 Division champ Brewers, when your Cubbies are god awful.
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::You mad bro?
buckspackers23::How many people that are alive now witnessed the Cubs last one...... oh wait.
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::Cubs have been around for 100+ years and have two.   Brewers have been around for 30.
kudjer1::numbers never lie  2 &gt; 0
buckspackers23::42 dude, but that is still dismal compared to 100+
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::Same difference. How does last place feel right now?
kudjer1::42 but who's counting
ansonyl25::76ers really want the Heat that bad??? lol
marat75::Bucks haven't played hard enough to clinch a playoff seed. Too bad.
buckspackers23::Dude is a Cubs fan, comes on here and talks shit about a near .500 team that just missed the playoffs, and is one of the most winning-est franchises in the NBA?   Sounds like a true Cubs fan.
kudjer1::Cubs 2 WS titles &gt; Brewers 0
buckspackers23::Is there anyone on the planet that was alive to witness that? There are many people that witnessed the Milwaukee Braves win, and the Seatle Pilots (Now the brewers) win.
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::True Cubs Fan = Stupid Cubs Fan
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::The Cubs. Hahahahahahaha
PHILLIES ARE WORLD CHAMPS 2012::Something tells me Vegas had something to do with this. No other explanation. Sixers are ABSOLUTE MORONS for winning this game!!! I hope they get swept by the Heat now. They deserve it!
bars over swag::stupid philly wat are u thinking winning this game
PHILLIES ARE WORLD CHAMPS 2012::Probably not now that they know they can have the Bulls, then the 4/5 seed, THEN the Heat.
sean407sean::dont matter philly will lose in 4 or 5  games first round regardless
tank_dogg06::A lot better chance against the Bulls who only won by single digits in the regular season meetings. Heat have owned them.
DaKing0325__::don't matter knicks will win
bars over swag::still couldve clinched the 8 seed with a loss
jamesbik::Shaun Livingston 33 mins....2 points....the D-league awaits your arrival next year Shaun
Thesith36::Thank you 76ers !!!
DaKing0325__::Is that turner or monta out there
kudjer1::21 turnovers. are you serious?
buckspackers23::100+ years. are you serious?
rdegaeta25::I'll tell you its amazing when this 76ers team shows up to play.  They can't beat some of the worst teams in the league on the road, but they can beat the Bucks....
soccerkewl37::shouldnt have gotten ellis doesnt fit there system with jennings
austin120020::They won a good amount of games with both playing actually
CheeseheadNation2011::I totally agree with you.
kudjer1::Bucks....lol
buckspackers23::Cubs....lol.
BucksPackersBrewersBadgers::"Dang Evan, stop shooting."  Kobe
buckspackers23::Evan Turner with 28 points on 29 shots. Melo's stat line right there.
tank_dogg06::He should be taking a shot every time he touches the ball. Collins is a good coach but he don't understand how to use Turner. He needs the ball in his hands. He's not an off-ball player.
3_ai_76::he knew he wasnt gonna get another chance, im glad he took so many shots. shouldve been like this all season.  hes the best player on the team but collins is just gonna give him even less minutes now cuz he scored too much
PHILAFANinVA::i don't know man.. ET barely took any free throws for majority of the game. melo would have 7 fieldgoals made  and 10+ ft and still end up with 28 points..
rham2826::bucks just cost me about 750 bucks unreal
PHILLIES ARE WORLD CHAMPS 2012::Not the Bucks fault. Sixers fault. They can't even lose correctly!!!
tdog3362::wow bucks lost
Thesith36::76ers win !! Wooooooooooooooooooooooo
VinniePSU::Sixers are unstoppable, I'm predicting a clean sweep thru the playoffs.......Turner comes out of nowhere to win finals MVP
PHILLIES ARE WORLD CHAMPS 2012::lol
buckspackers23::Dunleavy was wide open on the inbound, didn't pass to him, Dunleavy was open after Livingston drove in a bit, and he threw up a random shot.
