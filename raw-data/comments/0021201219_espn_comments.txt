M-K-G::<b> Last </b> Go Bobcats! Also goodbye espn boards.
xPrimex xFanx::al jefferson is not a bad player. he is a true center. he is going to help the bobcats rebound and scoring. our last great big man was emaka okafor , after he left we didnt  have any kind of front court. bismack is a good shot blocker but he does not have any kind of scoring presence but al jefferson has it. cody zeller is just a rookie and a old school type of player , its going to take cody zeller some years to get adjusted to the game and he is eventually going to be a all-star. now the bobcats need to sign gerald henderson back,  get some shooters in the free agent , im happy that the bobcats released bryon mullins , he is not better than josh mcroberts , josh mcroberts shot %0.455 in 67 games. Brian Mullins shot %0.385 in 53 games , thats a big difference. after bryon got injured  josh came in for him and he scored well and he rebound well. josh had alot of double double  games with the bobcats and he help us win some close games in the year

OSUKid81::Well, 21 wins.
Vampire013::Why did the Bobcats win just enough games to get out of the #1 pick?
ike9413::Draft class sucks this year and there isnt one GREAT player so it does not really matter. 1 and 2 will be close
Sir_Gunners::Don't worry, since there is no such thing as a "lottery". Stern will give the Cats the #1 pick, just like he did to the Hornets.
colszko1234::They fired Byron what idiots you give him 3 seasons and you fire him because injurys to the team wow what idiots
Not_You_Again::Jordan please go pick up a Center.  A true Center.  6'11 or better with an inside presence.  Kemba, MKG, Henderson and a true Center....Now that's the start of something beautiful.
Gerry4707::Lebron leaves the Cavs and they become a regular lottery team despite getting Kyrie Irving. Wow.....smh
Joe Raygor::13,000+ still showed up. Those are some true blue fans there.
malkit32::cleveland don t worry lebron will be back in 2014.. got pieces around him too then
9edr0::almost all the +/- comments got deleted lol
TCluvcarpanthers::Lmfaooooooooo, someone is mad.
9edr0::lol
9edr0::Byron Mullens has a +/- of -419   well +/- is sometimes right
TCluvcarpanthers::Desagna Diop has a +/- of -26 which means he's better than Rondo, +/- of -56.
9edr0::Diop is like the fat african version of Chuck Norris
TCluvcarpanthers::That's because Cousins sucks. +/- says so and it's always right.
9edr0::hmm better than DeMarcus Cousins
TCluvcarpanthers::Chuck Norris has a +/- of -201 though.
9edr0::Kevin Love has a +/- of +.1 per game
9edr0::https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=634&amp;q=pendergraph&amp;oq=pendergraph&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l3j0i5l3j0i24l4.174.3836.0.4699.11.10.0.1.1.0.329.912.8j1j0j1.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.9.img.HP6KDIsAe4Y#imgrc=3RLLKHQUY_wA0M%3A%3BTek6xlf1zofvXM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fblog.oregonlive.com%252Fbehindblazersbeat%252F2009%252F07%252Fmedium_pendergraph.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fblog.oregonlive.com%252Fbehindblazersbeat%252F2009%252F07%252Fpendergraph_a_unique_personali.html%3B240%3B187
9edr0::a pendergraph
9edr0::that smile has a +1000
9edr0::Jeff Pendergraph is a stud he has a +/- of 57!!! which is better than Dirk
9edr0::hmmm what witchcraft is this
9edr0::wtf is a pendergraph anyway?
TCluvcarpanthers::That dude killed us when we played Indiana lol.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::Lol.  I always thought his surname was Pendergram.
Denis2224::Otto Porter to Cleveland.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::Asik is owning Howard so far....
9edr0::his +/- is going way down
TCluvcarpanthers::Because his +/- is better.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::Your +/- just went up by +1 for that comment.
TCluvcarpanthers::It's +212.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::LMAO!
Denis2224::Charlotte also needs to pick Noel to ensure that they suck for another year so they can get Andrew Wiggins in 2014 lol
9edr0::Pablo Prigioni is better than David Lee +/- said so
9edr0::he is also better than Kobe "Brick" Bryant
TCluvcarpanthers::First team in NBA history whose win total tripled from the previous season!
Denis2224::Charlotte really needs to sign a solid big man this offseason. Someone like Paul Milsap.
jack_the_baller::they should make a 30 for 30 on this comeback to get us out of last place what a inspiration
TCluvcarpanthers::Lol, where'd that clown go?
9edr0::his +/- is like -1000
9edr0::yea probably
TCluvcarpanthers::It's probably worse than Kemba's.
9edr0::Tiago Splitter has a better +/- than Carmelo so Splitter is better than Carmelo "Marshmallow" Anthony
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::You pretty much shut him down.  Lol.  OWNED!
TCluvcarpanthers::I guess Kevin Durant is the MVP because he has a +/- of +538 compared to Lebron's +/- of +482.
9edr0::Mario Chalmers is a superstar +/- of + 569....Wade's is just +571
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::To the cordial Cavs fans, good luck next year.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::Same to you guys! I will be rooting for you guys!  :)  GO CAVS!!!
Kujosh54321::Have a great off season everyone.  Go Bobcats!
TCluvcarpanthers::You too!
TCluvcarpanthers::Hey everyone, Thabo Sefelosha &gt; Tony Parker, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Blake Griffin, Paul George, D Wade, Dirk, Manu, Tyson Chandler, Andre Igoudala, Ty Lawson, Kobe Bryant because he has a better +/-.
9edr0::that is so true
9edr0::heck Irving blows +/- of -181
9edr0::Jeff Taylor +/- is -177 so Taylor &gt; Irving
TCluvcarpanthers::Let's not forget the immortal Steve Novak with a +/- of +177
TCluvcarpanthers::And how about ya boy Udonis Haslem with a monster +/- of +200
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Lol @ all the butt hurt Cavs fans.  We tripled our win total from last year. We want to win! Screw the #1 pick. First if all, if Noel is your clear cut top pick, then that means its nothing to fret about. Second, if that lottery were worth a damn, Anthony Davis would be a Bobcat. Third, why in the hell are you running your mouths anyway? We don't have superstar Kyrie. We don't have the great Tristan Thompson. We never had an Andy V. Still BARELY behind you with a ton of cap space and draft picks coming up. And these are value picks. It's a new day in Charlotte. Get ready for the Hornets takeover clowns.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::You need to be bad to win later.  Both of the teams are young.  The Cavs have had a lot injuries this year and they are young so the defensive isn't there.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::No Cleveland fan ever said anything about the Bobcats.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::Those aren't Cleveland fans.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Scroll down.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::What butt hurt Cavs fans are you talking about?
9edr0::Demarcus Cousins sucks +/- of -301
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::LMAO!  Nice rebounding LA!  LOL!
TCluvcarpanthers::Carlos Delfino is a beast; he has a +/- of +199.
9edr0::Kendrick Perkins has a +/- of +323 he is a stud
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::+/- is for defensive minded players, what PER is for offensive minded players.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::Well +/- helps defensive players look better than PER does.  They shut down the opposition(no true NBA centers also), and they take high % shots.
9edr0::oh yea man he is lockdown
TCluvcarpanthers::Because Boris Diaw is a defensive juggernaut...
9edr0::Borris Diaw is a stud also +/- of + 225....so it Koufos at +209
joah5454_3::Bobcats are the 2nd worst team in the league.  Rejoice Charlotte!
CLTBraves12::Welcome to the Charlotte Hornets off-season board.
zeller9523::*Pelicans*
zeller9523::2011-2012: Kemba Walker worst +/- in the nba 2012-2013: Kemba Walker 6th worst +/- in the nba  Ya real good player......
9edr0::and he is a  smallish PG and PG's aren't exactly defensive stoppers
zeller9523::http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/12040/plusminus-is-not-the-devil
TCluvcarpanthers::You're more of a joke than Henry Abbott.
zeller9523::what? I had a period at the end so i took it out. is that ok with you. Read that article you idiot
9edr0::Henry Abbott doesn't know anything
TCluvcarpanthers::Lolool, the edit button is great, isn't it?
9edr0::thats because the rest of the team sucks lol
TCluvcarpanthers::The simple fact that you used +/- to judge a player's value shows how little you know about basketball.
joah5454_3::Both stats are worthless
TCluvcarpanthers::I'd use PER over +/- lol.
TCluvcarpanthers::No, it's just a plain ol' useless stat.
zeller9523::Over a few games ya its a useless stat. But if you look at it over a full season of basketball its has value. And the fact that walker has been the 7th worst in the entire nba for 2 years in a row is embarrassing
JohnsonnnL::Oladipo is like a bigger more athletic version of Avery Bradley.
TCluvcarpanthers::He's no where near as disruptive defensively as Avery Bradley.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::I agree.  There really is no doubt in my mind he will be a great young prospect.
JohnsonnnL::He can be better than Bradley there's a reason hes a projected top 5 pick.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::Not now of course.  He has everything Bradley has.  He can be just as good.
JohnsonnnL::go back and watch his game against Michigan state
TCluvcarpanthers::He's just not on Avery Bradley's level yet. He's yet to face any NBA players, like D Wade, Monta Ellis, Russell Westbrook, and Joe Johnson, that Bradley has succesfully limited.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgWJGiJJAwk  Just look at the film.  You see that ability to get around screen.  His feet placement.  Hands and athleticism.  He is very good defensively.
-Lelouch vi Britannia-::I like that comparison on the defensive side of the ball...  Oladipo can be better offensively.  He takes a lot of smart shots and he crushes on the offensive board.  He has that Anderson Varejao box out IQ.
