Mister E::Larry Sanders was one turnover away from a perfect game.
MichaelM::Why are the Jazz starting 2 veteran forwards that stink?
Fort Apache::If I were a star of either of these teams, I would guarantee a loss by fouling out as fast as I could to help my team make the lottery.
Rebecca::The Jazz will take it to the Bucks tonight and win by 25 points. The Bucks will win the number one draft pick and the Jazz will be luck to get pick number 14, because the Jazz have the pieces to win this year. However, I wish I were the Bucks because of the talented players that will be available for the draft this year. In two years the Bucks will be in playoff contention again.
El Jefe MN::Move along....move along.  Nothing to see here.
clint::everybody beats the Bucks except the Lakers?
Cyril::"Hey Khris Middleton, thanks for leading us in scoring for a few games.  Now if you don't mind, I'm going to bench you for Luke Ridnour.  No offense; I'm just weird like that."   -Larry Drew
Fort Apache::Two teams trying to out-tank each other. Are they going to slow dance? Should be an amusing match-up. This should be on NBA-TV.
WILDMANJAY::#$%$ bucks. go from winning in LA to losing in Utah. this season is sick. can we just call the season off now for the bucks.and forfit the rest of the season.
sidney c::Why. Start Marvin over kanter.
