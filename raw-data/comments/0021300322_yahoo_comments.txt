lbirdfan33::Minnesota might be the third best team in the East...
PKM::A big 1st quarter lead is a great time to make a live wager on a team in the NBA.  You probably could have gotten at least 8-1 on the wolves.
jailere::Hummel bailed them out a good bunch tonight.  Nice to see a bench player contribute in the scoring column.
cheeez::It's a good thing Rick is utilizing his bench more. No starter has played more than 40 minutes tonight, but maybe he should speed up the development of Dieng. That guy is a beast in defense.
Duaine Dewey::The Wolves will never be worth a Damn until they shed themselves of Addelman. He holds the young guys back and can't coach the vets. Its no wonder he can't keep a job. Makes me think about how he hurt Williams progress, will he do that to Muhammad and Dieng to. What a loser of a coach
Dan::Wolves gonna punk the 76ers tonight and clown the overrated Eagles on Sunday.   Minnesota!
PKM::Philly and Minnesota, sounds cold.
Alfren::finally the wolves bench are doing something...
Commenter::Kevin Love (R) current speaker of the crib
Words R Weapons::corey brewer is having a nice game today.0 points
