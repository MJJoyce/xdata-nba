hookemzuniga1022::Cardinals-Sun Devils-Diamondbacks-SunsAs many of you know,I have posted the message"Spurs fans suck." many times. So why do I hate the Spurs? Because my Phoenix Suns got SCREWED in 2007. That Amare suspension was totally unfair and unwarranted and it cost the Suns the key game of that series,game 5. It was totally unfair and unwarranted and it may well have cost the Suns the 2007 NBA Championship. After the tragedy of 2007,being a Suns fan gives me no choice but to hate the Spurs.---------  Actually The Utah Jazz would have played you guys in the WCF and they beat you guys 3-1 in the season seires. Boozer, Millsap were at the best of their careers. And so was deron Williams. Its likely the suns would have lost to Utah
jf20219::Best record in the league baby go Spurs go!
YeahTerps420::You can't stop Matt Bonner you can only hope to contain him.
Hondo Kid::Go Spurs.

manoocena::who asked for an explanation? who cares some butt-hurt phoenix fan doesn't like the Spurs?
sdfdfgdfg1700::and liking your own post is like high fiving yourself in public when no one else does

sdfdfgdfg1700::and that suspenison was given by the nba...so shouldn't you be pissed at the nba? last time i checked, the spurs dont give out suspensions
lmata1981::But didn't your Suns sweep the Spurs in 2010? Doesn't that give you any satisfaction? They had their chance in 2010 to win a championship but couldn't get past the Lakers.
VolkieG::Anyone know when Duncan and Pops will return to the team?
CubanSucksRiverWater::I'd expect the next home game on the 30th.
lmata1981::Spurs play the Bobcats on Wednesday. They will keep Duncan out on that one. I'd keep him out until the RRT.
No-account drifter::Nothing funnier than Stern/ABC-ESPN thinking today's two network TV matchups would be great games. Now, Lakers-Celtics in the JV warm-up to Thunder-Heat ... But maybe they were savvy enough to know we'd love watching the Thunder demolish and plunder the Lakers.
Arbyrick::Maybe our new coach will get us playing just well enough to miss out on the lottery again......
blackdevilace::Do the Spurs fear Okie City?
Vaquero In The House::Respect?  Respect is earned.  If the Thunder ever acquire as many or more NBA Championship banners to hang from their rafters than the Spurs, then there will be mutual respect, in the mean time the Thunder are just another team on the Spurs schedule.  Fear?  The only fear the Spurs have is Coach Pop, just ask the Heat!!     Go Spurs Go!!
BGSSGB::Without harden last season they wouldn't have won. They got players who can step up though so we gotta see if they can do it consistently through a 7 game series
manoocena::not without Harden, I fully expect for WestBrick to win us that series.
CubanSucksRiverWater::Spurs RESPECT OKC.  At the same time, they will hope that OKC won't shoot quite as lights out as they did when they back door swept the Spurs in the playoffs last year.  The improved play of Splitter (now that Pop is finally playing him) gives the Spurs some much needed depth to help TD down low.   Leonard is playing some good D and the whole team is doing much better defensively than last season.  Once the upcoming rodeo road trip is out of the way, SA will have the rest of the season to (relatively) rest up at home and prepare for the playoffs.    And as SA saw last year, cooltapes, getting game 1+game 2 doesn't assure a win.
No-account drifter::Spurs aren't a "fear" kind of team. If they were, they would.
cooltapes777::they at least respect the hell out of them. likely a battle royale WCF
cooltapes777::yes and no. Get game 1, then get game 2, and the answer is no.
TlanImass::Shannon Brown is a bum.

polocash::I'm out .. always good to see whitey blasting Spurs especially after the Spurs beat the Suns.
TRUUU_SPURZ::Later,cash Im out too see ya Kirt.
kirt02::later
kirt02::.
polocash::Nash's acting job got his own players to leave bench and get suspended. If he just gets up, maybe the past would be different, but maybe not also. How did the Spurs know the Suns would leave the bench? Maybe they knew they were not an experienced team. Maybe the Spurs were a little smarter than an average bear.
TRUUU_SPURZ::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZdik09RGJI&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player To me this is Horry's greatest performance ever,I had to change my pants at least 3 times.lol
Hondo Kid::Man that takes me back.  That series was one of the best ever.  If u look close horry never breaks a sweat.  Thanks for link.  Very cool.  Go spurs
TRUUU_SPURZ::Haha...now that a&amp;m is in the sec i root for yall
TRUUU_SPURZ::That was a great year 2005 Longhorns and Spurs
kirt02::yeah, yeah, longhorns, i rooted for the horns once, in 2005... i still remember a fumbled punt in college station recovered by a&amp;m, given to t.u., but that's alright
kirt02::awesome
Egr_Troll_Nation_1.4::An impeccable record of 16-0 at home...o yea!
TRUUU_SPURZ::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pBeCQak588&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

kirt02::lol, and nash invented the flop, imo
mdupnic09::i like the title better but same thing  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhXNhDmW86o
cheesemanrules::I was at that game.  Spurs did lose that game.
Egr_Troll_Nation_1.4::Goooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!! Spurs!!!!! Goooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!
Cardinals-Sun Devils-Diamondbacks-Suns::2004 "They get it to Fisher. He scores! Derek Fisher scores at the buzzer!" :)
CubanSucksRiverWater::LOL 2004.  How about this year's Faker team?
Nerissa2525::Unlike you spurs moved on
Awakenbeing::Kill it...
Nerissa2525::See a doctor dude
polocash::Now he's a Laker fan.
cheesemanrules::9 years ago md.  2004 Western Conference Semis.  At least he could have referred back to the 1993 WC Semis when Barkley hit a shot over the Admiral in the last game played at Hemisfair Arena.
cheesemanrules::Pathetic trolling when you have to refer to another team betting the Spurs other than your team.
mdupnic09::from what was it 10+ years ago (yes it still haunts me)
kirt02::and how long ago?
cheesemanrules::beating.  my apologies
kirt02::what's up, MILKY
Egr_Troll_Nation_1.4::Do you take medication?
Egr_Troll_Nation_1.4::He might need a brain transplant....but who knows...the brain might reject him
howdytharrr::hopefully some sunscreen
kirt02::.
LEBRON OWNS ALL::You are all witnesses.
polocash::I was a witness when MJ won 6 in a row, in the years he played.
cheesemanrules::Go troll somewhere else if you can't take the HEAT....get it..Pun intended.
mdupnic09::kobe has a comercial too, hows that working out
cheesemanrules::You are witless.
kirt02::nice.... better than my comeback
LEBRON OWNS ALL::That was rude.
kirt02::.
Nerissa2525::Okc
No-account drifter::Nuggets. Makes more sense geographically for me, but Admiral and then Duncan have kept me hooked on the Spurs regardless of where I've lived. Nuggets are fun to watch in an entirely different way.
Spurcase42::Houston or Dallas. If there were no Spurs, I would have no reason to hate either of them, so I would go for a Texas team. It would be hard to get my heart broken so often though.
kirt02::yeah, that's why i said houston, but i like small OKC too.  Dallas with cuban is a no go for me though
spurs_4_5::okc.. designed after spurs
Teo240::pacers
polocash::Might root for Suns so Whitey can live in peace... lol NOT
polocash::And anyone who plays the top 6 from last year.
polocash::Would have to find a good reason to like someone, usually pick an underdog.. Beats jumping on a wagon.
cheesemanrules::Probably Golden State
kirt02::.
mdupnic09::i was torn between the bulls and okc, possibly pacers because of hill
polocash::Would go where Duncan or Parker went.
kirt02::.
LEBRON OWNS ALL::Miami obviously. We are all witnesses.
mdupnic09::defiantly no on that one
kirt02::.
mdupnic09::tough question cant make up my mind
polocash::What we know so far.. Spurs are Hot.. Clips are on slide, Heat are cold.. Laker's are done...  oh and Whitey will never realize his team broke a very clear rule in the NBA by having players leave bench during a fight..
Egr_Troll_Nation_1.4::What's the difference between the Phoenix Suns and a dollar bill? You can still get four quarters out of a dollar bill....the suns played good through three and a half....haha
LEBRON OWNS ALL::You Spurs fans are just mad because you can't win in the playoffs anymore. Who cares if you win 50+ every year when you don't even make it to the finals anymore lmao.
CubanSucksRiverWater::Which is why LeBronze had to chase a ring
Nerissa2525::Spurs always play their best win or lose unlike Lebron who quits during playoff
Spurcase42::The Spurs fans have never been embarrassed to have the Spurs as their team, not since Timmy came. to SA. In their worst seasons, they at least made the playoffs and in their best they won the championshiops. Four of them Only 3 other teams can say that. And there are a lot of teams whose teams have always lost in the playoffs. Are you bashing them? Or is it just the Spurs?
bballfan6767::Lol I guess we will see won't we?
bballfan6767::How mad is that old Suns fan who always comes on and complains about 07 lol. He must want to win all these games so bad lol
Nerissa2525::Always looking forward to his post heheh
TRUUU_SPURZ::Spurs &gt; Pre Heat
incredibeau::Top Post Season Win % in NBA (Spurs... all about the "regular" season ) 1. Manu  - .702 2. Parker - .695 3. Duncan - .694 9. LeBron - .623
Spurcase42::Well, among those three Spurs players, Timmy has four championships, Tony and Manu have 3. Not a bad average.
TheBrownestBob::"Steph Curry is better than Tony Parker"  - average meth addict
Alredy81::i literally laughed out loud
Nerissa2525::lol funny
Egr_Troll_Nation_1.4::Everytime I see albino's avatar....I have to wear my shades...oh so bright!
LEBRON OWNS ALL::The Spurs are front runners that can't win a title anymore.
SpursFanStuckinHouston::Keep playing in the Leastern Conference where you can coast through the whole season
Egr_Troll_Nation_1.4::Shut up kid....the Spurs are playing better then the low heat.
polocash::Spurs 2nd string  = heat in 47 minutes
TRUUU_SPURZ::Spurs &gt; heat
mdupnic09::spurs &gt; heat
Egr_Troll_Nation_1.4::Where's slam dork at? I see albino pale dude is in here!
Nerissa2525::That Imp change his name I think hahaha
polocash::nah.. whitey is always on the Spurs boards.. Not much to root for in PHX, so he likes to hate on Spurs.
polocash::Praying for a Suns win over Spurs would make his day
mdupnic09::i think we found a replacement   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
LEBRON OWNS ALL::The Spurs care about the regular season.. The Heat care about the post season.
Spurcase42::Yeah, the Spurs only care about the regular season. That is why they have been in the WCF two times since their last championship in 207.
arizonasportsman::Rolling eyes here.
polocash::That's why the Spurs sent their starters home and Miami played theirs ... Come back after you have more bb IQ.
kirt02::^^^^^^^^^^
mdupnic09::so thats why pop sent everyone home against the heat...its all clear now
kirt02::^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
kirt02::you drunk?
Cowboys N Spurs Dynasty::and that's why the Spurs have 4 titles and the Heat have only 2
TRUUU_SPURZ::Dont sleep on the Pacers,If Danny Granger ever gets healthy.
No-account drifter::They'll clone Joey Crawford before they'll let that happen.
TRUUU_SPURZ::David Stern's worse nightmare Spurs vs Pacers lol
alienboy51::Hmmm...think his nightmare is spurs vs. anyone...
Cardinals-Sun Devils-Diamondbacks-Suns::As many of you know,I have posted the message"Spurs fans suck." many times. So why do I hate the Spurs? Because my Phoenix Suns got SCREWED in 2007.

It was totally unfair and unwarranted and it may well have cost the Suns the 2007 NBA Championship. After the tragedy of 2007,being a Suns fan gives me no choice but to hate the Spurs.
Spurcase42::The key game? I would have thought game 6 was the key game. the Spurs were only up 3-2 at that time The Suns had a full team in three of the four games the Spurs won,. An yet they try to convince us that if they had only won game 5 they would have won the series.    A championship team does not fold because they lose one game. They were leading the Spurs in game 5 and folded. The truth was the Spurs were just the better team.   I will even admit the Spurs pulled the same thing in 2994.Some Spurs fans will tell you if the Lakers had not made the .04 shot, the Spurs would have won the series. Maybe. But they were only down 3-3 and could have still come back and won, but they didn't. They folded just like the Suns did in 2007.  Detroit did not fold when they lost game 5 to the Spurs. They came back. won game 6, and made a game of it in game 7. They played like champions and came up just short. The Suns played like chumps and left a whole game on the table. Don't tell me the Suns were screwed. They just lost.   Oh, and remember that the Spurs were without Horry in games 5 and 6. And while he was not a starter, he was one of the top bench players and the Spurs top three point shooter. He was also a closer, a guy you had on the court at the end of a close game. Think game 5 in Detroit in 2005. So quit crying about 2007. You lost fair and square. If you want to hate on someone for game 5, hate on Diaw and Amare, they are the ones who let you down. Time you hold the correct people accountable.
Spurcase42::Nash flopped. He admitted it.
spurs_4_5::wonder what diaw would say now about that
jf20219::Once again this gets you no where, you should look up the word insanity sometime
polocash::they break a clear rule and think they should not pay consequences...
kirt02::holy crap... you save this comment in MS word and post after every game?  you are a psychopath
incredibeau::that sucks man
polocash::copy paste much????????? and you are the only one liking this old crap
kirt02::.
Texans Nation. WE SOLUTE NO. 99::Spurs V. Knicks in the finals.  Spurs in 6!
LEBRON OWNS ALL::Rofl the Spurs and Knicks won't be there.
mdupnic09::still waiting...
LEBRON OWNS ALL::lmao you people are clowns
Cowboys N Spurs Dynasty::Knicks are better than the heat. You mad?
mdupnic09::whats the knicks record against miami this year? feel free to include the scores
kirt02::sounds like a chant... spurs over knicks in six
polocash::The Spurs have made the playoffs in 21 of the last 22 seasons, and have not missed the playoffs in the 15 seasons since Tim Duncan was drafted by the Spurs in 1997. With their 50th win in the 2011-2012 season, the Spurs currently hold the record for most consecutive 50+ win seasons at 13. About to be 14 soon.  This is dominance!!
polocash::LeChoke can't match this.
TRUUU_SPURZ::Spurs have only missed the playoffs 4times in 40 years.
Cowboys N Spurs Dynasty::Yup 1 of the best in all sports
kirt02::.
kirt02::.
No-account drifter::Higher percentage - from playing fewer games.
mdupnic09::i think its by win percentage but yeah its happened a few time this season and i thought the same thing
mdupnic09::last time i saw it it actually had us at -.5 game behind and okc at zero. that really threw me off
kirt02::.
TRUUU_SPURZ:::(
arizonasportsman::Not a good night for the Lakers at all:  Portland won. Utah won. Houston won.
jf20219::After Lakers finally get a win yesterday lol then getting another L tomorrow
Cowboys N Spurs Dynasty::Why are we talking about an irrelevant team like the Lakers lol
mdupnic09::so good night for everyone else
kirt02::poor clips lost 4th straight
Cardinals-Sun Devils-Diamondbacks-Suns::With the way the Clippers are fading,it almost seems inevitible that the Thunder will win the west again this year.
Cardinals-Sun Devils-Diamondbacks-Suns::But let's see what happens when CP3 comes back,maybe they'll regain their steam.
mdupnic09::its always been okc v. sa this year
No-account drifter::seriously choked.
jf20219::No cp3 and a close game
mdupnic09::choked the game away too haha
