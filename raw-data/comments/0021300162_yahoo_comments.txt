doomshades::Pretty interesting assists stat line by the Wizards starters.
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot::Having been a Cavs fan since Austin Carr played for them, I am watching this game. It's 23-11 Washington. Cleveland ... your best bet is to tank two more years.  Whoops ... 25-11.  Anyway .... tank two more years, get two more lotto picks ... and then you might have something!
Lawrence::Between Clark, Gee and Bennett, the three scored 3 points. Send them to the D league, trade them or release them. Zeller was inactive,wise decision. Brown needs to be fired tomorrow. The Cavs are not going to regroup under his style to salvage this season.A long losing stretch started tonight with a loss to Washington.
C K::Mike Brown can't coach, LeBron made him look good.
Skot::73 - 48? what the heck!!! HORRIBLE!  Are they playing at home?
Commenter::I smell lottery again
Larry::Can any one say Mike Brown offense!
Cyril::The Cavs' best draft pick hasn't even played a minute yet this year.  I'm talking about Carrick Felix! As far as I know, he isn't injured.  Why keep Alonzo Gee on the active list when Felix could at least get some garbage minutes.
Caveman::Only the Wiz can blow a 27pt lead. Uncle Drew is putting it down
Tony Anthony::If John Wall can hit his jump shots like last year, the Wizards will have a much better record. He needs to shake off his shooting slump.
