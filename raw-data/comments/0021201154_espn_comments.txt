Larry Schieferstein::worse refereeing ive seen..makes u wonder how rigged this stupid game is. i mean watch the replay of the charge call..and livingstons foul late in the 4th to tie the game???!! didnt even touch the guy..i give up on the cavs and the game...no need to watch people..congrats too the heat.
MontelGolfer::I was hoping last night to the E henry would kick MWP in that healed knee
MontelGolfer::Biggest choke job since the Houston Oilers losing to Buffalo Bills in playoff game back in 90's
ptglj517::there was no mention in the article of overcoming a 20 point deficit with under 9 minutes left.  I find that remarkable even if it was against the lowly cavs
zsmitson2012::i recorded the game last night, watched until 3rd when cavs got up by 20. about turned it off but instead decided to ff it to 6min left in 4th, just to see how close we got. it was single digits then, announcers saying we were on a run.  man I love the pacers! that was awesome
BGSURugby::skcus
BGSURugby::npse
pacersfj20::How Brian Shaw is still the Associate Head coach is beyond my comprehension, but I would love if teams were stupid and didn't hire him again this year.  The guy can coach, and I have been calling for more PT for Pendergraph all year.  Team and typically the bench play better when he is in the game then they do when Tyler is in the game.
ptglj517::tyler has been playing pretty well though, especially while west was out there for a bit.  i'd still like to see pendergraph in the regular rotation for 10-15 mins a game though
doggbrown1::cavs suck
IUPUIJags10::Where was Roy in the second half? He didn't really play at all after pushing around Zeller in the first half. He did struggle with that mid-range J of Zeller's but that's the shot you want them to take. Our rebounding took a big hit when he wasn't in the game.
Balticplayer::Nah I just watched the 4 quarter. And there were some questionable calls down the stretch. Irving was fouled when he scored to 92:88. Should had been an and one. And the last call against Irving was close but should had been an and one too. Not a charge. So Indiana got lucky on this one. But I think Cleveland can live with the L cause of the lottery chances.
IUPUIJags10::I was at the game ace and that last call was most certainly a charge. Pendergraph clearly established his feet outside of the restricted zone. There was a lot of calls that could've gone either ways including a lot of touch fouls like the one you mentioned. That's todays NBA, you can't blame the refs for every loss. There were several layups that the Cavs missed in the 4th that could have shifted the outcome.
Balticplayer::Tanking per excellence by the Cavs. Nice job.
ranmarsage::Must be nice to be a Pacers or Cavaliers fan, pretty much you hardly see any trolls, like the Heat or Lakers board.
Btownguy0405::except for knicks fans... seriously at least have a team better than us before you troll us.
jimkamlowsky::There should be an inquest into this game. Shady doings on the part of the Cavs.
dorucevic::Pacers suck from the three, last two games they are 9 of 57 and looking at the knicks just last game 20 of 36.they need to trade with new york for one of those dudes
Taco has a Q::Live by the 3, die by the 3 which is why NY will go down
IUPUIJags10::Amen, the 3 ball was dropping for them at the beginning of the season and they're dropping now. But are we the only ones who remember that stretch in the middle of the season where they were terrible?
Taco has a Q::Even as a 3 seed we still avoid the Heat if the Knicks make it to the 2nd round right?   seeds 4-7 would see the Heat then right?
Mcfly_2015::yes. can we beat NY w/o home court?
Taco has a Q::I think so
Taco has a Q::Look what I saw on the Bulls thread!!  geeman217  Rasta Masta 33 - Pacers are pretty damn good dude, and I hate to admit it too  ____________________  Not really... they're the doofus in the middle, a little West and George.    stop George,   Noah always does well on the doofus you got yourself a ball game home or road.
Mcfly_2015::Indy outscored the Cavs 36-14 after Vogel was ejected
Mcfly_2015::4,382-2*
Mcfly_2015::wait WTF??? i turned it off when it was 86-66 with 10 minutes left. indy came back?!
heitz13::I did the same and went to bed.
ptglj517::sure did!
01.02.2013::what the heck was kylie doing in the 4th was he injured?
wrecko22::26-27-31-   10!!   yeah right  sure
wrecko22::think that 4th quarter (10 points yeah right) had anything to do with the Cleveland +9000
qandrews94::Pacers Moneyline was like -2000 but your right Brooklyn/Cavs fans, the refs definitely fixed this game. SMH.
Larry Schieferstein::dude his foot was over the restricted zone. fix your eyes
IUPUIJags10::I was at the game and the refs did not fix it. There were several layups from point blank range that the Cavs missed in the forth quarter. That charge on Pendergraph, it was clear that he established his feet outside the restricted zone.
wrecko22::agree 100%  10 points in the 4th  yeah right  missing point blank baskets under the rim constantly with 3 minutes left
DORES22::Clevland had to throw this game in the 4th to not get the win and still have the shot at 1st overall pick
masterjoe712::I feel that Vogel ejection is being sensationalized all it really did was put Brian Shaw in position to play Jeff Pendergraph who did a much better job defending the pick and roll. I mean hell he was + 23 in only 8 minutes played because of his ability to defend the pick and roll which allowed for the wings to be much more aggressive on D.
Frank Vogel Is My Hero::I was at the game, and you're exactly right. Pendergraph's stat line will never show his defensive presence. Aside from Hibbert, he is our best under-basket defender. He plays straight up. Plus, he's quick enough to cut off the passing lanes. Something Hibbert struggles with.
JollySwagman27::Shaw won't be working for Vogel next year, he'll have his own team, possibly in Cleveland.
masterjoe712::Kind of a shame, I really feel like he is important to the development for players on the team like Paul George. Shaw does deserve a chance as a head coach though, but not sure how many enticing options are going to be out there.
Yata-garasu::I don't think Scott is leaving.  It really isn't his fault the team is struggling.  They are very young and it takes time.  If the Cavs are bad next year than they should let him go as he will have no excuse not to make the playoffs with Irving/Waiters/Top 5 pick+top 15 pick(LA hopefully)/Thompson/Varejao and an actual bench.
Yata-garasu::God the Lakers are pathetic....  Struggling with the Hornets...
jeffry31::35-10 4TH Q   WOW
Rcrown10::maybe he's 31 yrs old. maybe thats his favorite number or maybe thats how many foul shots .... Lol.
Area55andG2::REG-GIE REGGIE REGGIE REGGIE
Rcrown10::hhahaa.
Area55andG2::Why do you have 31 in your username?
Rcrown10::im a CLE fan, didnt watch the game was out golfing today, but what in the world happened? obviously i seen the final score and Pacers won, im not upset i dont care if the Cavs lose out rest of season for Lottery Pick, but there was a ton like a whole lot of people talking about the refs? did Pacers shoot over 40foul shots and Cavs like 10?
Rcrown10::oh wow Indiana shot not 10, or 20 but ... 30 more foul shots ! thats a ton. : /
Yata-garasu::Indiana can beat Miami but they will all be low scoring games.  The only way the Knicks win is if they shoot 50+% from 3 the whole series and bring back the 2009 Orlando Magic karma on James.
JollySwagman27::@Rcrown : entire NBA.  They are barely #2 in scoring defense, they were #1 4 or 5 games ago but Memphis and Indiana have been 1/2 all year.  and to clarify they aren't the best 3-pt shooting team, they allow the lowest opposing 3-pt %.
Area55andG2::Granger's out for the season. He had surgery like 2 weeks ago on the same knee again.
Rcrown10::the pacers are #2 in scoring defense, #1 in opposing FG%, 3pt FG%, and rebounding...... Wow. is that in the East or all of NBA? im hoping they can bring that into the Playoffs and be physical with Miami like that. I think if so they could maybe win? Also does anyone know if Danny Granger is going to play anytime soon?
Area55andG2::Cleveland had very little resistance to any penetration from the top of the key and from the post on defense. The Pacers did this process non-stop.
JollySwagman27::it's because indiana has dominant bigs.  that's also why the pacers are #2 in scoring defense, #1 in opposing FG%, 3pt FG%, and rebounding.  Pacers get to the line because they have better big men than most teams.  This game was no exception.
YogaBeer::there was a spot in the 4th Q where 5 minutes went by with no whistles blown for either team.    And it was physical.    Then all of a sudden, Livingston gets his 6th foul while not touching a player  (that play changed the outcome of the game).     IN the final 12 seconds, Kyrie drives to the basket, makes it and is expecting the "and one".    However, the refs can't decide on the floor if the defender was in the restricted area (not to mention the trailing guard that pushed Kyrie in the back.) whether or not his foot was inside the Restricted area.   The call went to the Pacers.
Area55andG2::the foul on Livingston was awful. The offensive foul was legitimate. Your announcers thought it was apparently illegal to have the heal hover over the line, but that isn't the case.
JollySwagman27::and you've continued to whine like a child about it for the last hour.  get over it.
Rcrown10::thanks Yoga. and yea ... people were commenting like im not even a Pacers or Cavs fan but this game was fixed or terribly terribly refereed.
JollySwagman27::the cavs were shooting well over 50% until the 4th.  they went ice cold and the pacers did the opposite.
Rcrown10::rebounds were just about the same. same with assists. Cavs did turn the ball over 8 more times. Shooting % though the Cavs shot 46% while Pacers just at 40%
Area55andG2::pretty much the case. The Pacers are almost always the victims of poor reffing, this game was an odd ball
JollySwagman27::a bunch of idiots complain about a rigged game.  a few calls here and there were questionable but, the pacers just flat out shut them down in the 4th and started hitting shots they missed the first 3 quarters.  look at the box score and focus on the turnovers, rebounds, steals, and fast break points.
John 3663::Pacers were down 20 and came back late in the fourth quarter. However there were a number of questionable fouls throughout
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::Welcome to the NBA
YogaBeer::At the top of the page, there's a link to verify that.
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::Pacers most likely win 2 or 3 of the final 4 games?  Get the 3 seed and play Chicago or Atlanta in the 1st round?
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::This is not the same deal.  The Pacers would rather face New York than Miami if they reach the 2nd round.  How is that hard to understand?
YogaBeer::No disrespect intended, but I honestly thought the Cavs would win this one just b/c I thought the Pacers would be resting some of their players.
ptglj517::BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated - To avoid the 4 seed if Brooklyn passes them.  As a division winner, Pacers have the 3 clinched don't they?  or is that not accurate with respect to the NBA's rules?  I thought the seed was clinched but if in the 2nd round they faced a worse seed with a better record, then the team with the better record still gets homecourt.  ----------  checked on it, the three division winners + team with next best record are seeded 1-4.  pacers would have to tank but the nets own the tiebreaker and we play them again still.  we better not pack it in too early; this comeback win was big.
YogaBeer::Not a big deal.    Just glad I don't bet or I'd be kicking the dog tonight.
YogaBeer::so it's just chest thumping over 3 or 4 spot.    I could see keeping them in if it were some kind of Pacer record for wins, or a player was nearing some milestone or if there were a particular match-up.  In other words, the complete opposite of 2007 when Manning (and others) sit out and lose the last game.    The game really didn't matter other than other teams that were trying to make the playoffs.
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::To avoid the 4 seed if Brooklyn passes them.
YogaBeer::Then why are the Pacers not resting their players for the playoffs?
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::Not really.  Teams 2-7 are actually really close this year in my opinion.  Could see anyone from the Pacers to Boston reaching the ECF with Miami.
YogaBeer::Is there a team you're trying to avoid?    Besides the HEat.
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::Pacers just need to win 2 more games to secure the 3 seed over Brooklyn.  That assumes Brooklyn goes 5-0 and the Pacers go 1-3 for the Nets to get the 3 seed.  Not likely, but this was a must win regardless.
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::Didn't get to see the 2nd half but damn that was a hell of a comeback, even if it was the Cavs.
joe_the_buckeye::It does help some when the team you're playing has every incentive to lose the game....=)
YogaBeer::JollySwagman27 - and you'd never know it from the way the Cavs played the first 25 minutes of the game!  Cavs were down 13 points in the 1 Q.    That was a good comeback as well.
joe_the_buckeye::True enough. I didn't watch any of the game, so I wouldn't know anyways.
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::Kyrie didn't look like he wanted to lose in the first half!
JollySwagman27::and you'd never know it from the way the Cavs played the first 25 minutes of the game!
JollySwagman27::i'm sorry you had to watch the 1st half and miss the 2nd.  Any Pacer fan would've preferred it the other way around.
BiggestHandsomeHoosierLovedAndHated::Yeah I wanted to see the 2nd half, but with the 3rd spot pretty much locked in, not many of these remaining games are THAT important.
zachzach1010::To be a Cleveland sports fan, you have to believe that the teams will improve next year ( it just seems that next year never arrives).
YogaBeer::Richard Cranium
Taco has a Q::Nice to see the Pacers play with heart in the 4th
JollySwagman27::they sure as hell forgot it in the first 3, didn't they?
Area55andG2::If Frank didn't get ejected, I don't know if we would've won.
Taco has a Q::I agree,  I think the players got the message after that.  Vogel stepped on the court to make sure he was getting tossed
JollySwagman27::play of the game was getting ejected on purpose!
JohnsonnnL::Could we possibly get both Porter and Len?
Rcrown10::whos Porter and Len ?
YogaBeer::There are some teams disparate for draft picks due to a number of reasons.    The big one is this new CBA.
YogaBeer::In fact, you watch, the Cavs pick him 1st no matter where they are and a bunch of fans go "WTF?"   And then he wins the ROY like what Kyrie did and what Waiters fell one injury just shy of.
YogaBeer::Agree 110 %
JohnsonnnL::I like Lens potential, he could be similiar to Vucevic.
YogaBeer::Yes.  Trading 3 of the 4 picks.
dwightmare 2 the sequel::Drew Carey is wrong....Cleveland sucks
YogaBeer::Awwww   you found the she/males left over from the LeBron James days.
HunterF4444::You have to enjoy pain to be a Cleveland fan.
JollySwagman27::being from Indiana, (and attending Purdue and Indiana U)  I'm trained to hate Ohio State.  Nothing personal against buckeye state residents... Big10 rivals are the devil   :D
JollySwagman27::you've been kicking our butts for decades... there's some animosity there.   :D
joe_the_buckeye::I will say, Purdue always plays us tough. Maybe now I know why.  I didn't realize that you guys hated us so much.
JohnsonnnL::I'm glad Michigan lost last night. Trey Burke is a traitor.
JollySwagman27::I know you don't hate Purdue.  We were never worth respecting and were rarely a challenge to you in football.  I really, really hated losing at home to you guys!
joe_the_buckeye::lol...we don't really hate IU or Purdue, it's all about scUM. PSU and UW are probably second hated here.
YogaBeer::There are two things that have me puzzled.    The Cavaliers are still bringing fans in and we stink.     The Browns haven't sniffed anything good since Bernie and fans not only buy all the tickets, you have to also buy a license for the ticket.
YogaBeer::Not all the time, just lately.     ...well the Browns have stunk it up pretty much for a long time.
joe_the_buckeye::That's what I love about Cleveland. There is some incredible dedication and passion in our fanbase. People will hang in there through thick and thin. I'm proud of that, even if we lose all the time.
Area55andG2::I was going to say Ohio State but that's debatable too. their football program is under ncaa sanctions. the b-ball teams's pretty good though
joe_the_buckeye::ummm....12-0 last year in FB? Back-to-back E8s and F4 last year in BB.
HunterF4444::Ohio State is one of the most successful football/basketball schools in the country.
YogaBeer::OSU's football program is under NCAA sanctions again?   What now?
joe_the_buckeye::Or losing.
dwightmare 2 the sequel::What is half of infinity?

YogaBeer::No
joe_the_buckeye::1/200
YogaBeer::yes
Area55andG2::go to the Bulls Raptors board to see what I am talking about. Carp's a fish right?

YogaBeer::It's those last two that were a doozy!
YogaBeer::Hey.    We started off really good.
joe_the_buckeye::That's what you get when you cross Ubaldo Jimenez and Brett Myers...
JohnsonnnL::I'm going to be pissed if the Lakers choke away our pick. Kobe should just retire if they don't make the playoffs, so I don't have to look at him.
JollySwagman27::i called at the start of the season that they would be injury-prone and have chemistry issues.  it wasn't hard to see that coming.
Yata-garasu::No excuse for them...  Bryant, Howard, Nash...  Still struggling.  Lol.  Bryant is really overrated.  Great player but overrated.
YogaBeer::Old
Yata-garasu::Can you guys beat Miami....  Please Pacers.....
Jeff Pendergraph Number 1 Fan::Miami did the same thing to the cavs a few weeks ago...
iownamicrowave::just vote for us in the who are you rooting for poll in a few months.
joe_the_buckeye::Heck, I'm not afraid to beg.   PLEASE!!!! PLEASE!!!
dwightmare 2 the sequel::Brian Shaw is a beast
JollySwagman27::nice threads he was sporting tonight.
GeorgeTownDC29::Is there anyway the Pacers can win the east? Please win the east!
joe_the_buckeye::Anybody but Miami can win the East.
JollySwagman27::I'd rather my Pacers get swept by the Knicks and they win the east than see the Celtics in the finals.
GeorgeTownDC29::Or the Knicks. Cant stand both.
JollySwagman27::not the regular season.... at least one fan base is hoping for the Pacers in the finals.  (probably 1 or 2 anti-Miami bases too)
zachzach1010::Are you begging?
joe_the_buckeye::Just go away.
NolaJag::This has tank job written all over it
Yata-garasu::Jazz down to OKC...  I'm Rooting for LA...
pacerpride35::And if I did, these two words would apply: Closed casket.
JollySwagman27::LMAO.  good call sir.  I'm lucky that i found a bisexual girl who doesn't mind sharing.
pacerpride35::Being married, I'd better not be choosing between two women.
JollySwagman27::i'm married too.  i just have two words for you  "OPEN MARRIAGE"
pacerpride35::Now this is a conundrum. I'd like to see Utah make the playoffs, but I'd also like to see the Lakers lose their lottery pick to Cleveland. It's like choosing between two beautiful women. Either way you win, but either way you lose.
JollySwagman27::you haven't had enough 3-somes.  I don't have to choose between the 2 women.
joe_the_buckeye::We're all huge Lakers fans here in Cleveland.
JollySwagman27::my mistake, i forgot that you get it if the lakers end up making it in.
JollySwagman27::rooting for LA won't win you any friends here.
Yata-garasu::It think it would be better if LA makes it and the Cavs get the pick because 1.  I root for the Cavs. 2.  They will be crushed in the playoffs.
joe_the_buckeye::lol...that pick swap thing sure has made for strange bedfellows.
JollySwagman27::I'm rooting for Phoenix to get the Lakers lottery pick.  screw L.A.
Yata-garasu::We need their lottery pick...  Any other reason and I wouldn't be.  I don't like the Lakers at all...
YogaBeer::sure it will
