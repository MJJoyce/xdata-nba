BANKROBBA2020::This young $@%!$ Lizard is going to be ROY, you'll see.
phunky58::way to light it up mr. Lillard aka rookie of the year
Minnysota Vikings::Kahn seems to suck at drafting in the lottery, but does well when drafting in the 2nd round or signing a small name from overseas. Nikola Pekovic was a 2nd round pick. Alexey Shved was undrafted. Mickael Gelebale and Chris Johnson were recent 10-day contract signings due to the amount of injuries, and they've both been surprisingly good so far. Just sucks that Kahn went after Brandon Roy for 5 million a year when he could have had O.J Mayo for 4 million smh
Boneshank::Really? I'm sure I recall an article somewhere stating that Mayo didn't want to go to Minnesota, or something like that.  Sometimes the smaller market, less hyped teams need to overpay and/or take risks that the flashier, larger market teams do not.  The Jazz deal with the same issue, as do the Blazers, I'm sure.
Minnysota Vikings::Well, I need to get to bed, already 3 AM where I'm at. Nice chatting with you.
Boneshank::Agreed.  The Spurs are the kingpins of the diamond-mining game.  The Wolves definitely have a few gems now, though.  Not necessarily diamonds (yet), but definitely gems of some sort.
Minnysota Vikings::Mayo could have said that, but I don't remember hearing anything about it. That's why I'm glad the Wolves have been so involved in scouting players from overseas. It helps close the gap that bigger markets have on the talent pool. The Wolves aren't going to sign a big name NBA player in free agency like you stated, so trying to get the diamonds in the rough from Europe and other places like that is beneficial. Kind of the same thing the Spurs have done for the past 10-12 years.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::What about this: http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=b3h797l
Minnysota Vikings::In all fairness to Big Al though, you guys did screw us in the Jefferson trade. What did we  get from you again? a couple draft picks? Meh
Boneshank::Hah. Kahn is a guy that I picture going into the dollar store to buy one thing, and being the only one in line digging in his pocket for the extra quarter to make $1.25...
Minnysota Vikings::Oh yeah, Koufos too. Denver fans I've talked to hate him lol
Minnysota Vikings::Yes, most definitely. Although Kahn has improved a little bit lately.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::He's a handsome fellah
Boneshank::Koufos, no?  He's doing okay in Denver, I believe.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::KOC &gt; Khan. That one you know is true
Minnysota Vikings::not much value for a guy who was averaging 20/10 at the time and was young.
Boneshank::Hell, let's throw in Bell, Watson, and Tinsley, and they can add Rubio to the two Ruskies!
Boneshank::Did the Wolves just hire Otis Smith, or something?  I missed that newsfeed...
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I was gonna throw in Raja Bell but the machine wouldn't let me.
Minnysota Vikings::Asking for both of our Russians is out of line, sir.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::In Mother Russia, players trade you!
Boneshank::I would be happy if the Jazz could trade Jefferson back to the Wolves, in exchange for Rick Adelman.  Y'know, someone who can actually develop young talent (hint to Corbin - it starts with putting them in the game).
BillWaltonsHair::I wouldn't have said this not all that long ago, but I could see the 'blazers winning 3 of 6 on this road trip.
BillWaltonsHair::Righto, carry on...
BillWaltonsHair::Yes, that's my point, Captain Obvious.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yes, I was sympathizing with you.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::You know you're a bad road team when you have a six game road trip, four of which are against teams with losing records, and you think they might win half.
Minnysota Vikings::Yeah the Jazz usually have one of the largest disparities in the league between home and road records. EnergySolutions Arena is a really tough place to play.
scow79::Well it should be obvious.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I'm a Jazz fan, as you'd see by scrolling over my name. They suck just as bad on the road. I'm doing no Blazers trolling.
Minnysota Vikings::And just which team do you root for Tremors? Curious as to why you're trolling the Blazers so much.
Minnysota Vikings::Inexcusable for the Jazz to get outrebounded as badly as they did.
Boneshank::Agreed, Minny.  The one &amp; only advantage that the Jazz take into each game against virtually every team, is its size advantage.  Out-rebounding the other team each &amp; every time out should be the benchmark for how hard the Jazz are playing.  Unfortunately, with Jefferson soaking up so much of the playing time out there, the answer will often be "not very hard".
TAC0REV::Jefferson's complete lack of ability to do anything that remotely resembles an attempt to "box out" is about as painful as it gets.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Never thought I'd hear about AK being consistently healthy.
Minnysota Vikings::I'd love to have Al back, but AK47 is the only guy on the Wolves who's been consistent (either with his play or staying healthy). We wouldn't have won 10 games this year without him.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::We'll trade you Big Gay Al if you give us AK47 back. Deal?
scow79::Yep.   Minnesota fans are the only fans out there who can really understand just what Jazz fans are talking about when it comes to Big Al.
TAC0REV::Fixed it.
Minnysota Vikings::I remember Big Al from his days in Minny. Great post-up scorer, but his poor defense and sometimes disappearance on the boards always kept him from being great.
scow79::You can't watch it, bc it doesn't happen.   He doesn't even attempt to box out.  Like boneshank said earlier, that would require him to bend his knees.
scow79::When you don't box out and just try to out jump the opposing player, these things happen.   They happen quite frequently actually.
schwabs911::Well it's been fun. I'm out, though it's been fun to talk about how Jefferson is the Jazz's savior of the season. Nightie night boys.
Rip City Forever::This tremors guys seems to have have any decent knowledge towards the nba game of basketball. Or is just a complete lame of a troll. Lol whatevs! Blazers got the last laugh
JPHoks1981::OK well I'm off to bed goodnight Jazz fans.
JPHoks1981::Thanks. You should probably find a new way to feel good about yourself. Take your skill to the schools not to ESPN.com
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::No. People at school are smart. Here, I get to be much, much smarter than you. It makes me feel warm and cuddly on the inside.
JPHoks1981::I think its more pathetic to go on a sports site to correct adults spelling then to spell the word wrong, but that's just me.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I'll give you two and a half right. Adults is also possessive. He could not use the "an" and it would be adults' spelling. If he added the an, since it would become singular, it would be adult's spelling.
scow79::I think I got all three.   He didn't use an apostrophe in the word its, he needed to add an before adults and he used then instead of than.   Am I correct, professor?
Boneshank::Heh.  I come for the basketball banter, but stay for the theater.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::At least I didn't correct the three grammatical errors you made in that sentence.
scow79::I take it you've been corrected a few times then?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yes. That's just you. We all have our pet peeves. That is mine.
scow79::Why can't he be a troll with a decent amount of knowledge of the NBA game?   Why must it be one of the other
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::They don't have to be mutually exclusive terms.
JPHoks1981::I do like the Dynamite quote.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Don't be jealous that I'm smarter than you and have been chatting online with babes, all day.
schwabs911::Ok, the babe part got a like from me.
JPHoks1981::Watch out he may come back with a grammar or spelling error on your $@%.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::He did say "have have," but it's not as irritating as an adult who doesn't know the difference between your and you're.
TAC0REV::I just love the clueless Al Jefferson apologists. "Where will the Jazz get all their scoring?"  Where was Golden State going to get points when they traded their leading scorer, Monta Ellis? That's funny, they got better. How about the Nuggets when they traded Carmelo Anthony? They are also getting better. Now we see the Grizzlies trading away one of their top scorers, Rudy Gay, because they aspire for greater heights.  An inefficient volume scorer that doesn't play defense (or box out half the time) is not going to lead any team anywhere. Period.
schwabs911::HA! Gordon Hayward probably doesn't even average 30 minutes a game and he is supposed to be the up and coming star of the team. You guys have a log jam at the big section. Playing a player like Favors that many minutes is ridiculous. Lillard averages 38.5 minutes per game and he is Portlands sole point guard that can really do anything.
scow79::You missed the per 36 minutes part.
schwabs911::it's 13.5 according to nba.com
TAC0REV::Well Jefferson is only averaging 16 (even though he usually takes 15-20 shots to get there) per game, and he's a big time star, according to schwabs.
scow79::He's averaging 18.5/4/3.5 per 36.   It's becoming obvious you don't watch Jazz games.
schwabs911::Hayward is alright but nothing special. You give 35 minutes and above to players who are the stars of the team, not someone averaging about 14 points per game
scow79::Yep.   Gordo only averages 26 and it's a travesty.   Should be averaging around 35 also.
schwabs911::I'm not quite sure if you remember but Curry was a starting from the beginning. He had an amazing shot that gave Golden State immediate offense. Plus, last time I checked, Favors gets 20 minutes each game consistently. Could be wrong, but his playing time really isn't that small.
Boneshank::Y'know, the hallmark of being a "great scorer" throughout the history of the league, is generating approximately 1.5 points per FG attempt.  Scan down the top 20 scorers in NBA history -- hell, make it top 100 -- and the vast majority of them will be in that 1.5pts/FGA range.  Al Jefferson is not in that range.  Not even close.  So, as with other players of that ilk (ie Monta Ellis, Rudy Gay, JR Smith, etc), your team's offense better not be centered around him, or else you'll be doomed to fail with it as much as you may succeed.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::He's shooting 69%. Not great, but that can improve with hard work. Karl Malone shot near 50% when he entered the league and was near 80% when he retired.
schwabs911::and PS-Its not all about points. Its about having someone to go to when you are in a drought. It's about having a go to guy in those big moments. Go ahead, put Favors in. I would love to play hack-a-Favors when the game gets tight down the road.
scow79::2.5 blocks and 1.5 steals per 36 according to basketball reference.   But how could we ever get by without Big Al's 19 points on 17 shots every night?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::And if he got the minutes Jefferson got, in that 33-35 range, he'd be at 15 and 10, while playing much better defense.
scow79::20 minutes for a player like Favors is indeed small.   He should be getting around 35 minutes a night IMO.
schwabs911::Rudy Gay was traded away because of cap reasons. Golden State is killing teams because they have developed Curry a lot more and have amazing bigs, as well as Thompson has stepped up his game. But I do love seeing Foye shoot those threes all night...
schwabs911::You might want to care about Foye considering he hoisted 12 three point shots and was your leading scorer...just saying.
TAC0REV::The funny part is this guy bringing up Foye, a player no one cares about.
scow79::Here comes the "Curry didn't have a player of  Big Al's quality on the team" argument.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Was Curry developed while sitting on the bench?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I honestly have never seen Al Jefferson get in a defensive position.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Ha. Well done.
Boneshank::For the few short minutes every game that he goes to the bench, Jefferson momentarily bends his legs in a defensive-like posture... as he sits down.  I believe that is the only time I see him bend his Frankensteinian stilts.
JPHoks1981::Scow check the Houston and Washington games for example if you want to keep talking Burks to Tinsley +/- .
JPHoks1981::Ask Nolan Smith about his defense.
JPHoks1981::The way you get minutes is doing something while your in. You have to earn them. He hasnt.
scow79::I'd contest that he does do something while he's in the game.   He plays far better defense than Tinsley or Watson and he is an actual offensive threat.
Boneshank::Except on the Jazz.  On the Jazz, you must have the arbitrary label of "veteran" attached to your player biography to obtain substantial playing time, else be relegated to the pine, to be called upon sporadically in Corbin's nonsensical rotational patterns to periodically attempt to dig the team out of the hole that the "veterans" have dug.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::you're* and he isn't given consistent minutes. That's not how a player develops. Granted, Burks is no Durant, but Durant spent his first two seasons jacking up garbage and trying to figure things out, looking foolish half the time in the process until he got to where he is now. Give him 25 minutes a game, every game, for 40 games and then we'll see where he's at.
TAC0REV::What does Watson or Tinsley do to earn all the minutes they get?? Nothing! Both are complete and utter garbage, and no other team would sign them. If Burks were available, on the other hand, teams would be lining up all over the place to try and sign him.
JPHoks1981::Just trying to figure out the Burks man crush situation, but he is right he did answer what I asked correctly, good work
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I have no idea what this topic of convo is, but you can always find a stat or game that contradicts a generally applicable situation.
scow79::Same here.   When he gets consistent minutes and hurts the team then I'll start to criticize the guy.  Until then he gets the benefit of the doubt from me.
Boneshank::I wasn't aware there was a Burks train.  Corbin must have fired the conductor &amp; unhooked the engine at the terminal, if there ever was such a train.   Corbin needs to go.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::LOL. I'll say the same thing I've said all along. I'm on the Burks train until he is given consistent, and worthwhile minutes and THEN gives me reason to get off.
scow79::For some reason this guy doesn't like Burks and thinks we should all get off the Burks train.
scow79::You can pick and choose numbers all you want.   You asked what Burks did that Tinsley wasn't able to do during this game and I answered you that he wasn't -12
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I'd rather win a game 80-70 than lose 100-90... Maybe that's just me.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Said the guy that's still here.
bcouch3::MAn are you still here????? get a life!!!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::What is Carmelo Anthony's biggest issue? He's only a scorer and a terrible defender and that's why his teams have, on the whole, never gone anywhere. Al Jefferson is the same thing, except not as good a scorer.
schwabs911::Is that why Carmelo has his team 2nd in the east?
Boneshank::Yeah, I'm afraid anyone who judges teams East-vs-West isn't exactly doing an apples to apples comparison.  More like apples to... raisins?  Many times through the years, the Jazz (or Blazers, or Rockets, et al) would have been a shoo-in for the ECF/Finals if they happened to be blessed with being in the Leastern Conference.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::And the Knicks have done a good job of getting some players to help compensate for his lack of defense. Might be worth doing with someone who can score like he can. Jefferson cannot score like he can, so his lack of D is (a) not worth compensating for and (b) more difficult to compensate for
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::With their record against the west, they would be right there with the Jazz in 7th place in the west. East is horrible.
scow79::But if we didn't have Big Al, then we wouldn't get that coveted 8th seed and a 4 game sweep in the playoffs.  With him giving up after game 3
scow79::You are correct Sir
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::And by after game 3, you mean at halftime of game 3.
Benjamayne::why are the blazers not better? they have lillard batum and aldridge playing awesome.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Lillard is a rookie, Batum is not that great and Aldridge gets outplayed by too many players.
big145fly::Batum is the second highest assisting forward behind LeBron  and just as good a defender.. if he had a consistent 15 shot attempts a game he would be a 23-6-5 type of guy
Rip City Forever::Lowest scoring bench in league history lol that's why
TAC0REV::Yep, the Jazz are right on course for their 8th seed and first round playoff embarrassment, just like last year. All this organization cares about is getting its playoff revenue, and I'm sick of it. Corbin couldn't coach a Junior Jazz team, but the front office doesn't care because we can squeak into the playoffs and they'll get their money. We're the definition of mediocrity because Corbin insists on playing the mediocre vets instead of investing playing time in the young players of the future, but who cares? We'll barely get into the playoffs and the ownership will have achieved its goal of winning its playoff money. Go playoff money!
schwabs911::The 0-22 is an exaggeration. And that's alright tacorev, being a Ute fan is difficult. At least you can find some solace in the fact that they beat BYU in football this year...
schwabs911::Oh tac0rev, keep thinking you are incredibly intelligent when it comes to basketball.Like I stated before, people can have their own opinions on the matter if they would like. But I'm sure you are the God of Basketball.
TAC0REV::There you go, change the subject to college football now that your lack of basketball knowledge has become so evident.
TAC0REV::You're hopeless. If you're not smart enough to see it now, you never will. Yes, Jefferson can score (sometimes) but he makes the team around him worse for reasons that have already been discussed. He's not a team guy. Jazz basketball is team basketball, and they will be better on offense without him.
scow79::For the record I only called you dumb because you implied that if Kanter were to get minutes he'd go 0-22, basing it on the rare game that he went 0-7.   He's shooting 55%, which is better than any other big on the team.
TAC0REV::Yep. Now go away.
schwabs911::Hopeless? So someone has a different thought process then you and you call me not smart? Wow...sounds like a jazz fan.
schwabs911::How did Memphis do in that eight spot a couple of years ago? The Jazz don't need a pick in the draft. They need a star to get it done. I don't think being in the 7th spot with a pretty good upcoming schedule is a very bad place to be in if you ask me.
scow79::Yes, we do need a star.   Not Big Al, who is the definition of mediocre.
schwabs911::So...how did the Jazz get into the playoff picture then if Jefferson is such a "cancer" to the team? Right now Favors is not the main focus of the opposing team. You really think that he will perform like he does now if the other team was scouting more on him then they do now? He has terrific defense, don't get me wrong. But the Jazz need offense and Jefferson gives them that.
TAC0REV::I called him a cancer in the sense that this team will never get better than what it is now — mediocre — as long as he's around. Not in the sense that he's a locker room problem.
Boneshank::I don't think any rational fan is calling Jefferson a cancer, because that isn't the problem with him.  The problem is that he is used as a featured scorer &amp; the focal point of an offense, with the minutes &amp; volume of shots afforded by Coach Corbin's more-than-generous rotations favoring the veterans, rather than the "best" lineups.  Jefferson, I feel, is a lot better professional &amp; teammate than Boozer ever was, but their games provide a net gain of zero (or negative), even while their individual stats look good.  The cost of playing them outweighs the benefit, that's all.
scow79::You don't want to be an 8th seed in the NBA.  You either want to be really good, or really bad.   Not in the middle which is exactly where the Jazz will always be relying on Al Jefferson's terrible defense.
TAC0REV::For every game that Jefferson has come up big in the final moments (which were mostly against bad teams, and it was his fault it was so close in the first place with his terrible excuse for defense and inefficiency on offense) there has been at least as many games where he went 3-for-18 or 4-for-17. Jefferson is a good guy, but on the court he's a cancer. There's a reason the stinking Timberwolves were so willing to literally give him away to us for nothing. It's sad that a terrible franchise historically has the sense to dump this guy first chance they get, but here we are still stuck with him three seasons later.
schwabs911::Yeah, he's a ball stopper, yet you want Foye hoisting up shots? How would you like for Favors to actually take a good amount of free throws with that horrendous shot of his? Most of the Jazz players are mediocre and very streaky. Every game I have seen the Jazz play, Jefferson has been the one to come up big in the last moments. Once they got away from Jefferson in the closing minutes of the game and let foye go for low percentage shots, then the game was lost. But that's alright. I hope you guys trade Jefferson and find out that he is the only reason that the Jazz have the record they do.
TAC0REV::I love how he just brought up Jefferson's salary, as if he's actually earning it. He gets paid 15 MILLION. Even the dumbest Al Jefferson apologists would have to admit he isn't worth even close to that.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Must be a big Monta Ellis fan.
scow79::But hey, keep buying into those empty stats there buddy
scow79::And he plays defense like my 84 year old grandpa.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Again, 15 pts and a +10 is better than 25 pts and a - 10.
schwabs911::You guys are delusional. I still remember a little bit ago when the Jazz were a couple games below 500. Everyone started acting like it was the end of the world and I even heard fans say they should blow the team up. Kanter hasn't earned a thing. Favors, yes, he deserves a few more minutes but Jefferson is the man. He gets paid like the man and he puts up buckets like the man.
scow79::Now you're just being dumb.  0-22 really?   And even if he did go 0-22 every night, then at least we'd know, right?    Here's a thought, maybe with playing time he's better than Big Al.   We already know he's better on the defensive end.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::And if that happened, then so be it.
schwabs911::Yeah, Kanter just might go 0 for 22 instead of 0 for 7 like tonight.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Players can't develop if they don't get time to develop. It seems I speak for the majority of Jazz fans when I say I would rather they lose now and develop players that trod around around the 6-10 seed with Jefferson running the show.
scow79::I don't know.   Give him 35 minutes a night like your boy Lazy Al instead of 5 and we'll all find out.
schwabs911::Ha! The evidence? Disgruntled jazz fans are the evidence? Please. I have to listen to sports talk radio all day at work and all the fans do is mumble and grumble about how Favors and Kanter don't get enough playing time. How did Kanter do again?
scow79::The evidence is in my favor schwabs.  You don't think there is a problem with Big Al.  Maybe watch a little more closely.
TAC0REV::Bingo, Boneshank. I'd rather see what the young guys can do, even if it means getting worse in the short term, than re-sign Jefferson for five years knowing we'll get an 8-seed and swept in the first round for all five years.
schwabs911::You should probably not judge how much basketball I watch and hear about scow79. I'm living in Utah right now. I watch most games.
Boneshank::You may be right.  But one thing we do know is that, with Jefferson playing the marquee role, mediocrity is the Jazz's ceiling.  With that said, why not shake things up, ditch Jefferson, and see what the young guys can achieve?  If they do no better, fine. If they do worse, fine. But at least they'd know.  They just may do better, though. Being mired in mediocrity in the NBA is a lose-lose situation.  Both the Blazers &amp; Jazz should know this.
scow79::You probably should watch more Jazz games before telling a Jazz fan all about Jefferson and his team.   Just a suggestion.
TAC0REV::Oh really? Jefferson's 12 points on 13 shots was a positive for the Jazz? Nope, sorry, that's a negative. I didn't say a word about Jefferson, but since you brought him up, yep he's a ball-stopper, momentum-killer, hopelessly inefficient, and the absolute laziest player in the league when it comes to defending and boxing out. The Jazz's ceiling with Jefferson in the lineup is nothing more than its current mediocrity.
schwabs911::Oh shut up already. You jazz fans continue to complain about Jefferson and Millsap playing so many minutes but Jefferson is the only reason you guys stayed in the game.
Minnysota Vikings::Nic Batum is just awesome. Blazers were smart for matching the Wolves offer.
Rip City Forever::Wolves were smart for offering it to him. By the way, pekovic is a stud
big145fly::Watch management pull the same $@%! they did with roy hibbert.
R Barron::This rivalry is gonna be awesome for ten years
JPHoks1981::Im hoping the Burks hype will calm down a bit now
TAC0REV::Here's an example. Last year the Jazz had Josh Howard. Corbin started him and played him as many minutes as he could, despite Howard being a completely useless hack. The year ended, his contract was up, and no teams wanted him. Not a single team. He's sitting at home right now. That's what kind of players Corbin likes to give lots of minutes, when we have lots of young talent that needs lots of playing time to develop, and they're not getting it.
TAC0REV::Are you kidding me? Tinsley and Watson are both completely useless. If the Jazz don't re-sign them (which with our FO's track record, they'll probably moronically re-sign both) not a single team in the league will even consider signing them. They don't belong in the NBA. Burks has huge potential but rarely gets the chance to develop. He's still pretty raw but he will be exponentially better than either of those hacks when he peaks.
JPHoks1981::I personally would rather see Tinsley in the game at the point that Burks. What did Burks do tonight that Tinsley cant?
scow79::Burks wasn't -12 in +/- for one.
TAC0REV::When the alternatives are Watson and Tinsley, two players that shouldn't even be in the NBA, Burks should be playing.
JPHoks1981::No, Thank you! Glad somebody agrees.
R Barron::Thank you!
Rip City Forever::Only reason jazz fans are hatin is cause they are jealous. We have lillard and Aldridge and a bright future but Utah has no idea what direction they are going to go!
ClydeTheGlide_22::They always seem to go on and on about how much potential they have, but really, who do they have that will be good in the future! 4 of our starters are under 25 and all average double figure scoring, 2 putting up all star worthy numbers
Rip City Forever::Who is their core group of guys that they are trying to build around? Kanter and Hayward? Don't get me wrong, they are solid building pieces but shouldn't be the core. Blazers have batum Aldridge and lillard, that's something special in the making.
D-Lillard-0::Go Blazers sorry but jazz sucks and they  dont have  a good team or any good player  we have Lillard  LA  Batum JJ wes complete even our bench  is worst in NBA but still better than jazz  lol nolan and will raped jazz hahah  after few games we will be back in our spot at 5-6 seed  Lakers at 8 and jazz  lottery pick haha Lillard alone owned jazz hard
D-Lillard-0::deronwilliams sorry but if you are looking for a job as english teacher lol go somwhere else  coz not everyone is from USA  ( arschloch ) they are only 3 games ahead we had few weeks ago better record than utah and houston   ??  we will get our spot back again after few games
Rip City Forever::I hate when people try to correct you on here. It's so lame and pointless to care
DeronWilliams58::Work on your grammer! Also who has the better record?
schwabs911::work on your spelling perhaps? it's grammar.
ClydeTheGlide_22::I think that if Olshey can trade some of the bench before the deadline for some good players, or sign a veteran FA, then we will get the 7th or 8th seed. But in the next few years, yeah Blazers will be a team on the rise with the young core of Lillard and batum
ItAlwaysRainsInAutzen::Im lovin these Jazz fans predicting their team finishing above houston in the playoff race.  Just to jog your memory that is the team that beat you by 45.....in Utah
ItAlwaysRainsInAutzen::but hey I guess exceptions are made for al jefferson and the almighty jazz
ItAlwaysRainsInAutzen::I dont recall many of the actually descent teams in the nba getting run out of their own arena by an overrated young team with a point guard who cant even dribble without looking at the floor
jazzmantitch::The f--- difference does it make if you win by 1 point or 45 points? It's just 1 win.
ItAlwaysRainsInAutzen::I know i know, the Jazz are too good and the championship is seemingly theirs for the taking
ItAlwaysRainsInAutzen::o yes, and this was just another one of those "fluke" wins for the opposing team Jazz losses arent REAL losses at all
Grantox::rockets are a good team no doubt. but very streaky. jazz have a favorable schedule and at current rate should finish 6-8 seed rockets 6-8 seed finish also
Grantox::ummm yeah it was a fluke win and you know it! maybe not win but by 45 was a fluke. it happens! guess we will see in 34 games huh!
mikeisildur::ROCKETS COACH BIG JERK!  PEOPLE WANT TO SEE JEREMY PLAY!  WHY HE ON THE BENCH??
Grantox::without our best defender and our pg. yes bad nioght for sure but jazz have beat rockets a couple times already. and houston has done that on several teams, they can score no doubt but they are streaky!
mikeisildur::Yes, clearly one lopsided fluke win has some bearing on remaining games against other opponents.    I'd tell you to go back to your own boards, but they're overrun with Rockets "fans" screaming inane gibberish about Jeremy Lin.  I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy..
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yowsa, I just looked at Portland's schedule. Enjoy the .500 because after the 6 game road trip, that will be the last they see of it.
ClydeTheGlide_22::Someone's butt.hurt.
Grantox::yeah.
Grantox::wont happen but it could uder those circumstances
Grantox::i really think 50 is possible if jefferson is out mo and hayward are back
Grantox::well considering they played 17 at home and 24 on road first half of season and reverse the second half.  they were 22-19 first half so if they do that good  the second half they will hit 44 wins and with 7 more home games they should hit 46-48 ( as long as jefferson gets injured or traded they could break 50
Grantox::give hayward more mins instead of 23. theres more points let kanter play he can score and dominate often! he just doesnt get chance. favors needs more mins. with jefferson gone, favors kanter and millsap can add more points hayward is pretty dang clutch down the stretch minus the pacer game
Grantox::yes i recall the hayward fiasco! but that is one game ! thats it! jefferson comes up bigo n offense alot yes but at what cost? how many is he giving up on D. is his 17 pts a night more than what he gives up on D? not likely!
mikeisildur::As soon as they get 1 other player that can score on demand with any degree of regularity, I agree, get rid of Jefferson.  He's a huge defensive liability.  But they would have lost that game without him.  Recall, also, that it was Hayward that nearly blew that game.
Grantox::jefferson has to score 30+ per night just to equate what he gives up on defense!
Grantox::its not a secret that kanter and favors play and the paint gets sealed off! jefferson comes in and paint is open
Grantox::are you kidding!!! jefferson gives up so many points in the paint!!!! that pacer game should not have even been close if jefferson could guard the paint!
mikeisildur::In fairness there aren't a lot of losses that can be directly attributed to Jefferson alone, and there are a few wins (that last Indiana game comes to mind) that can.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Indeed, that's why 44-48 is fair.
Grantox::yep! and jazz should be mid to high 40s for wins portland will be lucky to hit 40 wins
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yeah, 44-48 is fair, assuming health of course.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Which are the worst fans of the perennially awful teams who begin each year saying they will make the playoffs, then by mid-season it's about how young they are and "in a couple" years they will own the league? Cleveland? New Orleans?
mikeisildur::Not ACL tears to their starting point guards. That's kind of a big deal. ______________________________________  Well, for one, this has been ongoing for like 8 seasons about how the wolves will be amazing "next year."  And as to grantox's point, they really should have seen the whole Brandon Roy thing coming, at the very least.
Grantox::agreed on roy. butttt love rubio pek all missed several games and couple other key players as well thats pretty rough for any team like like wade and lebron both going down. heat would suck( not say rubio love are equal matches just saying your best players going down
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yeah, don't buy it. It's always something.
mikeisildur::May I present the Timberwolves for consideration?
Mittens___the cat::man, i come back to this forum and i see all you fools hating on my wolves. F all yall. One gaming winning streak!!!!!!!
Grantox::what dont you buy! love been out half the season rubio half the season roy the whole season pek missed  abunch and several others! you cant win win 4 guys are out 203 of them starters
dspdevildog::Not great, but playoff bound
Grantox::you cant hate on the wolves when rubio love pek roy etc all went down. they could have been great
dspdevildog::Not ACL tears to their starting point guards.  That's kind of a big deal.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I don't buy it. All teams have injuries.
mikeisildur::I swear every game is a swarm of cats telling me to "wait 'til next year."
Grantox::no becaue they had legit shot but wayyyy to many injuries
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::You may. Good inclusion.
dspdevildog::BTDubs, Tremors 2 has it all over Tremors
dspdevildog::So much hostility
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::And by the use of BTDubs, I will now no longer respond to you ever again.
dspdevildog::Cleveland has Irving so they have hope.  Did you see him take apart Westbrook tonight?
ensign.devyn::Go to their boards, or wait till your team plays them.
dspdevildog::No one is Lebron, but I never really hear Cleveland fans or New Orleans fans...because there are about 9 of them between the two.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Quite a different story. Irving is great, but he's no Lebron, for one.
ensign.devyn::Yeah, cause the East is a powerhouse, and they got beat by the Mavs in the Finals.
dspdevildog::Yeah.  Nothing like taking a team to the finals and ECF to show how bad they were.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::He's very good, but not hardly the point.
ensign.devyn::Yeah, but they need to build a team around him, and their organization couldn't build a team around Lebron very well, so no worries there
Grantox::hmmmm no t sure
ensign.devyn::Cleveland hands down. Lebron fooled them into thinking they're a good franchise, even without him.
Grantox::fyi portland go look at your up coming schedule then at jazz schedule portland will maybe hit 38-40 wins jazz will hit 46-48 wins
schwabs911::We play better against quality teams to be honest. I mean, we have won the games we shouldn't have and lost the games we should of won. I wouldn't count Portland out. Yes it's going to be difficult but that doesn't mean its implausible.
legend_jr27::I think Port will get to 41 and have the 9th seed. Utah should get in with 43 min. Hous should get 44 min. Utah and Hous have more games at home but neither one has an easy schedule. Plus a number of these teams play each other
hookem5746::Portland fan / jazz hater: if u are so good why is your power rating 22?????
dspdevildog::because UT sucks
Grantox::read above post
Grantox::cause of huge houston loss!
Grantox::no hayward no D
ensign.devyn::If we are so bad and you are so good, why are we ahead of you, with playing a tougher scheudle so far?
ensign.devyn::Well, 1 game always determines everything.
hookem5746::Grantox - jazz are ahead of houston for 1. second jazz played more games on the road then at home they had tougher schedule by far  I'm comparing Houston to the blazers not the jazz.  We also beat Utah by 45 on the road; your worse home loss EVER
Grantox::jazz are ahead of houston for 1. second jazz played more games on the road then at home they had tougher schedule by far
ensign.devyn::Look at teams you've faced, and home games against road games, bud.
hookem5746::ensign.devyn - So? Haha  So everyone's record during a back to back is worse genius.  Most compacted schedule
ensign.devyn::So? Haha
hookem5746::ensign.devyn - You've played a much easier schedule too, so it still applies.  We have the most back to backs in the NBA.  Wrong again
ensign.devyn::You've played a much easier schedule too, so it still applies.
hookem5746::I'm a rockets fan; u are behind me
hookem5746::Hey rip city; this is what the experts think of your chances.  Check your $@%!$@ power rankings too!!!  Hollinger playoff odds:  Golden St: 95.1%.      29-17 Houston: 81.8%.        26-23 Utah: 54.1%.               26-22 Lakers: 32.4%.            21-26 Dallas: 19.7%.             20-27 Portland: 18.3%.          24-23
D-Lillard-0::just so you know we beat  your houston twice   we are better than houston and utah  who cares what experts thinks fact is we beat houston
hookem5746::Just informing the manic blazers fan so he doesn't dive into a deep depression if they don't make it.
dspdevildog::Experts?  Hollinger is one person I thought.
hookem5746::See other power rankings; other analysts.
Bowlingsuxs::hollinger says thunder can still go 71-11 even tho they have 12 losses right now
hookem5746::It's called updating information delay
ensign.devyn::They have the toughest schedule remaining. They won't be making it. It will be Utah for sure, and most likely Houston. With Utah's schedule, if LA catches anyone, it'll be Houston
Grantox::thats if mo comes back soon tinsley is killing us! and we need jefferson to leave
ensign.devyn::I don't think so either. Jazz could really get to the 6th or 5th if either GS or Denver comes back down a little bit.
mikeisildur::Relax, L.A.'s not catching anyone.  It will ruin all my lulz this season if they do.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::If Hollinger says it, then I'm inclined to believe the opposite.
LeBron is my Grandson -Greg Oden::i own lillard on 2k. he is my backup. i average 42 pts, 15 asts, 7 rebs, 3 stls and 1 blk. BEAST!
ensign.devyn::12 minute quarters in video games are great, huh?
ensign.devyn::You're not over 16, are you?
LeBron is my Grandson -Greg Oden::trying to set up my teammates and play some realistic basketball (I still fail doing that)
ensign.devyn::Still way too much. You should be scoring over 150 every game. And bump the difficult up
dspdevildog::Nothing like 15 in Madden
LeBron is my Grandson -Greg Oden::10 minutes
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I put myself into the game and average way better. You're playing it wrong.
mikeisildur::Dear Gordon,  I know you're enjoying your break, playing Starcraft and League of Legends. Please get well soon, the Jazz are pretty bad without you.  Sincerely,  Everyone
Grantox::ahahahhaha love it!
Grantox::fyi jazz haters. jazz played 17 at home 24 on road at mid season mark. still above 500 they are a horrible road team and still played good. well 24 at home and 17 on road last half of season and that spells roughly 48 wins goood enough for playoffs
legend_jr27::Had them going 14-6 (min) and 4-12 on the road before this 2 game set based on their schedule. Good enough for 43-39 and the 8th seed. Lakers would need to get to 44 wins (23-12) to get in and thats not going to happen.
Grantox::hope you are right!
Grantox::thats if they go 22-12  the last 34 games!
Grantox::20-14 is more like it so 46 wins will still get playoff s
ClydeTheGlide_22::Wow when was the last time we had a bench player score in double figures? Nice Nolan smith!
ensign.devyn::Seeing as how your bench avg's 16 pts a game, probably never.
van.muhle::I'm Tyrone Corbin. People seem to like me because I am polite and I am rarely late. I like to eat ice cream and I really enjoy a nice pair of slacks. Years later, a doctor will tell me that I have an I.Q. of 48 and am what some people call mentally re.tar.ted
ensign.devyn::...I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!
van.muhle::I ate a big red candle
ensign.devyn::I also love Lamp.
vegasbuster10::Jazz fans are you still talking about potential? Gtfoh Jefferson is a journeymen....milsap isn't even a starter...favors sucks and kanter can't even speak English....face it ur team sucks
vegasbuster10::Can you please tell me what part of my post was a lie? Jefferson will be on his 4the team soon.....milsap is not a starter in the NBA....favors is a career back up post player...and kanter sounds like the Russian from rocky
Francis4345::Can u tell me where i can find some stuff you smoking?
van.muhle::trollin hard
mikeisildur::Actually I don't think any Jazz fans have even used the word "potential" recently.  Good try though.
ensign.devyn::I've heard a lot of one's basketball skill is directly determined by the languages you can speak
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I'd love to see you say anything to Kanter's face
drpeppersonz::this jazz team aint makin the playoffs with this starting roster.  Lakers or Portand pass them up...maybe even both.
ClydeTheGlide_22::I agree with the part about Portland, but the Fakers are a joke of a team and are not making the playoffs.
hookem5746::Hollinger playoff odds:  Golden St: 95.1%.      29-17 Houston: 81.8%.        26-23 Utah: 54.1%.               26-22 Lakers: 32.4%.            21-26 Dallas: 19.7%.             20-27 Portland: 18.3%.          24-23  PORTLAND GOING NOWHERE
Grantox::if the jazz wise up and trade jefferson they can make a run in the playoffs
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Portland is going to drop soon and hard. Their schedule gets far tougher to end it. Jazz's gets easier.
ensign.devyn::Totally, since Portland has the hardest schedule left and LA hasn't shown any signs of consistency, and the Jazz have a very favorable schedule left.
mikeisildur::Neither.  The Jazz are mediocre, both the Lakers and Portland are bad teams.
ensign.devyn::Keep telling yourself that
drpeppersonz::Portland is young and getting better...and the Lakers have simply underachieved.
Rip City Forever::Ensign don't leave the jealousy over take you! You know as well as I do that the blazers are the sh-it, and the jazz have never done anything and probably never will. Good luck though, you will need it in the upcoming years ;)
hookem5746::Why do people predict the mavericks and lakers to finish ahead of Portland if you are so great???
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::The only team to go to more playoff appearances in a row and win nothing are the Blazers. LOL.
Grantox::worst blazers fan ever!^
ensign.devyn::Jazz are in 7 spot, Blazers are in 9th, we have a favorable schedule left, you don't... Mmmkay?
hookem5746::Hollinger playoff odds:  Golden St: 95.1%.     29-17 Houston: 81.8%.        26-23 Utah: 54.1%.             26-22 Lakers: 32.4%.          21-26 Dallas: 19.7%.           20-27 Portland: 18.3%.        24-23
Nate Covey::Who says we get rid of Ty corbutt
Grantox::can you do that for us? what do you charge? we can all chip in!
Grantox::can you take jefferson down too?
ghettoslider::portland hits 6 more ft's than the jazz and they win by 6.. interesting
rentasquid::Is there an NBA rule that says your team must be allowed to shoot the same number of free throws as the opposing team?  I thought the team that fouls the most stands along the key and watches the other team shoot.
van.muhle::Anyone know when Mo is due back?
Grantox::prob first week in march! cant come soon enough tho
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::They are re-evaluating him at the All-Star break.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Just for sh¡ts and giggles, Jazz are the 12th oldest team in the league. Raja Bell is still counted against that as well. Scratch him, they are 16th with an average age of 26. That still includes Tinsley and Watson.
Francis4345::Bell and Watson for sure. I'm still thinking Tinsley could help
mikeisildur::Bell, Tinsley, and Watson should all be let go of by next season.
van.muhle::And the truth will set you free
ensign.devyn::And then you compare playing time when all rosters are healthy, and that goes down even further...
Rip City Forever::If you wanna be a bandwagon fan, hop on the blazer bandwagon because we're heading back to greatness!
ensign.devyn::9th seed?
hookem5746::Rip City Forever - 2nd-4th seed next season!  Who are you adding to the team for that???
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::LOL. One thing at a time mojambo. Make the playoffs first.
ensign.devyn::^LOL. Maybe of the bottom 7 teams in the West.
Rip City Forever::2nd-4th seed next season!
hookem5746::Who is worse,Utah or Portland??  I see one of them as the 8th seed and one not making it.
Grantox::honestly the jazz have a good schedule this montha dn should be 6th or 7 th seed  at end of season.
hookem5746::So Jazz 7 and Rockets 8??
mikeisildur::Yeah, or vice versa.  Depends on whether the Jazz stumble or not.
Francis4345::Way tougher schedule for Portland
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Portland won't make it. Jazz will finish 7th. 6th if they get some lucky breaks.
mikeisildur::Portland's not making it.
Nate Covey::Yeah too streaky
Nate Covey::I swear every jazz game comes down to the last minute.
Grantox::yeah and who is it that causes it! al jeffersons shittty D
OregonLou::Why is Batum such a big Bagina??  He needs to hit the weight room, maybe work out with LeBron or something....If he was more aggressive he'd be a superstar.
ThinYellowLine::Plays the Silk Wilkes game.
Serg Abaka::Get him on the HGH?
vegasbuster10::Utah jazz might be the worst coached team in the NBA....Utah won't be any good till they fire this bum of a coach
van.muhle::never mind :)
ensign.devyn::Sacramento is, hands down
Grantox::agreed with sac. but jazz are close! jazz have more talent than sac so thats the diff
Serg Abaka::Got at least another year of him
Grantox::not if they fire him! i wish sloan would beg for his job back and get corbin canned
mikeisildur::I think they should just start having fan auditions for the position at home games.  Couldn't be any worse.
Mittens___the cat::Blazers better get that lube, cause the Wolves going to whop that as.s. We on that one game win streaking fools!!! GO Wolves!!!
Serg Abaka::Does anyone want to try and give a good reason why Jefferson/Tinsley were on the floor on that play where Marvin fouled?
Grantox::ummm i know this one
ensign.devyn::i rescind
Nate Covey::Talk about ref favoring
Francis4345::Just gave some hope to those Blazers fans... we go back home and we played more games on the road.
drpeppersonz::As old as the Jazz are, this is their ceiling.
Francis4345::You talk about Watson and Tinsley? Or Favor, Kanter, Burks ?
Grantox::you are so dumb! they ahave like 2 players over 30 and like 6 under 24
van.muhle::Reload and try again
ensign.devyn::Old? Favors, Kanter, Burks, Marvin, Al, Paul, Gordon, Demarre...
ensign.devyn::Yes, al and Paul are bench players, as is Marvin, and Gordon plays a ton of minutes...
drpeppersonz::bench players?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Old?
van.muhle::They are all under 28, let more oxygen reach your brain next time
ensign.devyn::I think there are lots of teams that win with an entire roster under 5 years in the league
drpeppersonz::Jefferson.  Moe Williams.  Randy Foye.   even Marvin and Millsap are 5+ year veterans.  they should be winning that old.
ensign.devyn::Refs really Billupsed us
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::LOL.
OregonLou::Wow, I just noticed the game was on Channel 8 !  I got to see that last 15 seconds.
