YimingF::yesterday was heart breaking, tonight was just a huge headache. We need to rebound balls to win game. The Grizz's is a good team that we can't match up against. Anyway, time to regroups and on to the next game. Warriorsfan4life here!!!
TP::Curry played, thus Conley shot 9/11, while Curry got 22 points, but after chucking up 18 shots with many of them bad shot attempts and wasted possessions. This guy certainly is the future foundation of the Warriors.
Micah::Go Warriors
No_Rain_Check::Memphis got their hands full this coming Monday night.
Jake VH 2012::Well well back to back #$%$ whuppings gotta love that. No defense. No championships
Frank::Bogut and O'Neil combined for 8 rebounds and 1 for 8 shooting.  They are not going to beat anyone with inside presence like that.
Anton::Conley showing Curry who is the better PG.
Glen::Warriors have lost at Clippers, at Spurs, and now at Memphis.  Pretty much the 3 top teams in the West.  It's hard to win road games early.
Jason::The season is still early, but it seems like the W's are not quite there yet.
Bob::Miami is going to wish they had M Miller back. Does a lot of little things well.
