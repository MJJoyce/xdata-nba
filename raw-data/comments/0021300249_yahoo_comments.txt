bgood2life::The Pacers are making teams adjust to their style of play, so far this season. While it is not impossible for teams to make adjustments,the problems the Pacers impose on other teams,are their will to play team and individual defense. By the way,i do mean relentless defense.
Francis::I think that it should have been on TV.  Now all you non believers can talk about the PACERS all you want.  Great road win for  Indiana.
Homer Fudd Jr.::CP3 better get a title before he's ready for the glue factory!
Clipperdude::Bullock is feeling it, needs to finish out this game. He also needs more time and experience with the first unit for later in the year.
Clipperdude::The Clippers best hope is to really push the pace against Indy's second unit and try to get to the line.
Commenter::Jamal Crawford scores 20 and a +/- + its time to bench J.J. littledick.
Chris::I must admit..the pacers are doing excellent, not good, not very good, EXCELLENT. I'm a Knicks fan and I'm giving them props. Like Nathan said, any team that goes 16-1 gets the upmost respect.
Homey D Clown::The Pacers will crush the crappers and only leave skid marks left of them.
Rodney::The Western Conference rules.  Clips got this.
MIKE THE ECONOMIST::If Danny Granger can come back, knock off some rust before playoff time, Pacers have a legit shot at the title.
