Jrange378::Pistons lost this game. Charlotte looked awful even in victory.
AGirlThatLovesSports_::oh.
smackdab0::I did one too. http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine
TigerMichLion111::ivleaguelawn I say Noel or zeller 31 Minutes Ago  That's just stupid, noel and zeller are both overrated, they're average players in the NBA, Shabazz has absolutely WAYY more potential, and will be a star, Noel just isn't that good right now and doesn't seem that special, Shabazz will average 20+ per game in the NBA by his 2nd or 3rd year
smackdab0::Noel is NBA ready, he's going to break Rondo's single season record for steals at UK this year. And he's no slouch with blocks either. He will go #1 overall though, so there's no worry about us getting him. A team can never have too much mean mugging defensive guys, you can always find a scorer. But defensively specialist are just that, special. You play defense right and it leads to offense
Afghanwhig78::Good to know we're terrible enough to choke against the Bobcats, but good enough to screw ourselves out of a top 5 pick.   #mediocre4life
Jrange378::We got a star in Drummond with the 8th pick fool.
Paul78655::We got LUCKY and landed Drummond. Thank Espn and the "experts" for killing his stock and creating what could be the best big in the game by '15
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::You don't have to be terrible to "choke" against the Bobcats. You're not the only team that's done it. And FAR BETTER teams have lost to the Cats.
Paul78655::Thank Frank for that. He should be canned by the all star break. How this guy got lumped into the same category as Tom Thibideau as far as defensive minded geniuses is anybodies guess.
bridgerj89::What a demeaning title. It's true, but why say it like that. They went on a very rough stretch against a tough core of teams. They could have won 5 or 6 games during that stretch but couldn't close. The Bobcats are still one of the youngest teams in the NBA and have by far the youngest talent core in the NBA (MKG, Biyombo and Kemba have an average age of 20.3). ESPN is trying to make the Bobcats the butt of every joke when they are on pace to more than double their win total from last season (even considering last year's 58 game season) and there are 3 teams with a worse record. It's not much, but it's definitely improvement. Charlotte has a great core to build around and will be respectable in 2 or 3 years and maybe more with good personnel moves over the next few years.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Constantly disrespected by the clowns on ESPN. That's fine though. Could be on a 3 game win streak had Kyrie Irving not decided to go nuts, but after 18 straight, I'll take it. Games like this get me super excited about the core of Kemba-Biz-and MKG. 17 boards by Biz. Wow. I really don't get all of the Henderson hate. You guys must've not been watching the Chicago or Cleveland games. Although I understand he might be traded, whats up with all the what have you done for me lately?
ivleaguelawn::Jordan still sells 200$ shoes, you think he cares or will ever go broke?
Paul78655::Not as much as youd think. Im not finding any info on what he makes from Nike, but he grosses 1 billion annually for them. Id say he makes roughly 20 cents per dollar, if that. Alot of his worth comes from like 10 other endorsement deals. And yes, I think it DOES matter. The guy was the most ruthlessly cold blooded player to ever play the game, and he THRIVED on beating his opponent into the ground. Id say it means the world to a guy like that.
Paul78655::ESPN likes to destroy the image of Jordan to better their total marketing bananza that is LeBron James.
itstrueidontcarewhatyousay::2 wins in 21 games, now they're starting to put it all together!
Le Asterisk::should be able to beat 9-73.  Whew!
KevinOllieSaves::top performer should be Kemba
pmr04002::UCONN
yourteamisokk::5 with adrian
BearJWS::Either way it's a UConn guy!  4 in this game!
cheis65::It looks like we are going to get porland's pick in the draft so what looks better  1.Noel or Zeller and Mccollum 2.Noel or zeller and Smart 3.Muhammad or McLemore or Goodwin and Plumlee 4.Muhammad or McLemore or Goodwin and McAdoo  I know Goodwins numbers isn't better than Muhammad or McLemore  but for some reason i like him better
ivleaguelawn::I say Noel or zeller
cheis65::And Muhammad has no defense in all his games this year he only has 5 steals and 0 blocks
cheis65::Henderson for Hickson?  And Hickson is only 24
bamberg1977::Wish Rudy Gay was a better shooter. Pistons have pieces to trade for the tax-strapped Grizz, like Tay and Stuckey. But I dont know he makes a team much better, I think its mostly Gasol and Randolph.
trademarktaz::MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00 - Why tank? This draft sucks. Let Charlotte have our pick this year so that way we don't have to give it to them when the draft is actually good.  The only way Charlotte gets our pick in this draft is if the Pistons make the playoffs, which is pretty much not going to happen so we'll be keeping this year's pick. If you think this draft sucks then you should check it again because there's plenty of great players but the Pistons are committed to playing themselves out of the top 5. Next year's draft will be even better but Charlotte gets that pick unless the Pistons suck again next season and miss the playoffs.
t casey::Letting Afflalo go still hurts to this day. He was the more impressive player in almost every way when we let him go, but for some reason Joe D was completely sold on Stuckey and that hasn't really panned out well yet. Although, I wouldn't be against re-inserting Stuckey into the starting lineup atm. He's been playing much better lately while Singler's really been struggling lately.
bamberg1977::Pistons need a legit SG, how many have we gone through? Rip, Iverson, Stuckey, Afflalo, Ben Gordon... can't believe we need one, but we do. Crazy Rip was the only good one while he was here because he didnt need ball to score and shot a solid % and could still get assists off 2 dribble moves and we just ran offense. Everyone else needs to pound the rock.. except Afflalo... looks like a big mistake trading him instead of Stuckey.
BearJWS::Too many combo guards on the Pistons!  They really need a leader, a PG who can take charge.  They should have taken Kemba last year, instead of Knight.
Steveforprez04::Potential ECF matchup
Roweey::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=au99esf Fair Trade lol?
arrogantespncommenter9::ESPN makes small market teams look bad and makes excuses for overrated big market teams.
Paul78655::They also over exploit and try to market players.
Makaveli_Better_Dayz::Nice win by the Bobcats. Hopefully one of many to come ...
AvengedByCats::Wow, that title. Not "2nd win in 3 games," no, it's "2nd in 21!" Whatever sells, right ESPN?
LiveAtTheHive88::gotta be as optimistic as possible during these times Cats
cmbates92::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=akh52ja  Lol a Bobcat fans dream. Lol it will never happen. At least my dream. G-Force to the Charlotte Bobcats!
cmbates92::Hahahaha i agree, it was fun.
Kujosh54321::Alright I'm off. This was a fun, insanely long topic lol
Kujosh54321::I know it would never happen, but they should trade for curry.
Kujosh54321::Yea true, I wouldn't want to lose him either
cmbates92::Don't want to lose Kemba though. Only way Golden State does it.
Kujosh54321::He could be a SG
cmbates92::Lol it could happen, but we would lose Kemba.
LiveAtTheHive88::well done cmbates.  BCats need to bring in some new talent like this soon
LiveAtTheHive88::ha we could always sneak them in a multi-team mega trade and benefit the most... ex: Denver Nuggets
Kujosh54321::I'm gonna wait to judge him during the playoffs. He was an all star last year, so I'm sure they value him heavily.
cmbates92::He's not playing too well with that team.
Kujosh54321::Possible, but iggy is probably worth more.
cmbates92::Not even with a pick or 2?
Kujosh54321::Not bad. Denver would never agree to that though.
cmbates92::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=a2z3end Anything?
cmbates92::Hold on give me a second. I might have found something.
LiveAtTheHive88::bats.  Well hopefully the front office comes up with something before the deadline.  But we can both agree... Henderson and Mullens gotta go
cmbates92::Lol that would cause us to give up Kemba, MKG, or Biyombo.
LiveAtTheHive88::no no no man WE have gotta be the ones that end up with JJ Barea and Rudy Gay!
cmbates92::Ive tried a bunch of those. This is the best I could come up with that was good for all teams involved. http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=azrgnh4
LiveAtTheHive88::Good point.  Maybe it'd be cool to have him back.  I'd just like to see the BCats get more out of a trade involving Henderson and Mullens than G Force
cmbates92::They are both a risk. Our main weakness right now is defense. Whoever fits that bill the best would be my choice. I like both of those guys.
MasterIchiro::I would much rather have Derek Williams.
cmbates92::I agree with that, but the best I can see is Hendo for Derrick Williams. Not many people will give something good for them.
LiveAtTheHive88::I hear where you're coming from man.  I'd love to have him back, but when I see him I just remember mediocracy, his humiliating performance in the dunk contest, and the playoff sweep.  Ben Gordon is a fantastic veteran leader in my opinion and it's time to let go and start a new era.
cmbates92::Because we had crap front office that didnt get him any help to be here long enough. Most of the help we had was here less than three years. We have close to what we need now.
cmbates92::We have a lot better players now then when we did when he was here last. These guys actually want to win and play together. We miss his leadership, he gave his all every night!
cmbates92::We are better without Hendo and Mullins.
Kujosh54321::I agree with you. Wallace definitely brought an intangible aspect when he was here. But it's not time to throw away assets so that we can win a few right now.
cmbates92::People underestimate the power of the emotional part of the game. Wallace gave that to us like no one else has.
Kujosh54321::We have many players under 23. By the time those players are in their prime, Wallace will be ready to retire.
cmbates92::Most were here less than 3 years. We have the front office to keep this in contact now. What people dont realize is this is different now. You let all the guys grow together we have a shot. He was and still could be our leader. The guys we have now are actually wanting to work hard get better and win. Wallace and Jack were the only ones who played like that here.
LiveAtTheHive88::not true... during his time here he got to play with Raymond Felton, Tyson Chandler, Emeka Okafor, DJ Augustin, Jason Richardson, Boris Diaw, Raja Bell, Shannon Brown and some other talented players.  None of them could seem to put it together while they were here though and because of the lack of winning, Wallace is now a thing of the past.
Kujosh54321::No, we shouldn't be trading for players over 30
cmbates92::Yeah but we are one or two pieces away from being extremely competitive!
cmbates92::We didnt have anyone then really. Him and Jack, that was it.
LiveAtTheHive88::one or two superstars maybe... not injury prone 30 year olds who had his chance here and only led us to a first round sweep
gcburns::Yeah isnt MKG similar to him
cmbates92::Thats the point. Have MKG learn from him.
LiveAtTheHive88::I love G-Force but we got rid of him because it was time to start over... sorry man but we gotta stick with that!
DeeetroitBasketball2013::This Chicago fan is ridiculous. Some of the things coming out of his mouth are psychotic. He needs counseling. As most Chicago fans do.
JimDetroitFan95::I told everyone to ignore him, didn't I?  I know real fans from Chicago......
JimDetroitFan95::People with January sign ins are suspect imo........
DeeetroitBasketball2013::I know fans in Chicago too. I grew up there. They are all ignorant there.
DeeetroitBasketball2013::Everyone is ignoring him because he is mentally unfit! Some of the things he was saying down there is just creepy. Bulls will get what they deserve soon.
DeeetroitBasketball2013::He will have knee problems for the rest of his career for sure.
Sir Faps Alot.::hopefully another drose acl tear
Sir Faps Alot.::pay no attention to him hawkeytown sounds better doesnt know s.hit about sports
Sir Faps Alot.::pay no attention to him hawkeytown sounds better doesnt know s.hit about sports
Rutro Rowdy::m
MasterIchiro::I would like to dump Henderson, sell Sessions high and sell Gordon high and tank even worse so we can draft Shabazz Muhhamad.  Maybe we can score enough picks to bundle with Biz and the POR and DET picks and get someone like Cousins.  You can't tell me Biz plus 3 or 4 first round picks does not pry away Cousins.
MasterIchiro::I like Mclemore as well.
cmbates92::Ummmmmmmmmmmm no. Bobcats are good with the guys we have now. One or two more pieces and we are good.
cmbates92::These guys are improving. They arnt at their max yet.
MasterIchiro::What?  We are the 4th worst team in the NBA and the Cavs are much better now with Irving back and the Hornets with E. Gordon back.
Kujosh54321::I like Ben Mclemore, and Alex Len
cmbates92::I like both of those guys too.
JimDetroitFan95::The Pistons lost this game.   Period.  The Bobcats played hard, and earned the win.  That being said, I challenge you Pistons fans to watch hockey once it starts.  I love it, and hockey is a great sport.  Give it a chance.
Afghanwhig78::There's no shortage of Red Wings love in Detroit.  The past few years have been disappointing, and yet another work stoppage has dampened things, but I think the Pistons need more love than the Red Wings.  In San Diego, I see Red Wings jerseys whenever I attend any hockey games in SoCal.  Not so much with the pissed ons.
gcburns::Its almost too hit or miss to me. The bounce of the puck in hockey every game seems a toss up. I guess thats exciting in a way. Its hard to follow, you see all this puck control and good shots and then the in a flash the other team scores some flash fluke goal. Feels empty.
Hawkeytown_Sounds_Better::BLAH BLAH BLAH!  do you just stay on here and complain how the pistons suck? get a life
DeeetroitBasketball2013::Just ignore him. He comes from the cesspool of Chicago.
Sir Faps Alot.::good team???
DeeetroitBasketball2013::Whatever dude.
Hawkeytown_Sounds_Better::Your just mad I have a good team.
Sir Faps Alot.::coming from the guy who is not a pistons or bobcats fan and is trolling
Sir Faps Alot.::to many strikes to often and they lost their fan base. i stopped watching on the last strike
LiveAtTheHive88::Hopefully the clock strikes midnight on Henderson soon. That guy disrupts everything for the BCats.  He's gotta go
LiveAtTheHive88::why not send Mullens too and get more... I'd like to see more nights like this one from Biz
gcburns::Will trade him for Stuckey. He is same for Pistons. At least we can comfortably bench Henderson and lock away the key. Stuckey is more talented, but man he just doesnt fit in a 5 on 5 game. Even when he has decent shooting games it just feels like our O is cold when he's out ther.
Miami-cHeat::What are the Pistons management doing? Free Dre Drum!
Hawkeytown_Sounds_Better::wHAT?
Kujosh54321::Great close win! I think it is inevitable that Henderson will be traded. They are simply better when hendo isn't on the floor. Drummond is a future stud but don't be upset that he's not starting. The dude is 19 and very raw. Good luck for the rest of the season piston fans. I will be pulling for you guys for selfish reasons.
Kujosh54321::Protected det draft pick
gcburns::What are selfish reasons?
stevestap::Charlotte fans, forget about getting cousins. Kings say he is untouchable so stop doing your unrealistic trades where you get cousins dumbas.ses
Kujosh54321::We already have one head case in Tyrus Thomas. Don't want him.
LiveAtTheHive88::we don't want Cousins.  We just want to get rid of Gerald Henderson.
Hondo Kid::Lebron played 35 min tonight and got his zero in the boxscore.  Yep no fouls.  How cool is he.  Wow.  Oh wait.. I forgot.. lebron already got called for his one foul for this season.  My bad.  Nevermind.  Maybe next year he can do better.

Kobrick Byrant Greatest Shot Chucker of All Time::my moms dead bro. so besides being a creapy mother fu.cker you like to f.uck with dead bodies??
The BatCam::In a trade for Cousins I would label Kemba, MKG, Biz, and OUR first round pick as all untouchable. Anything else is on the board. I would think a trade of Hendo, one of the other first round picks and maybe another player such as Sessions or Mullens could swing the deal. Especially if we took on big contract like Chuck Hayes
stevestap::THe kings would never agree to that. I live in sac. Cousins is not going anywhere! He's a different person since being suspended and "has a new mindset". Who knows how long it lasts but it would take more than a lot to get cousins. Henderson, a first rounder, and Mullins is not even close to what the kings want!
LiveAtTheHive88::As a Cats fan, I really really don't like Henderson.  We are a better team without him or when he's in a limited role like tonight.
mdfrg::we are obviously better without Mulley and Hendo
mdfrg::kings will never agree to this
LiveAtTheHive88::I like it!  Do you think Cousins would do well in Charlotte though?

This one, our effort was pitiful. Cant blame injuries on every loss . If you watched the game, the Bobcats showed more heart going after offensive boards, loose balls, and forcing fouls
Afghanwhig78::If the Bulls can't win without D-Rose, they have depth problems one star can't erase.  Sort of like the Cavs when they have LeBron.
