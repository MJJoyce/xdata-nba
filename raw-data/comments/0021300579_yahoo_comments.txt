Johnathan::We'll see if Joe Johnson can keep this up in the postseason--IF the Nets get there.  From a Hawks perspective, this is a bad loss amongst several others when they have faced off against sub-.500 teams.  The 3 that jump out at me right now are...  Brooklyn (currently 16-22; 2-0 vs. ATL) New York (currently 15-24; 2-1 vs. ATL) Orlando (currently 10-29; 2-1 vs. ATL)  There are plenty of others, but these three in particular alarm me. As bad as these three teams have looked early, somehow we've gone 2-6 against them?  That's not acceptable.   I don't know if it's bad coaching, lack of energy from the players, or what have you, but it's time to get it in gear and start playing some better basketball, be it improving on defense, limiting turnovers, I don't care...it's January and we look like we're playing in the f***in' preseason!
PKM::Nets will be a tough out in the playoffs, hopefully they get Miami and not the Pacers.
zZzZ::What's up with Lou Williams this season? Shelvin Mack is doing better than he is.
RC::in the past when horford was injured, the hawks could weather the storm by everybody scoring a little more and josh smith helping to hold it down on the defensive end. now there are no answers in the post...garnett and blatche scored whenever they wanted..
KUSH MASTER::LOL..After the 3, they took Korver out right away.
Commish O::Blatche is a really underrated player... they need to give him much more run!  Especially with all those old hurt players.  C'mon Kidd!  When Blatche gets starting minutes, he's an 18 and 8 big man!  C'mon Brooklyn!
Plain Truth::The Nets should move to London.
Don::uh oh korver 3 pt streak on the line...not friendly rims in  London?
sparks82::I have a better question , why are they playing a  3PM game on a Thursday ?
JoshM::Fantasy question... Trade was proposed to me  Anthony Davis(my player) for Lebron James. Roto league. What do you all think?Thanks
