Chris M::wait til CJ returns and the new guys continue to gel - blazers are going to be a tough out every night.  I said it during free agency - blazers will be about a 6 seed, maybe 4 or 5.
Sarah Jane Amper::First round picks in 2016~18 from nets will be exciting for boston... nets are not going anywhere!
Jack Rowland::Celtics just HAVE to start rebounding on the OFFENSIVE board if they want to score more AND win more games. Lack of offensive rebounds has been their problems for past few years and they WILL NOT win many games unless they correct the problem. One would think the coaches, ex players or someone could see this and do SOMETHING!!
Alfons O::Seems like when Sullinger goes in the Celtics go on a run. I am biased but sure looks that way.
1blazermaniac4ever::Rip City Baby!!! Good job Aldridge,on your 1st win in Boston!
Park Zin::Rip city, rebuilding team, w/ complete caliber player,. poor boston,.
BigBear::Bass -22 , Green -15, and Humphries still gets zero minutes while youngsters Olynyk gets only 16 and Vitor only 15 . Who's kidding who ? Ainge & Stevens don't want to win as Bass & Green can't carry Humphries jock.
John::Omer Asik wants out of Houston go after him.
Matt C::That's it... Lose out and get that lottery pick. 4 wins is enough for me. Ainge may need to deal some talent to get there though, as there's no way Brad Stevens and those players will throw in the towel like they need to. Celtic Pride's gonna lead to an 8-seed and a one-and-done if they're not careful, and that's the last thing we want. What was the late Al Davis' mantra? Just Lose, Baby!
scotty::As a Celtic fan I couldn't agree with you more.
