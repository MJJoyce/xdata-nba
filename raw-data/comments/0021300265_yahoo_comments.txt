Darren L::John Hollinger runs that team now, and simply put, he's an advanced metrics guy.  OJ & Rudy have horrible advanced metrics across the board.  He believed their spots could be filled with a platoon of guys like Tayshuan, Mike Miller, Bayless, and a handful of fresh bodies with unfamiliar house hold names - at a fraction of the salary cost
gary::The Suns were a major embarrassment for the second game in a row. No hustle, no offense, no defense and they acted like they didn't want to play. You are professionals, play like it.
donald::The entire city of Denver and large sections of the state of Colorado are demanding to know the reasons why Javale was given an insane contract and Koufos was sent packing.  People will be held accountable.
abraham::noobs.. rudy gay didn't get along with the team all the players wanted him out...
Terry::29 three pointer attempts!  no wonder Phoenix lost.  They didn't even try to work a shot, what the hell happened?  I don't thin there should be an assist given for a 3 point attempt.  Whatever happened to defense?
clint::Those Plumlee brothers are not flashy but fundamentally sound.
Bobby::The Suns coached himself to defeat...37 insecond half
Brian::Garbage Time!
fup duck::FINALLY, Jamal Franklin
E::True. @reddyteddy. Wonder how J Timberlake feels...?
