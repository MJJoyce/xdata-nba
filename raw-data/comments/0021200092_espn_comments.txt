LBJisnoMJ::hey Miami Phil Jackson is available
Shareef1987::Correct me if I'm wrong but Miami has been blown out a few times in the last 2 years and what effect did that have on the Playoffs...nothing.
KnixTix::This is a new year.  Last year you played D...this year you are NOT.  Everybody scores 100+ on you.  Wade is becoming useless.  You have no interior presence.  This is not a shortened season. LBJ will wear down b/c he had no time off since the lockout.  SO, DON'T EXPECT THE SAME RESULTS!!!
Miami Heat Are Number 1::the defense needs to pick because right now were not looking to good at all
Kit Ramsey::The Heat aren't going back to back, u can book that. Lebron is going to wear down by allstar break because of too much basketball, last years condensed season, long NBA PLAYOFFS and straight to the Olympics and then right into the 82 game season, don't be surprised if he gets a major injury. Not hating, just saying.
KnixTix::Excellent points.  Also, they're letting everybody score 100+ on them.  Where's the defense????
balltillifall_88::i hated to see mayo go, but i think replacing him with bayless and ellington will make us a much better team. we are deeper at point guard now than we have been. and i love bayless' mentality and passion. he fits in with the grizzlies perfectly. and i was a little doubtful on ellington at first, and i know he isnt going to have games like this every night, but he is winning me over.  he has been playing hard and shooting great. he has also adopted the grizzlies grit and grind attitude. and now we have some much needed 3 point shooting. and we will be even better when arthur gets back. as long as hollins can find him some decent minutes with the way speights has played.
lebron-is-a-champion::okay, okay grizzlies fans... chill out. just because you won this game doesnt mean your automatically going to the finals. dont forget you have OKC, san antonio, and the lakers in your conference
KnixTix::Heat fans excuses are really, really getting old.   They won't admit when they get their ButtsKicked. Always talking about last season...it's a new day. And you WILL NOT REPEAT!
ELOWK::Thats right and your conference is SOFT as doctors cotton ... so we actually have to work to get to the finals... you got teams taking you to 7 games that have old men on their team and nobodies... year of the Griz watch... if the Floppers didn't get so many calls like the Heat still did in this game we'd have been going to the West Conf finals last year... but can't control the refs ... just like they were trying to make it a close game last night w/ all the bs fouls on the Griz but didn't call it the same the other way and we were at home..... Heat got put out fellas
balltillifall_88::im not gonna guarantee my grizz will make it to the finals. but they have a hell of a chance. and no, not JUST because they beat the heat wire to wire (again), but because they are very good. they can play big or play small. they can play in transition or in half court. they force turnovers like crazy. they are capable of beating any team in the nba on any given night. plus they aided their only weakness, 3 point shooting.
RUMBLEizmyWINGMAN::bringing em back to reality!
lebron-is-a-champion::haha tell me about it
lebron-is-a-champion::gooo heat!! dont let this loss bring you down! LET'S GO HEAT!
balltillifall_88::second straight wire to wire win over the heat. and people still doubt the grizzlies. if we can stay healthy, i will be disappointed in seeing us in ANYTHING short of the conference finals.
ELOWK::what is this wire to wire mess... the Griz won by 18 points and thats AFTER the benches were emptied! twas not a close game
balltillifall_88::"wire to wire" means from tip off to the end. the grizzlies led the entire game. you are thinking of "down to the wire".
RUMBLEizmyWINGMAN::which you will lose to OKC!
balltillifall_88::thats true, but if you are gonna act like harden isnt an absolutely HUGE loss, then you are crazy lol.
RUMBLEizmyWINGMAN::haha.. keep thinking that.. remember.. we still have KD!
balltillifall_88::im sorry, but i dont think teams are afraid of OKC as they were. giving up harden was absolutely stupid. i dont care if it was a contract year. k-mart is a good scorer, but he isnt close to being the all around player and playmaker that harden is.
coltranesteelkirt::Lol... The Heat?!   What have you done for me lately?   I honestly would be fully shocked if they make the playoffs.... I can see them sneaking in with the 8th seed if they hire Mike Brown.
lebron-is-a-champion::hahahaha spoken by a cavs fan
ELOWK::i love all the heat fans and their excuses... we love how your fans walked out of our arena w/ half the 4th qtr left, love how W. Ellington put 25 up off the bench, love that block from J.Bayless to Ellington for the 3... oh yes and that sweet behind the back move and jam on lebron from Rudy!! You need a real BBall team to beat the griz! oh wait lets not forget Z-Bo has a double double in every game this year... and off to the best start 5-1 in franchise history... Choke on something heat fans!
Celticsox937::THERES ANOTHER CELTICS AND GRIZZ FAN ON ESPN??? Thought the day would never come
ELOWK::and Luis everything i said was fact so how am i delusional ... i was there... i watched all of it happen :) thanks good day.. maybe yall can beat one of those soft teams in the east to feel better
ELOWK::yup champs getting beat by the Grizzlies... hmmm whats that say... see ya in the Finals if you make it
lebron-is-a-champion::we still da champs sucka
luismourino::lol delusion hurts
kawhigotnext::Heat fans need to calm down, the heat are going to make the playoffs and they will probably be the 1 seed in a weak conference. Spo is taking a page out of pop's playbook and not forcing his stars to play too many minutes. Just wait and see how fresh the heat are in the playoffs.
Lebroncouldcareless::heat lost damn!!!!!!!  COWBOYS WONLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
vernon bates336::We have the deepest team in the West next to the Clipper.  I believe the first round lost to them last year will bode well for us this year.  We are a match-up nightmare because we can play you any way you want to play us.  Go small?  We'll take Gasol our and put in Speights.  We have a match-up for every position and tony Allen is the best perimeter defender in the NBA.  There is something great brewing in Memphis!  The NBA will soon recognize it.  Can't wait until we get Darrell Arthur back then we can rest Z-BO and Gasol at the same time.  Our Zoo Crew will be able to beat the Bobcats.  We will have Bayless,Poindexter,Ellington,Speights, and Arthur coming off the bench!   Watch out!
Danny_Brown_313_Detroit::i stopped at "tony allen is the best perimeter defender in the nba" LMFAOOOOOO... please tell me you are not serious??
FatCat_00::thats not crazy to people who watch basketball  and not just sportscenter
DanNYC2816::that is not a crazy thing to say at all
ccujav2108::Memphis has a DEEP team. What round did they go out last year in the Playoffs? Conference semis?
blue raider58::Grizz will win the west but will lose to the Heat in the Finals. In seven games that's right I said it!
MemphisTn7414::1st round against the Clippers. We took them all 7 games.
ULCard_194::lost to clippers in game 7 in 1st round
ccujav2108::Ahh right.
abdiraxman79::ha ha that's bad reporting, they called chris bosh a center in the story............
Jai22T::This what i've been talking about with Miami,can they win another chip playing small ball.Memphis a team with a soild frontcount and didnt let Miami beat them with the small ball..
ULCard_194::Memphis has a NBA team, and they are pretty damn good. they just beat the heat by 18 points. theyre only loss was an opening day close one @ the Clippers.   Grizz have a solid starting line up. Even with Arthor on the IR they have great depth. This team is a sleeper. This might be there year to contend for the West. They play OKC wed so we'll find out if they can hang with the "best in the west"
jpfarrell::Coach SPO knows what he has with his main pieces he had last year.  He's working in Ray Allen and Lewis to see what they're made of.  Mike Miller and Joel will see more PT when it counts.  They were both a big part of the 'Ship last year and they are both professionals and will be ready when they're asked to contribute.

CoconutFaninFlorida::Stupid Grizzlies fan alert!!
Dumb Heat fans::^  YEAAAH GRIZZLIES!!!
Danny_Brown_313_Detroit::the grizzlies always give the heat match up problems, it's not a good match up for the heat at all. They always lose to the grizzlies in the regular season. but you also have to put in account that most of the grizzlies and heat games are played early in the season, and when most players are still trying to get into regular season form, also dwade wasn't 100% this game.
balltillifall_88::the grizzlies give every team match up problems.
MemphisTn7414::Lol, grizzlie hater!
Dumb Heat fans::April 6 is early in the season huh (only game last year - grizzlies won)
Danny_Brown_313_Detroit::first year the big 3 played together, they lost to the grizzlies early in the season. and frankly, who cares about these early meaningless regular season games anyway? unless your a team struggling to make the playoffs, sure you should care about every win. but if you're the heat, you can be a damn 8th seed and probably still make it to the finals. good little confidence boost win for the grizzlies, but they aren't going anywhere in the playoffs. that's just life.

ELOWK::but we DO have a 5 game winning streak...
Dumb Heat fans::^
22KDALLTHEWAY35::GOOD USERNAME
MemphisTn7414::It will be Memphis vs Clippers at the 2013 championship!
KYRIEALLTHEWAY::YOU SOUND AND MOST LIKELY LOOK STUPID AF. THE CLIPPERS LOST TO THE CAVS   BBBBLLLLLOOOOOUUUUUSSSSSEEEEEEE
MemphisTn7414::I don't give a $@%!! It want be Miami!
ScarecrowKeyserSoze::Lol Fail.
nedg619::Like I said stop talking you sound stupid.
Reese38139::They're both in the Western Conference
cbbaseball19::Exactly
MemphisTn7414::Why u don't believe those 2 teams can't make it?
cbbaseball19::Someone is not very bright........
MemphisTn7414::Miami have a team full of superstars! Not just Lebron and Wade! Stop making excuses!
ELOWK::Rudy will be gone after this year if we dont get to the NBA Finals...
MemphisTn7414::Rudy Gay isn't a all star player!
nedg619::OMG HOW DO YOU LIKE MEMPHIS AND SAY MARC GASOL IS THE STAR. SO WHAT IS RUDY GAY?
MemphisTn7414::And how many stars is that? Vs Memphis only have 1 and that's Marc Gasol!
nedg619::Lebron, wade, Ray Allen, Bosh. just stop you sound stupid.
MemphisTn7414::That's all I hear Miami fans scream about a championship. How can Miami win another championship, when they can't beat a team like Memphis?
ELOWK::yeah, bye bye OJ Mayo, Hello Wayne Ellington... Even Conley got him a little 3 ptr going
MemphisTn7414::We was missing one thing and that was 3 point shooting but that's not a problem anymore!
MemphisTn7414::The Memphis Grizzlies is the most physical team in the league in the playoff.
balltillifall_88::just to be fair, it did get the grizz to 7 games and 4 overtimes against the thunder in the second round the year before last... without rudy gay... last year was a disappointment though. but thats what happens when you give up a 20+ point lead in the 4th quarter and lose game 1 against the clippers. but this year we will have rudy AND zach the FULL season for the first time in the last 3 years. the grizz are no joke.
ScarecrowKeyserSoze::How far did that get you the last 2 years?
D Wade Fan Since The 04-05 Season::Beating a team in the regular season does equate to guaranteed success against that team in the playoffs.
jpfarrell::Some people don't just get sarcasm.
MemphisTn7414::No matter if they never win a championship. I will always be a Memphis fan! I will always support my home team! I don't mess with no outside team! Real fan!
nedg619::says a lot about your team doesn't it. Does it make you feel better that your team hasn't won a championship?
MemphisTn7414::Why Miami Heat fans r sore losers? Miami just can't $@%! with Memphis!
MemphisTn7414::Miami is a 3 man show. U have to be a team to beat a team. Memphis plays great team ball!
KYRIEALLTHEWAY::THANKKYOU FOR SAYN THIS   BEAT THE HEAT
nedg619::Beat the Heat at home and ill agree with you.
Dumb Heat fans::LIKE LAST YEAR?
OBAMA 2016.::good job good effort grizzlies
nedg619::Miami is still an unhealthy team. And the grizzles are healthy and they were at home. Come on they still are not better than the heat. In march we will see at heats home.
MemphisTn7414::So, Miami just have to great players? What about Ray Allen? Shane Battier? Mike miller? What about those players?
nedg619::Lebron has a bad knee and Wade is ill thats why he didn't play last game and had such a quiet game yesterday.
Lugene Parker::Were still missing D Arthur.  We wont get him back till December 1st.  He's one of our primary bench players.
D Wade Fan Since The 04-05 Season::@nedg619  Wade 3-15  Ray 2-7 Chalmers 2-9  Cole 0-3  Haslem 1-3  Lewis 1-4  4-15 from three as a team  14 missed fts  Even if Wade had gone lets say 8-15 they still would have shot poorly as a team and loss this one. It had nothing to do with being unhealthy.
cbbaseball19::This is garbage.  They are fine, no excuses.  They got beat.
nedg619::Stop. If Memphis played a healthy Miami team in a 7 game series heat would win 4-2
Dumb Heat fans::^
MemphisTn7414::If we played against Miami in a championship, we would win!
nedg619::LeBron and Wade are both unhealthy. LOL how many championships does Memphis have?
cbbaseball19::Im a Miami fan. How are both of them unhealthy?
MemphisTn7414::Lol! Memphis won the last 7 of 10 games now against yo Heat!
cbbaseball19::Unhealthy??? Whos not healthy right now?
ChiTown All Day All Night::Grizzlies gunna have a great season!
ELOWK::whats the point in having 3 superstars on your team if you dont win it every year? shouldn't yall have won it the first year yall were together??? Griz get better every year... Perimeter shooting was our downfall last year so no worries ths year... Wayne Ellington 6th man of the year!
MemphisTn7414::Miami want win it this year!
nedg619::I'm guessing you were trying to say wont. SO who will?
cbbaseball19::"Miami want win it this year!"   Whats does this mean?
nedg619::Whats the point of having great season if your not going to win the championship.
tmoneyinmphs::Lebron wants to confiscate this video.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ2LHvIE1Qo
ELOWK::that was soooo nasty! i was at the game last night.... that whole series of plays was nasty... only thing heat could get on us was fast break points they have NO half court offense
cbbaseball19::I dont get why they say dunked on Lebron James.......  I didnt get to see this play but it looks like Gay was lucky to find that ball when he put it behind his back.  Looked like he lost it but found it and had an easy lane for a dunk
cbbaseball19::Haha get some Rudy Gay!
nba is the worst::Watch the clip - lebron throwing the elbow is what caused Rudy to get delayed on the behind his back play. And then there's the fist to the junk as shown in this pic:  http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/miamiheat/post/_/id/15769/prepared-for-uppercut-heat-get-jabbed
cbbaseball19::Cheap elbow???
nba is the worst::It's semantics. he was lebron's responsibility to guard - and it's just yet another example of how dirty the heat are across the board, with the cheap elbow from lebron
cbbaseball19::Yeah but when you get dunked on, its trying to block the guy from dunking. Its not standing at the free throw line while the guy throws it down.  Im not sticking up for Lebron, because if he got postered Id gladly admit it but this wasnt being dunked on.
nba is the worst::Because lebron was guarding him - or I should say "standing flat-footed and throwing the elbow at rudy as he went by"...
pedro 4 the marlins::14 missed free throws and 14 3's by the Grizz, hard to win games like that.
Dominic10002::Good job Grizz!!!
zoemarlin::This small line up may hurt the Heat in the long run...I know Joel Anthony is an offensive liability but his defense and shot blocking is very much needed
D Wade Fan Since The 04-05 Season::What the hell was Spo thinking in a game like this (especially with the team struggling to score). Joel needs to play against teams like this.
cbbaseball19::Joel looked awful the one game I saw him play.  They should let Jorts get some playing time against bigger teams
cbbaseball19::No not at all. I was just surprised.  Didnt know he played at all last night.
nba is the worst::You think I made those stats up?
cbbaseball19::I didnt see the end.  Jorts got some playing time?
nba is the worst::I saw him get some tick last night - 4 min 5 pts on 2 shots and 4 rebs, team-high +9.  Way better than "the warden"
Finding Bigfoot::With Gay and Z-bo healthy Memphis is a contender in the West and without them they are an 8 seed.
ELOWK::Rudy str8 as long as he is driving and cutting... he's normally not a 3pt shooter... hopefully we can get to the NBA finals so we keep the whole team together
cbbaseball19::Rudy Gay is a boss.  Drafted him two straight years for fantasy
KYRIEALLTHEWAY::I understand that they have more games to go but they could have easily won this game
KinickDiaz::And after all that the Original question is still without an answer...lol
KinickDiaz::And after all that .....The original question is still without an answer....lol
Eric Rothschild452::am i the only one who liked all these comments
KinickDiaz::Alright smart man let me ask you in simple layman terms:.... Do you think the Heat could have easily won this game?.... and if so ..what made you think so?......   Here is that better?................. and a quote from you:--------  This is a Heat Memphis board. Im a Heat fan on a public fan board. Why would a Knicks fan come over here.       See how dumb that sounds??...    you saying its a public board but asking why is a knick fan here.......CAUSE ITS A PUBLIC BOARD!!!!!!
cbbaseball19::The Heat brought the game within five points.  They could have won the game but they had an off shooting night.  To be within five points while shooting 38% Id say next time they play, Heat win.
KinickDiaz::Thats what u wanted all along cause your dumb a.ss  cant s.hut the f.uck up ........ youre the only one that had a problem with what i said...... see how stupid u are?
cbbaseball19::No, I guess I missed the point from an ignorant person.
KinickDiaz::Man u Dumb!!!!!.............. NOW ITS DIRECTED AT YOU!
cbbaseball19::See, just an ignorant New Yorker, whats new!
KinickDiaz::OMG!!! ... for the last time dude I asked kyrie "  why did he think the heat could have easily won the game?........ how the hell is that pumping my chest??? ...did i say anything about the knicks???..........whats your problem dude?
cbbaseball19::You coming in here calling people dumb. Whats that??
KinickDiaz::exactly so shut the F.uck up.... if u cld care less why respond??....to a question that didnt have s.hit to do with you!
cbbaseball19::Its a Heat Memphis board. Im a Heat fan on a public fan board.  Why would a Knicks fan come over here pumping their chests because they are 4-0 in the beginning of the season?
KinickDiaz::you Bootleg Heat Fans gave NEW meaning to the Term DBAG!!!
KinickDiaz::U Mad cause the knicks 4-0??? .....
cbbaseball19::Not mad at all.  its 4 games into the season for them.  i could care less what they do.
KinickDiaz::The Question wasn't even directed at u!!!!!! ..... $@%!
cbbaseball19::The point is you are being a dbag Knicks fan thinking your above everyone else.  Take your smartass back to the Knicks board.
KinickDiaz::U F.ucking Idiot !... i asked "how cld they have easily won the game"?......can u answer that??....
cbbaseball19::you put, and I quote, "man u Dumb!!!"  Just stick to the Knicks board
KinickDiaz::Win this Game?????  how exactly????.... man u Dumb!!!
cbbaseball19::Knicks fan riding the early season win streak of four games.  How cute
cbbaseball19::Not shooting 38% from the field.
cbbaseball19::Anyone want to buy assassins creed 3 off me?? I beat it already!
mheydar1::I do
biglump41::Mike Miller the true MVP of the heat
cbbaseball19::DAMN SKIPPY!
cbbaseball19::Side note, I hate everyone for telling me to start Tannehill over Stafford yesterday.
nba is the worst::However, it was just a reg season game.  NOTHING compared to the Lakers hiring D'Antoni and passing on Phil.  What morons!
cbbaseball19::I was happy when I heard that today.  I woke up with the breaking news going at the bottom of sports center.  I started cracking up
nba is the worst::Heat guards shot 7-34.  That's under 21%
KinickDiaz::Cause they Suck!!!
cbbaseball19::Their shooting was ABYSMAL last night
CoconutFaninFlorida::Ouch.
cbbaseball19::Spo is learning that if Mike doesnt play, they lose!
CoconutFaninFlorida::Tennessee owned us yesterday :(
nba is the worst::So, we learned yesterday that Tennessee owns Florida in multiple sports...
cbbaseball19::Tennessee is where I was born. Love that place
cbbaseball19::Shooting 38% definitely isnt going to get you a W.
nba is the worst::Did Miller play? (He's scored 3 points vs the Grizz since coming to the heat)
cbbaseball19::Nope thats why it was so bad.
IsaiahFrancis::i think it's just me, but is lebron looking a little pudgy?
TheTristanShow::Definitely just you. Lebron is one of the best athletes in the league.
KYRIEALLTHEWAY::I just dont understand how the Heat lost I find that weird
CoconutFaninFlorida::Losses happen... it's time to move on. 75 more games to go.
CoconutFaninFlorida::Just scrolled down and saw one of the saddest conversations EVER.
CoconutFaninFlorida::bwp2bruce The Heat are not winning the championship this season. That much is clearly obvious. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Huh? Based on what? A loss in game 7 of the season? Jeez, talk about prisoners of the moment..
Angel-8234::Heat suck. That's why they won't repeat.
nba is the worst::A loss in game 7...  Omen.
CoconutFaninFlorida::Oh no. I thought we traded you to MLB?
CandySparker::It's a Nice Way in Ellington.
