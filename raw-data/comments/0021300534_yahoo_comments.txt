PKM::Memphis has been decent recently.
Joseph::Suns are still floundering... can't beat the bad teams... don't have what it takes to be in the playoffs let alone win anything in the playoffs. They will be lucky to finish .500 and that won't get them in this year. Hopelessly disappointing!!!
George::I suspect this will be a tough road game for the SUNS.  Hopefully they have high energy and work as a team.  Does anyone have any idea if E Okafor will be back in time for a play-off push.
The grad::And the reigning Wester Conference  Coach of the month gets outcoached again. Why not try to win the game tonght instead of saving starters minutes for tomorrow. The bench was left in way to long while struggling in the second half. This team will be .500 before it gets to 25 victories.
brett::Both team would fall short faced with the mighty MIAMI HEAT Please watch the MIND BENDING THUMB BENDING video on Youtube for information on the conspiracy to destroy the black race. Thank you.
Cyril::Marcus Morris - 11-for-44 from the field over the last 6 games. Markieff Morris - 2-for-13 on three's over the last 10 games.   There should be a study done on these guys to see if twins can share a psychic inability to shoot.
gary::Goran got schooled by Conley. Also, the Suns need to drive to the hoop more.
Douglas H::Look at Z-bo. 7 assists. Doing his best Marc Gasol impression. Way to go Zach!
Hummingbirds 70::Hope phoenix suns wins!
Lomar::Morris brothers are good. Brotherhood stats. They are one of the reasons why SUNS kickin right now.  good pick for the suns
