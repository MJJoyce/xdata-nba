Jim::I wish the Raptors were playing Greivis tonight, I'm excited to see what he can do for our team. I hope this game is close.
Marilyn::Aron Baynes = The Big Thunder from Down Under!
Kadak_Chai::I'm no NBA expert but this Greg. Popp guy can coach !!!
John::Yep Toronto , you luck , just ran out ...you are Losers once again
RAY B::How many times have the Raptors been outscored by at least 20 points in a quarter this year? They have to be leading the league since it seems it happens very often. Is that on the coaching staff?
- LJ::amir johnson discovered his talent
C.Jin::Where has this Amir been
Osiel::go lakers
Craig::Lets get Casey and whole staffs fired after the game.....
Cyril::I think it's funny that people keep saying something's wrong with Kawhi Leonard.  Based on what?  His numbers last year were 11.9 points, 6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals on 49% shooting in 31 minutes.  His numbers this year are 11.5 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.9 steals, and 50% shooting in 27 minutes.  His production is basically the same as last year's despite his minutes dropping 4 per game. The only area of his game that has tailed off is his three-point shot.  I think people had him hyped up so much in their heads that they thought he was going to average 16 and 8 this year, and now they're disappointed that he's not living up to their expectations.
