OSUcowboys358::I don't see why they didnt put in John Lucas III down the stretch. He's easily one of the most clutch players in the NBA. Its time for a coaching change

xBudRadx::Most exciting part of this game is when Swaggy P was interviewed

YeahTerps420::The Philadelphia 2012'ers ....  anyone .... anyone?  Bueller?  Ferris ... Bueller?
Go Wolves14::.
quilwill22::we're witnessing the birth of a star in Jrue Holiday...this dude can flat out play! and he's only 22.
salemram15::Agreed, he's really beginning to evolve
Robertc-100::76ers 3 straight wins, becaause they are motivated after losing to Detroit.
Blazelover13::Doug Collins is listed on the box score for the Sixers. Ha, awesome.
Robertc-100::It's for a technical foul.
TforTempleU1::Jrue &lt;3
East coaster 4 life::Nice win Sixers. JRich is tough.
toronto-vigilante3::Another disgusting showing by the Raptors in the 4th.  I seem to be saying this every game....Think it's time I started watching the NCAA more closely....
BGSUthornton3::Raps need a head coach
dwighthowardsamazing::It's not always the 4th but they always have an awful quarter  every game I think it was against the nets when they were outscored 32-7 in the second
ElectricPhreak::that was vs sixers
toronto-vigilante3::When the fans can see the meltdown happen most nights, this team ain't learning $@%!.
East coaster 4 life::I am a Sixers fan they did that a lot last year. It's going to happen with a young team. Give them time
FTOWN215::Jrue is becoming a top tier PG . Still young too
GeorgeTownMan29::Go Holliday! all star for sure. Maybe if Bynum stops being a goofy f### the sixers can make a run for the top seed
jasondmce1978::haha Doug Collins registered a DNP in the box score
dwighthowardsamazing::Bc a technical
BXwarriorBX::lin 25mil fields 20 mil ? bwaahhwbhwahwha
KThonk::anyone outside of Philly notice Holiday is becoming a star??
dwighthowardsamazing::Right all star probably not hof can't lead a team to the championship but is a nice 2 option on a team with a franchise player when Bynum can get healthy
KThonk::at 22 his potential in unlimited. He can shoot, get to the hoop and create for others. and best of all is he plays big in big games. look at his playoff stats the last 2 years
just2940::Like I said, he will be a well deserving all star
just2940::Nah, don't think Jure will be in the Oscar Robinson, Magic Johnson, John Stockton, Gary Payton, Dereck Rose, etc. category. I see him more as just an all star. I guess I shouldn't say just.
Sportsman45029::he'll be as good as derrick rose
just2940::agreed, well said
CoreyGallagherArt::Obviously not going to lead a team to a Championship, very few players can, but he's keeping this Sixers squad afloat and that's all I can ask for of a 16th pick.
just2940::Allstar, not superstar
CoreyGallagherArt::baby steps
just2940::I'm also out. Slick, you may be the only one left lol. Talk to all you guys the next time the Raps and 6ers play.
slickwatts100::based on the pre season i thought wayns would play more
FlyGuys623::aight im tired. peace
slickwatts100::peace
just2940::pce brotha
just2940::Raps should try to move Bargnani's contract. Who's with me?? Bargnani/Calderon Package might be attractive to few teams
joemsz13::I think Calderon is good for the Lakers so that  2 Spanish players will play
just2940::Not really. Bargnani's contract is moveable (just under 10) and this is Caldron's last year on his contract.
just2940::He could be a good option off the bench though
just2940::I know what Bargnani is. He's hit his ceiling and frankly I don;t like it. He can score (on occasion), but his D, rebounding  and basketball IQ is horrendous.
FlyGuys623::oh ok
FlyGuys623::would it be a big salary dump?
FlyGuys623::he missed a some yesterday which brought it down, but here are his stats http://espn.go.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/2386/andre-iguodala
shahidi125::51 points scored in each quarter. Weird.
slickwatts100::so iggy $@%!$@% about coach collins not letting him shoot 3's here, how's that working out for him in denver?
slickwatts100::is he shooting more of them?
FlyGuys623::yeh
FlyGuys623::he actually is doing pretty well three point shooting wise the last time i checked but his ppg really isnt improving much
Mumu8833::32.5% is a little under "well"
JIMMY_RUSTLE::rapters=choke
just2940::Yep
TorontoSportsDynasty::Same crap, Raptors just suck in the 4th.
just2940::Yea, this one burned. We'll get there one day lol For now...GO JAYS!
FlyGuys623::your coach is somewhat responsible for it
FlyGuys623::your guys need to realize that your bigs were doing work against ours in the post. happened both games
just2940::Also, we just don't have anyone who can finish. No one is clutch.
FlyGuys623::wow, butler is choking
EL_ABALLARDE::It will be wise remove Shannon Brown and add Patrick Patterson, Shane Battier, Kyle Singler, Kawhi Leonard or VInce Carter in my team in fantasy games? Suggestions, ty!!!
EL_ABALLARDE::leonard and singler are available in my fantasy league but kawhi is hurt so...
FlyGuys623::i got nothing for ya. sorry
katx5h::patterson no. battier no. singler maybe. leonard maybe. carter no
FlyGuys623::it will be exciting to see how jrue does if and when bynum plays. he will finally have a center he can pass to
slickwatts100::knees and feet. when a big has problems in those areas it's like a racehorse with a broken leg
slickwatts100::imagine him healthy though
FlyGuys623::mhmm. unfortunate consequence of being that big
slickwatts100::i'm throwing the towel in on that dude. its starting to look like a greg oden situation seriously
just2940::I hope not. I'm not a Philly fan (I'm a Raps fan), but you would hate to see someone with that much talent fall. He could be dominant in the East. Who else has a centre like him in the East. I'll tell you who, no one lol
FlyGuys623::i understand
just2940::That's a legit point
katx5h::Guards averaging an 18 and 8 at age 22 or younger: Chris Paul, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Kevin Johnson, Russell Westbrook, Isiah Thomas, Baron Davis, Stephon Marbury, Damon Stoudamire  Jrue Holliday has a bright future.
katx5h::If you lower it to 16 and 7, you can add Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Jason Kidd, Allen Iverson, John Wall to that list.  I think Jrue gonna's be that dude.
just2940::I think Jure will be an all star player.
just2940::It's early. Look at Lowry's averages before he got hurt. Something like 23pts 8ast 7rebs
Hizfer123::Well Toronto at least you aren't the Wizards
just2940::At least we have the Blue Jays :D
loomus7::Don't you mean the Marlins?   As a Phillies fan, thanks!
FlyGuys623::when rose is healthy i'll say jrue is probably the 3rd or 4th best pg in the east. he can get even better too. (just my opinion tho)
slickwatts100::yet people still rank wilt higher than russell
slickwatts100::that's another one. rg3 is a beast but we'll see who wins more
just2940::It's true, when it's all said and done. Ships and wins will be the decider when the difference in ability that marginal.
slickwatts100::they're gonna have great battles for years
just2940::RG3 and Luck kind of battles?? lol :)
slickwatts100::he was better than kyrie the other night
just2940::I think Kyrie has a higher ceiling. Just my opinion though
FlyGuys623::didnt he play great d against kyrie (yep, only 9 points)
IggyIsClutch::If rosé keeps getting injured If d will keeps declining  If rondo doesn't improve his offense Irving stays injury prone Then jrue can definitely be the best pg in the east but these things probably won't happen
IggyIsClutch::Most people would agree with you (me too) however we don't know how good jrue can be yet
just2940::@Iggy. That may be true. If I had to choose, I;d take Kyrie. And I'm sure that wouldn't be a ridiculous decision
IggyIsClutch::They say that because Kyrie has the potential to be the next cp3, but jrue is only 22 and he has loads of potential as well.
just2940::Ahh man, don't think I can agree. I think Jure can be an All-Star, Kyrie I think is going to be a superstar - Derek Rose status
FlyGuys623::i think analysts will always put kyrie over jrue, but i think jrue is better all around
xvolcom19x::Rondo and DWill have somethin to say about that
bballdon32::He's def gonna get better, he's only 22.
slickwatts100::yeah he's a puppy, the thing you like is he's getting better. the turnovers are high but he only averaged 5 assists last year
FlyGuys623::yep its hard to imagine that sometimes, but he came into the league so young
slickwatts100::would you take wall over him?
FlyGuys623::hell f.ucking no
just2940::I wouldn't personally
slickwatts100::3rd or 4th won't get him to the all star game but i'd like to see him go
FlyGuys623::well rose is out for a while so yah never know
The_Grand_Poobah3::I like that 61 yr old Doug Collins is in the box score lol
bballdon32::hahah thts great
FlyGuys623::dude is raw
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Peace out
FlyGuys623::peace. you'll know who to pick tomorrow
garland77327::Wish Hawes would grow a set inside
7horns7eyes::He already has a pair of ovaries, though...
slickwatts100::name the eastern conference pgs better than jrue
slickwatts100::maybe just2940, i don't get to see toronto often
just2940::That's fair. I like FlyGuy's comment. It's about personal pref
slickwatts100::no jennings right?
FlyGuys623::hes pretty damn good too
just2940::Everyone is going to disagree, but Lowry is one of them, even Calderon is not far off
just2940::Slick, don't overlook Lowry. He's legit. Among the top 2 or 3 defenders at the PG position in the East. Put that with his reb, pass, scoring ability and you have a more than serviceable guard. He's legit man.
just2940::Yea def debatable. Jure could have a higher ceiling though
slickwatts100::i'm definitely gonna disagree
FlyGuys623::i was thinking him and jrue are pretty close. debatable
garland77327::D Will...don't know, rondo...at times, Rose...yes
slickwatts100::rondo d will healthy rose then who?
IggyIsClutch::Irving maybe
FlyGuys623::you could say d will. irving maybe.
garland77327::Here they are  - -
FlyGuys623::mostly all of its debatable. there are a bunch that he is close with. based on personal preference
slickwatts100::we're pretty lucky orlando included j rich as a throw in
garland77327::Allen is a HOF'er but Rich has nearly as many 3's
slickwatts100::he did a 360 throwdown on a breakaway this year so he still got some life in his legs
slickwatts100::he's only 32 that's no dinosaur
xvolcom19x::True, but he's the next step down from him and we can't expect to get good solid vets who will compete year in year out. JRich will, he's a baller.
just2940::Hmm, Allen is a HOFer. Can't say JRich can mimic Allen's twilight  years
xvolcom19x::Look at Ray Ray, JRich can definitely keep it goin for that long.. Would love to see them keep him for the rest of his career.
just2940::For a swing man, it kinda is. He did play well tn though
garland77327::Nope, not with his game
FlyGuys623::doesnt just help us with scoring but he helps us with the veteran presence which this team needed badly with iggy and elton gone
xvolcom19x::I don't think the trade would of went down if we didn't get JRich
keezy105::hell yea we had cap room i was never mad about getting jrich a la mode. turns out so far hes been the most valuable part of the trade eevn tho i believe in bynum
garland77327::Love J Rich, he can get you 20 any night which really helps our offense, seems to be a team leader as well
bballdon32::yea he's a stud
IggyIsClutch::GG rap fans and cya sixers fans tommorrow when we take on the Irving less cavs.
FlyGuys623::peace, hopefully 8-4 tomorrow
IggyIsClutch::Yeah Gnight  man
kkawesome50::If you look at the box score doug collins is in it haha. If you click on his name his playercard says hes 61 lol.
lucas1681::YOLO!!!
lucas1681::ok, im sorry
lucas1681::jk, YOLO
7horns7eyes::Thank god; if you were to die, we wouldn't have to deal with you anymore.
lucas1681::i don't care because YOLO
7horns7eyes::This isn't Facebook.
FlyGuys623::you are messing with my mind grandmas boy. tell me the truth
GrandmasBoyDawg858::I'm lying sorry im a chump
FlyGuys623::thats ok. i forgive you
GrandmasBoyDawg858::6ers buddy u know I like swaggy p
FlyGuys623::aight. good
Sh4k4zulu::aightz night guys - good game and haters gonna hate but we walk away with W
FlyGuys623::peace man
gocaliforniabears::Bynum is a huge joke. I'm going to the Lakers vs. 76ers game on New Year's Day...if he's back then (which he probably won't be), Howard will drop 50.
FlyGuys623::go to your lakers board. maybe someone there will care
garland77327::Yeah..just like he's done all year....LMFAO
slickwatts100::i thought we needed to get our heads checked when we signed kwame brown but i never realized how good of a low post defender he is
keezy105::hes so bad on offense tho and all he is on d is low post defense he doesnt deserve 5 mill
garland77327::That's why we paid him 3
just2940::Still a bust, though
slickwatts100::forget the draft status he'll never live up to that
just2940::Are you Philly fans okay with Mike Vick as the QB? Just curious to see what the consensus is.
just2940::I'd give Vick one more season with a new playbook. Honestly I don't think Any has handled him well.
xvolcom19x::He's gone, failed experiment. Not all his fault, but he didn't do hot himself.
just2940::He got so much potential still I think, you see glimpses. I think he needs to be less of a gun slinger and throw more screens and quick hits over the middle. His legs are still a threat.
Philliesallday::mehh.  This season is honestly not his fault. This Oline has to be the worse in the league.  I want Foles to play the rest of the season, if he plays well maybe move on to him, if not go back to vick
keezy105::i was cool with the whole prison dogkilling thing until he started sucking major balls now hes juts a convict dogkiller that sucks balls and cant play qb
FlyGuys623::i dont hate him but we'll never win a superbowl with him
keezy105::no
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Thinking the lakers will cover -7 flyguy what u think?
GrandmasBoyDawg858::I was just kidding u know i really took 6ers -5.5
Philliesallday::Nets are terrible inside (on D) Howard and Pau should a great games
GrandmasBoyDawg858::So your telling to take +7 nets
FlyGuys623::im not saying anything. coming to the wrong guy for betting help
FlyGuys623::i cant make any predictions with the lakers
IggyIsClutch::Holiday for the all star game!
FlyGuys623::he should but its too much of a popularity contest. i'll bet fatton will get more votes than jrue
FlyGuys623::oh ok. thats cool
IggyIsClutch::Coaches vote for bench players That's how Iggy got on the team last year
Hard Work Over Talent::For every point Calderon scores, the other team scores 2 more.
slickwatts100::if you lower your expectations of turner and don't hold his draft position against him he's actually a solid player
keezy105::hes got a lot of development but if u watched the sophmores vs rookies game he was pretty sick in a good pool of talent
swami723::Oggy was good
garland77327::Turner is fine, Iggy without the crazy dunks
slickwatts100::omg if he had iggys athleticism
swami723::Did we trad our first round draft pick
slickwatts100::in the bynum deal yep and i believe we let another one go for moultrie
