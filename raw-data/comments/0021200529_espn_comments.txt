mkwan0::So, the elephant in the room is the very real possibility that after winning their ring, the Heat just don't have the hunger.  Everyone keeps saying that they wouldn't lose these games if they cared...but champions always care.
jabbadonut::I picked up Batum and Mathews as free agents in my fantasy league a few weeks into the season. They've been solid for me, and have helped my team recover from a 2-22 start to move into 2nd place in my division after last week. Thank you, fantasy owners who jettisoned these guys. I bet you're wishing you hadn't done that about now!

Permanot::Allons enfants de la Patrie Le jour de gloire est arrivé ! Contre nous de la tyrannie L'étendard sanglant est levé Entendez-vous dans nos campagnes Mugir ces féroces soldats? Ils viennent jusque dans vos bras. Égorger vos fils, vos compagnes!  Aux armes citoyens Formez vos bataillons Marchons, marchons Qu'un sang impur Abreuve nos sillons  Que veut cette horde d'esclaves De traîtres, de rois conjurés? Pour qui ces ignobles entraves Ces fers dès longtemps préparés? Français, pour nous, ah! quel outrage Quels transports il doit exciter? C'est nous qu'on ose méditer De rendre à l'antique esclavage!  Quoi ces cohortes étrangères! Feraient la loi dans nos foyers! Quoi! ces phalanges mercenaires Terrasseraient nos fils guerriers! Grand Dieu! par des mains enchaînées Nos fronts sous le joug se ploieraient De vils despotes deviendraient Les maîtres des destinées.  Tremblez, tyrans et vous perfides L'opprobre de tous les partis Tremblez! vos projets parricides Vont enfin recevoir leurs prix! Tout est soldat pour vous combattre S'ils tombent, nos jeunes héros La France en produit de nouveaux, Contre vous tout prêts à se battre.  Français, en guerriers magnanimes Portez ou retenez vos coups! Épargnez ces tristes victimes À regret s'armant contre nous Mais ces despotes sanguinaires Mais ces complices de Bouillé Tous ces tigres qui, sans pitié Déchirent le sein de leur mère!  Nous entrerons dans la carrière Quand nos aînés n'y seront plus Nous y trouverons leur poussière Et la trace de leurs vertus Bien moins jaloux de leur survivre Que de partager leur cercueil Nous aurons le sublime orgueil De les venger ou de les suivre!  Amour sacré de la Patrie Conduis, soutiens nos bras vengeurs Liberté, Liberté chérie Combats avec tes défenseurs! Sous nos drapeaux, que la victoire Accoure à tes mâles accents Que tes ennemis expirants Voient ton triomphe et notre gloire!
