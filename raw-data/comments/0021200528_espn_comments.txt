trachea01::Espn drama much? You have a video on your page that says cousins brutally punched carter and here you say he elbowed him. Why couldn't you just say the truth which was he pushed his face?
Tim Lincecum Fan Club::DMC is the best young bigman in the game talent wise no question.
scottpilgrim33::I'm so happy the Mavericks finally won for a change. hope this starts a huge winning streak
mosesbyu::Free Jimmer.
dodgertodd88::Can't believe the Kings lost control of this one. Wait...is that Keith Smart on the sideline? Is he their coach?  Never mind. I can believe it.
Tebowing All Day Everyday 1979::I started following this betting system called SportsBettingStar for 2 months now.  I was able to find out about this website on the first page of Google by looking up Sports Betting Systems.  Since I joined, I've made around $3K per month just by using it.  Ive tried multiple systems in the past, but nothing compares to how well this system works.
XmanY::WOW, Cousins may have his problems but that clearly wasnt a flagrant foul. Loose ball foul at best and likely should have been a loose ball foul against the Mavs when they were all over him.
LAKER HATTER::Your right, horrible call
Delontes Alter Ego.::WTF were you watching? He threw his elbow at Vince, he deserves a suspension.
Ryan51724::Well at least Cousins is getting better. See this time, right after he elbowed Carter in the throat, he realized it was stupid and tried to apologize. Soon he might be able to think about what he's GOING to do, realize they're stupid, and not do them. Last night was a sign of progress.
tmd39::That was a flagrant 2? He caught him and kept him from falling. That's a joke. All about rep.
gosports53::it's just like Suh's foot stomp last year.  Cousin's tried to act as if it was accidental and immediately reach to help, but the dude knew what he was doing.
dodgertodd88::It was a Flagrant 2 that was made to look less bad because he tried to catch him. If he wasn't Boogie, that may have knocked it down to F1.
2noodlekaboodle::As much as I dislike DMC I can't disagree. That was more about Cousins reputation than the actual foul.
TheFeedMachine::The Mavs won a game in OT? What did their OT losing streak end at? 10?
ALLforthelulz::"I swear to God I didn't try to do that. I'm just tired of being in these situations," Cousins said  what situations? where you throw elbows? its all YOU ya $@%!$@%. he just doesn't get it
drewokc::As a life-long Mavs fan, surviving an OT game against Sacramento is what I've always wanted. Great job front office!
futile27::Anyone else like what they saw from Mike James, seriously few more games this dude will be playing every 4th quarter
CancunSaints::I had the brew, she had the chronic, the Mavericks beat the Supersonics.
AdamMcDermott88::The Mavs have fallen very far. Cuban couldn't land a big name and the team he threw together is pretty ugly.
Idrum88::they actually have tons of talent....just gotta get it together
ALLforthelulz::come may, this same roster will be scary. you're just a fair weather basketball fan
Daryl_Dixon::Mavs need someone who can handle the ball at the end of these games.
562-bell gardens::i'm  tired of  carrying  my team -d.cousins
5891jonathan::Nice try, Sonics.
thegooddoc456::lol...I guess its not too early to start getting used to it.
basket_guru::ok, Mavs won, but i can't understand, how Carlisle is so stupid at the end of regulation? when you got +3 and left just about 10 seconds, every european coach commanded to foul and prevent the opponent to throw the three-pointer. damn, it's almost cost the win. thanks to old man VC, who was the best player at the end of the game.
Daryl_Dixon::After watching this whole game, I now know why the Mavs are 14-23
---LeTs gO mAvS---::they can't finish games. They should rename us the Dallas Lebronz. We suck in the 4th quarter. You would never say that about previous Mavs teams cause Terry and Dirk would always close out the 4th
Daryl_Dixon::Mavs need a PG. Collison was an utter embarrassment tonight.
---LeTs gO mAvS---::Mavs need a pass first pg. I still like Collison and he's been better ever since Dirk gotten back
yaczapped::two words Vince Carter
JBurhenn253::Now that the king are moving, the sonics need to trade jimmer so I don't have to hear his groupies $@%!$ and moan all day long.
ret12364::Oh how the times have changed. 10 years ago, Kings vs Mavs was like the best basketball show on earth. Now its almost like a midget fight.
Delontes Alter Ego.::Who wouldn't want to see a midget fight?
ThinYellowLine::Cuz gonna get fined again ha haw
Greg Oden PayDay Loan Spokesmen::Twitter gangsters
Christopher Emmanuel Paul:::):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)
calvintheidiot::I'm a brick chucker. Are you a brick chucker?
Baby Kobe 8-24::America WINS
theville3205::Yessir, they do.
dirkaqs41::John Calipari: friend to the nations best stupid athletes....er..... student athletes
Awesome Craiggers::Haha, you lose and your team's moving away.  Sucks to be you!!!
NBASmallMarketTeamsNeverWin::Kings suck hot poop filled bootyhole. I don't think any one in Sac who pays taxes is exactly crying right now, knowing that a corporation or business can move into the railyard where they were going to build an arena for the loserly Queens.
Tim Lincecum Fan Club::I would think that you're a $@%!$@. You like your own posts because no one else will.
Awesome Craiggers::I would think that they're all crying.  They live in Sacramento.
razzledazzletj81::It's like 5 on 4 when Jimmer plays due to his lack of touches
schuylervillesux::30 minutes over the last 6 games, I would like to see how you would shoot in that situation, everyone on you and getting constantly kicked in the nuts by your head coach.....bs
PhatmanXL::He's shot 20% over the past six games
AquaTeenHungerForce::lack of talent
kevish24::Lack of talent? He is scoring 8 points a game in only 14 min on the court.  He is shooting over 40% from the 3 point line and over 90% from the free throw line.  If they are not going to play Jimmer they should trade him.  Coach is a moron.
Jim7419::No not black enough!
H-Town Dream Shake::Rockets&gt;&gt;&gt;Mavs
theville3205::duh
NBASmallMarketTeamsNeverWin::Finally Sacramento won't be attached to the hot garbage known as the Queens. Good riddance! We still have the Rivercats.
rtoledo66::I'm a Cousins fanboy - Metta World Peace
theville3205::Ray Allen's a traitor.
theville3205::Wesley Mattheewwwwssss
outkastD::who cares. move on already.
theville3205::As long as you know. Go Blazers.
MSkiLLz32::Lol wow Mavs tried their best to lose this game in OT again.
vanpelt4prez::Keith Smart would play Larry Bird 15 minutes  a game in his prime cause he's white
dirkaqs41::Mavs 1st won OT tipoff of the season=1st OT win...thanks cousins.
RealReporter63::Didnt the kings have a big lead tonight?
Idrum88::17
colaroaster::chins up kings fans you'll get them next time
lionstigerssparty6::Cousins is a dumb@ss
NBASmallMarketTeamsNeverWin::The Kings roster is full of dumb@sses
lionstigerssparty6::but he takes the cake
Noah Trojan::Send the Kings to Fresno, Stockton, Modesto or Bakersfield so those pri.cks can learn to appreciate what they have here.
ChargersFan4Life001::im out, GG Mavs fans
---LeTs gO mAvS---::I actually wanted my mavs to lose. Oh we'll we still have a top 10 lottery pick
Justinkm83::Mavs will have the most cap space this off-season. Enjoy saying we suck now because it won't last.
Muscatatuck767::No idea on Harden's contract, but Lin and Asik are 5 mil each this year, next year, then both jump to 15 mil in the 3rd year I think...not sure on Harden's contract
Tim Lincecum Fan Club::No lin's contract is even every year, it was offered with a massive 3rd year, but that only applies to the team willing to match, not the Rockets who can spread that 10m out over the 3 years.
fullmetalx117::How? They just signed Lin and harden
H-Town Dream Shake::All their players besides Lin, Harden, and Asik are still in their rookie contracts. Rockets have the lowest payroll of any team at 46 million.
H-Town Dream Shake::Actually the rockets will have the most cap space next year.
H-Town Dream Shake::Mayo will be offered max after this season and Dirk will be talked into an extension. There goes a few million there.
Justinkm83::I don't think so. You have to take into account how many expiring contracts we have.
dirkaqs41::Mike james for mvp
fullmetalx117::The Dallas Mavericks are BAD but even they have the pride to be not as bad as the Kings.
H-Town Dream Shake::They almost have the same record they're both evenly matched.
itsatrap123::Noooooo....good game Mavs fans.
rtoledo66::Like if you think the Maloofs S.U.C.K.
