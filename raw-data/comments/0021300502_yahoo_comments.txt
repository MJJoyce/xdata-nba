Michael::Lee is traded for another nobody to fill his seat on the bench.  Now get Green and Wallace out of here and the rebuilding of a winner will ensue.
Gary::Sounds like sour grapes Garrett. The fact is NBA officials seem to be very inconsistent regardless of the venue.
.8734::This makes Sullinger 6-28 the last two games. Where's the Bozo who said he should be on the all star team.
Garrett::Now I understand why a lot of people don't like it when their team plays at OKC. Whenever their team goes on a little run and have an advantage, refs will call the most little ticky-tack foul in favor of the Thunder which ends up being points on the board for them.
Dan::wow. perkins score more than 2 points. you know your team is bad when he scores in double digit.
PKM::Jef Green needs to show up.
Udaman8295::courtney lee for bayless. i like the trade if it happens, should clear up the back court for bradley and crawford for when rondo comes back. when he does come back we got,  bradley the starting SG and crawford to back him up. and rondo at PG with a solid PG in bayless to back rondo up. the team might be really good if rondo shows up and looks nice.
Guest::KD gonna be a wee bit tired tonight. Hope his mates can step it up a bit for him.
The Most Interesting Man in the World::The beat downs continue.  If you would've told me the C's would hit 11/23 threes and have 23 team assists, I would have said 'It's about time.  How many did we win by?'  And then you would say 'ummm you lost by 23.'
Mack::It's great playing against the Celtics...you can give your starters a lot of rest.
