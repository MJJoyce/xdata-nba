TD::The Cats are much improved (finally they somewhat look like an NBA team), to say the least, however, it may be time to start thinking about packaging or putting together a deal to move MKG (a package for maybe a lottery pick in this 2014 class). I like the kid, he is a heck of a defender, however, that shot is a mess.....and the team really could use a legitimate scorer at the position.
hl444::What kind of lineup is that in for the Bobcats now?  Their bench is very weak and usually gives the game away.
TayC::toronto gives up more fouls than any other team in the league, besides the knicks, which is why they are losing this game, among other reasons like everyone being off.  down by just about 20 and they have given up 18-23 from the line
cjk::I dont  understand why Zellers not getting more minutes than he does, he's obviously just as good,if not better than Mcbob. (no disrespect) And he puts up pretty good numbers for the short time he's in there.This coach is clueless .
The Watcher::Nice "bounceback" Raps. Geez, you can't win them all but going down by 30? Come on then the typical comeback only to lose. Come on now. This current streak was supposed to distance you from the field...
Jim::where is DJ Augustine playing at? He would be a good resign to bring back? Could help at point?
Steve Moore::Every team needs 3pt shooting, and all Novak does is drain them all day.
Anton::How do you go down by 30 against the Bobcats in the first place? lol
Mister E::Give the ball to Jonas in the post.
seth::Drop Ben Gordon and sign Jax back.
