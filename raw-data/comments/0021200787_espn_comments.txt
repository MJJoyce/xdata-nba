deldbrown::After shooting for 60% in 6 straight games, Lebron James is now in a slump.  Although he's averaging 31-9-9 in the last 2 games, he's only shooting at 56%.
nba is the worst::As I've said for awhile now, the Heat simply own OKC and their clueless coach.  This one was over after the 1st 6 minutes, hopefully we will be spared this matchup in the Finals this year, so boring!
dolphinsLETSgo::durant &gt; lebron  all day
Mambaholic 33::At what? Shooting f/t's... Get's anymore one sided - they're going to have to throw in the challenge flag on KFTD...Refs can't do anymore for him  ---KEVIN FREE-THROW DURANT  btw: Losing 90% to Lebron and being behind him in almost every statistical category - some by allot...doesn't qualify as being better??
deldbrown::FT is all the matter. You shouldn't pay attention to shooting %, assist rate, rebound rate, or stats in the clutch.
smokingstogies305::I just heard the Christmas carol  "I' m dreaming of a white Chris Bosh."  It's Great!
A Cane Thang::790 is the shiz
pdiddy0622::I saw a post by an OKC fan stating Kevin owned Bron cuz he scored more points in this game. SMH
cofcrules09::Lebron owns Kevin Durant now.
Rad_Shadow::He's owned him for awhile now.   Just people need to stop buying into ESPN hype machines. That's how Rose won the MVP over LeBron.
Intellibeam15::Yep...very true Now rose is too affraid he'll never be considered that great again
columbozim::Someone should let lil' Kev Durant know that getting technicals doesn't make you look hard, it makes you look thoughtless and without discipline.
Lawrence246::Ive been following a system for betting lately called SportsBettingStar.  In just 60 days time, Ive averaged 3K per month in profits.  I found this system on the first page of Google by looking up Sports Betting Systems.
columbozim::Wow I'm totally going to go there and bet thousands of dollars now, thank you!!!!
A Cane Thang::It has too be ripoff songs like this Intelliebeam https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmR9fIfzMPI
Intellibeam15::Got you....
BexyIndy55::Hopefully the Spurs or the Clips get by the Thunder this year so we don't have to watch another choke/retreat back to your shell performance from last year.  OKC doesn't have the coaching or team psyche to beat the Heat.
Intellibeam15::You right about that
A Cane Thang::Does anyone want to write Heat love songs with me? We can hear them on 790 the ticket.
A Cane Thang::I'm at "yo, yo..yo"
Intellibeam15::How bout....the heat are on a roll After that
A Cane Thang::Aight cool dogg
Intellibeam15::What you got so far....

Intellibeam15::Is that you Flo-Rida ???
84 was a good draft::Limp Bizkit dude
Intellibeam15::Thunder is nothing without lightning.......Just a bunch of noise I think we witnessed that last night
lil_Stratboy::Durant should sue Airline companies! (not hairline)
kitastrophy34::i dun get it...

We both know the Heat wasnt trying::First Westbrook takes Durant's food , next he takes Durant's shots
lil_Stratboy::Durant's girl too?

Intellibeam15::My cousin coached Westbrook in high school And he didn't pass back then either..... And I'm not gonna help him with his game till the Heat win at least 7 championships!
We both know the Heat wasnt trying::Miami&gt; OKC &gt; SA&gt; Miami  ahahahhahahahahaha

cbbaseball19::Why would I have a black eye?
koke003::Amazon 4 Lyfe!!
duro.::greatest company on earf i buy 95% of my stuff there
A Cane Thang::Did you guys see this one about the Owl in the pickup truck's grill? http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-02-13/news/fl-plantation-owl-road-trip-20130213_1_owl-lucky-bird-ford-suv
Aicyla22::weird
duro.::silly owl, you're not a grill
cbbaseball19::That ish is crazy!
lil_Stratboy::*cray cray
C2Poke88::The Spurs are the only team in the NBA that has a legit chance to challenge Miami.  They have what a team would need against Miami in a 7-gm series.  An all-star PG, a great big man who can score in the paint, a 3rd scoring option in Genobli, 3-pt shooting, and a quality bench.  In the end though, I think Miami would win the series due to the age and fragility of Duncan and Ginobli.  Plus they have no answers defensively for Lebron, Wade, Bosh and Miami's 3-pt shooters.
kitastrophy34::They won't be able to win a 7 game series against the Thunder, Clippers, or the Nuggets.
kitastrophy34::They won't get there so it doesn't matter
C2Poke88::Without Harden, I think they get past OKC.  The Clippers are a poor FT shooting team.  If the Spurs end up with the #1 seed in the West, they won't have to play both OKC and the Clippers.  Those 2 teams will have to play each other.  I think San Antonio will take care of which ever team advances to face them in the WCF.
Aicyla22::if they do they will be tired from playing all those young fast teams
lil_Stratboy::Aicyla do you do scissors? or you are like the others.
Aicyla22::?
lil_Stratboy::Anytime ^_^
Aicyla22::hahaha
lil_Stratboy::they call me Aquaman, I can make rivers come out of scissors
Aicyla22::perhaps
lil_Stratboy::May I be the paper between those scissors?
Aicyla22::oh gotcha, only on the weekends
habs fans cant stop me::oh lord
lil_Stratboy::don't you know ESPN bans some words? don't you understand what I'am trying to say? :)
duro.::think about the ends of the scissors as being legs
duro.::that's lesbian sex
We both know the Heat wasnt trying::Durant and 'Melo = 40 points , no impact
kitastrophy34::you're stupid dude, no impact but 2nd in the west and 2nd favorite to win the league... get a brain cell or two
C2Poke88::Duran't 40 pts was no impact.  He only had 18 pts thru 3 quarters.  He didn't do much of anything while his team was getting blown out.  He heated up in the 4th with the help of all those FTs the refs gifted him with, but the outcome was already certain by that time.  It didn't benefit KD's team at all.  His 40 pts only looks good on the stat sheet.  THAT is the epitome of "no impact".
Aint Bout Dis Life Vol. III::outty 5000!
koke003::Pce brotha!
Aicyla22::byeee
habs fans cant stop me::peace man
cbbaseball19::Audi?
duro.::peace out playaaaa!
habs fans cant stop me::spurs are a good team this year if pop wins another title then he is going to be one of the best coaches in the nba
A Cane Thang::Reggie Johnson &gt; Dwight Howard
cbbaseball19::Shane Larkin &gt; Russell Westbrook
kitastrophy34::read a book sometime, it may give you some knowledge that you are clearly lacking
cbbaseball19::Thats correct.  Respect it!
kitastrophy34::obviously, anyone that pays for insider information is a Nobel prize winner!
cbbaseball19::Im a genius buddy.  Get a clue
kitastrophy34::Westbrook is so bad that he is 7th on the scoring list with the #1 scorer in the league on the same team...
cbbaseball19::Plus all those gifted free throws
cbbaseball19::they jack up way too many shots.
Intellibeam15::OK State &gt; OKC
duro.::Barry Larkin &gt; Westbrick
cbbaseball19::Of course his dad would be better if he is better!
A Cane Thang::Kenny Kadji &gt; Kevin Durant (dead $@% serious)
koke003::Durant is a fraud
kitastrophy34::your mother should have aborted you
duro.::i think the finals matchup will be  Heat  vs Doesn't really matter
Aicyla22::but to make it fair spo should just start the bench
Aicyla22::you so smart
duro.::not only that, i'm a gentleman as well
cbbaseball19::Hurricanes &gt; OKC
habs fans cant stop me::i can see a clipers heat finals
We both know the Heat wasnt trying::MIAMI IN 3. Game 4 canceled
Intellibeam15::The closest we'll get to that is the All Star game....
lil_Stratboy::no, no clips for you
We both know the Heat wasnt trying::We just need OKC to take care of San Antonio for us , then we'll sweep the sh-tty Thunder
AmazinGrapeOKC::you scared of the Spurs??
kitastrophy34::we will run the spurs off the court in 5 or 6
lil_Stratboy::they are a dangerously strong team, and POP knows how to stop each of the Heat big 3. No wonder he's the 5th best coach in the history of the league
We both know the Heat wasnt trying::well , theres no one else out west to be scared of
koke003::Spurs are way better than the Thunder but no
Intellibeam15::I live in Los Angeles and it hasn't rained yet all this year......
AmazinGrapeOKC::Fk Miami
Intellibeam15::OK State &gt; OKC
duro.::it's FL* Miami
cbbaseball19::Thats rude
Aicyla22::aw sorry
A Cane Thang::http://www.sun-sentinel.com/health/fl-pill-mill-crackdown-heroin-20130215,0,1318861.story
Aicyla22::no bueno
habs fans cant stop me::are the clipers a fav in the west to win it all
lil_Stratboy::uh no, they still can't beat San Antonio, OKC, Golden State
habs fans cant stop me::true but when it comes to playoff time i can see the clipers going fair
