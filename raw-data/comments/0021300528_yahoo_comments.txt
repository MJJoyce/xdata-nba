clint::if the game had gone another 15 minutes Crawford could have taken 10 more shots.
Stanton::These are the games the Clippers have to win while Paul is out. Handled Orlando, get this one, get the Lakers next...don't mess around with these lower level teams, need the wins.
Clipperdude::Clippers need to keep up their defensive pressure. Hopefully Jamal gets his shot falling too, Let's go Clippers!
Steve Moore::Rivers sure has gotten a lot of mileage for taking credit for Tom Thibideaus title in Boston.
Cyril::Sullinger just needs to sit out until his hand has healed and he can shoot again.  He seems to be getting frustrated and has three flagrant fouls in the last two games.
Michael::The C's coach is running out of clichés.  The only positive thing these clowns got out of this game was their paycheck.
brian::Celtics are toast if they can't close out on the perimeter. If they cannot run guys like Crawford off of his preferred outside spots, forget about it. If they hold the Clips under 30% from behind the line. Maybe a close game if they turn the tempo up in the transition game. Perhaps utilizing Bayliss in that role.
John::The Slug can't guard nobody. Blake is taking him to school.
Michael ZZ::Ben the Bozo another POS Tool that brings Politics into everything. Guess you wouldn't get noticed otherwise Moron.
.8734::WOW!! what a beast Sullinger is. Four fouls and two points not to mention shooting 16%. Where's the clown who said he should be an all star.
