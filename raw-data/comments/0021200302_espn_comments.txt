mosesbyu::Free Jimmer.
Kels09::OJ Mayo said DeMarcus Cousins has "mental issues"  http://roundballdaily.com/2012/12/11/oj-mayo-says-demarcus-cousins-has-mental-issues/
ToledoMan::Kaman, Fish, and Mayo are paying dividends.  Add in a healthy Dirk, and this team should do some things.
sandiegonation::Rick Carlile is awesome!
fanofstevenash::Cuban has made a lot of good moves.  He's made a few bad ones too, but Mayo is a bargain.    Cuban was smart enough to realize just because Mayo wasn't fitting in right in Memphis, it didn't mean he couldn't get it done.    At 4 million per year and Mayo playing with something to prove... that is money well spent.  Cuban also hedged his bet well by only committing to 2 years.    Furthermore, why not pick up Elton Brand for peanuts.  He was basically free so there is nothing to lose if he doesn't return to form.
ChrisBoshMightBeAShemale::Tyreke Evans - DNP CD?
antonioy2j::Oj Mayo has carried the team much more as of late. Will only get better once Dirk returns and main focus is on Dirk rather than Mayo. Mayo will definitely be putting up all-star numbers this season.
ChrisBoshMightBeAShemale::def an All Star worthy season so far. 20 points and FG% is off the charts for a shooting guard
antonioy2j::Already have as MFFL I'm hoping Mayo gets in so our Mavs can be represented by someone in this years all-star game since Dirk may or may not get in due to lack of playing time. Also hope Crowder plays more like he did in the beggining of the season. I could see him making an all-rookie team.
---LeTs gO mAvS---::He deserves an all star spot. Vote for him! Mavs also need to lock him up before he becomes a free agent
outdoorathletic801::FREE JIMMER
TheRydog3::lots of teams would. LAL, OKC, BOS, anyone but SAC
larsondjs76::Jimmer only goes in when the other team doesn't have a quick point guard
ChrisBoshMightBeAShemale::what team would give him more playing time?
gregorywalts1966::Ive been using a bet system named Sportsbettingstar. In my first month I doubled my starting balance. By the end of my 2nd month I made over $3,000 just following this system. If you search google for sports betting systems you will find the system there. If you bet on sports at all you gotta check this system out.
