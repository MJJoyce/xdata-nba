Super Gman08::The Pistons are a LEGIT coach and a good wing player from being a good, competitive team in the East. B. Knight is good and will get better, same for Monroe and Drummond (injured right now). Add a good wing (think Danny Granger, Nicholas Batum or Wilson Chandler type player) and some QUALITY role players, get rid of selfish volume shooters like Bynum and Stuckey, and you would have something to work with. I'm thinking a teaching/motivational coach like John Calipari maybe???
icebird753::maybe phil jackson, and sign chris paul this summer? keep dreaming
M-Squad123::i knew the pacers and knicks were going to win but im so happy that the hawks bulls and celtics all lost which is great for the nets
JetWing34::Detroit may be the worst team in the NBA. I don't care if they play Washington or Charlotte, they have no team spirit.
dukebd31::They have no talent and the worst Coach and GM in the league....I thought the Lions were bad, WOW the Pistons are Terrible, and will never be on top again, with this new era of players pick where the play... Who the heck will come to Detroit?
ASentientCheeselog::The Nets are finally starting to play the way their roster says they should, with the playoffs approaching.  People shouldn't sleep on them in the post-season.
Super Gman08::AGREED
ALLforthelulz::45 shot attempts for Detroit's guards while Monroe is 8 for 10. uh
JonahNYC::Jerry Stackhouse with a turn-back-the-clock game.
Super Gman08::Against his former team.... or one of them, LOL
batennisstud::@woyplate
Noles506::If the Knicks lose, the Nets would be first in the Atlantic. Wouldn't that be a first?
Rezo201::Tied
zinserdavidbulldog::Draft Trey Burke, add Andre Iggy in FA. Starting 5: Trey Burke--Jose Calderon Brandon Knight--Rodney Stucky Andre Iggy--Kyle SIngler Greg Monroe--Jason Max Andre Drummond---Big K  Thats a hell of a rotation and if meshes, could be title contending teams in years to come.
bamberg1977::There's a reason Burke isn't in most Drafts top 20. And I thought that before I looked last season. Great feel for the game, instincts, skill. But his anticipation and feel make him appear more athletic than he is in college, he just knows how to set people up with hesitation most college kids dont have. He's small and below avg. athlete for an NBA PG. We'll see, I think he's a career 6th-7th man if he works out.
Noles506::And Jose is as good as gone, nothing more than a salary dump for them.
bamberg1977::I think they would love to resign him if he fits. I think he fits great offensively. Trouble is on D pistons need help and he's part of problem. But w/Drummond maybe he could fit.
Noles506::Pistons management has no clue what they are doing. Last time they had cap space they signed Ben Gordon &amp; Charlie V... those were the big splashes.
zinserdavidbulldog::Their both really serviceable guys off the bench and I would love them to have that role. I do think Max is out after this year though.
Philip3664::Jason Maxiell should be gone and Stuckey should be gone.
_DespicableMe_::Hawks and Bulls lost.  Lets go Jazz!  Lol
mdog11abc::Close game
2215Tommy::Pistons aren't even trying anymore these days. Obviously playing for the lottery pick, but I wish they could at least act like they are trying.
Dustin-32::ever since we let go of Chauncey and Flip Saunders...it has been painful to watch
retiredat23::Just came back from the game ($45 seats for $10).....this team is just plain awful. Yes, they clearly miss Knight &amp; Drummond, but they also miss talent and cohesion - both of which they have little of.  Dumars better have an ace up his sleeve this summer b/c its not supposed to take 5 years to rebuild....and still be rebuilding.
KMartKidd56::Did you participate in the Mirza cheering section?
P.Richards68::Fan of the arkansas razorbacks? like discussing sports? do you hate zeke_in_kc? come join us at http://www.hogfans.net
southbeachginja::This is one of those times you just really want the aba back
45224_CollegeHill_Cincinnati::weak @ss detroit
Philip3664::Cincinnati lol
southbeachginja::Michigan fans are so sensitive.  Literally, I am in almost every single top comment there for saying that South Dakota State could pose a threat
NYChe21::Well their state is ummmm.....struggling to say the least.
southbeachginja::actually go to their board, they just love me in michigan
Philip3664::unnecessary...
t casey::I can't wait until Drummond comes back. Knight too. At least we should be respectable then.
southbeachginja::knight makes your team a joke.  Always getting murdered on top plays
NYChe21::Go Jazz!
KMartKidd56::THIS..  shoutout to NetsDaily too.
Hockey4eva925::wow just wow....
runninrebels3512::I remember when this was Jason Kidd vs. Chauncey Billups. The days.
dwade grater den jordan 11.0::its a shame 2 see detroit so bad... get ur D back!
pistonfanstill::I said this the moment Lawrence Frank was mentioned as a possible head coach, no team hiring this NBA Groupie is serious about winning championships.  How appropriate tonight it was the Nets, the one he transformed from a NBA Finalist to the hole of Lottery-Land they are just now escaping from.  Good ahead and blame the players and injuries, Frank is a fraud.
KMartKidd56::Nets are going to get L.Frank fired twice lmao
DTownSportsLions::We suck
KenHarris01::The Kings had fans before last season?
retiredat23::Yes we do
dwade grater den jordan 11.0::do wish u had lebron?
southbeachginja::runninrebels3512, Don't forget the giants
Hockey4eva925::how are all your roots from New York and LA???? lmao plzzzzzz....
DTownSportsLions::You're an interesting troll
dwade grater den jordan 11.0::all my roots r from their, bud
runninrebels3512::Yankees, Heat, Miami Hurricanes, LA Kings. That's a bandwagon fan if I've ever seen one.
DTownSportsLions::Yes
djny2k12::Humphries and Bogans.....40 pt. lead and still log DNP's
retiredat23::Wow
NYChe21::hurt....supposedly
dwade grater den jordan 11.0::Perdicshuns for the Rest of NBA seson   1. HEAT streak goes 2 28  2. NUGETS are the SUPRISE end up in finals. most pashonate team 3. KNICKS r joke of NBA 1nce again, Amare is loss. nets go 2 2nd round 4. durant becomin fave of refs.. okc loose in WCF  5. LA swept in 1st round.. wat failure   just my 2 sense tho- take it or leave it
DTownSportsLions::Bro, I know you cannot be serious with that spelling. You're looking for attention.
dwade grater den jordan 11.0::i tipe on tablits who cares
runninrebels3512::I wonder how disheartening it must be to be the guy who tweets for the Pistons account
Skippydoo5.0::He does it from a bathtub full of jello... Could be worse
trademarktaz::i'm praying that the pistons can get mclemore. attendance is down, david stern help us!
Hi There_::Bobcats want mclemore so pistons would need to get the first pick.
TheJTram::Oladipo or Porter
Grand212::Porter
retiredat23::He'll be long gone by the time the Pistons draft 8th again
djny2k12::Atleast hawks lost to the mavs...which is who the nets face next....mavs are playing well.
TheJTram::So um good game? #FireFrank, and #BanFrank
Grand212::I would rather have Anne Frank as my coach.
southbeachginja::wtf does that mean?
NjFan11::BROOOOK-LYNNNNN
Skippydoo5.0::In da house !!!
djny2k12::This team is so frustrating to watch......they are so unbelievably inconsistent from game to game. Just last night they absolutely collapsed in the 4th qtr. .........just don't know what to expect from them on any given night
dwade grater den jordan 11.0::dnt sux as bad as knicks tho
mcintyredavid::pistons could have used jeff green tonight
retiredat23::OR talent
dwade grater den jordan 11.0::NETS R beyand pretendiers its funny  just my 2 sense tho
runninrebels3512::What?
runninrebels3512::pretty much sums up the intelligence of the average Heat fan
dwade grater den jordan 11.0::cuz im tipin on my brand new tablit??
TheJTram::You know our coach sucks when we can keep track on how many blow out losses we had....
runninrebels3512::I love these boards. I switch over to the Heat-Celtics board and it is just the scumsuckers of America commenting on the Heat.
mojart::pistons should just forfeit their remaining games........coach is a joke
mcintyredavid::i know. i look at the standings quite a bit. i don't understand how 5 teams can be worse than the pistons.  this draft sucks anyhow.
Grand212::I still don't know how we have a better record than some teams.
Hi There_::Suns, Kings and Hornets would have MUCH better records if the played in the East.
TheJTram::Damn we took more abuse than Michael Vick's dog....literally
Grand212::Hmmmmmmm
mattcowboys77AD::wow uh...was not that bad!
TheJTram::This is our 18th...count it 18th blowout loss
ahdeeeeeeeeer::Heat suck and LBJ is horrible
aaron.bro_::If Stackhouse can go 4-5, Jordan can go 13-15
mcintyredavid::i know detroit has quit this year, but the draft isn't that good to be embarrassed this many times.  don't know if the players quit on the coaching staff or the coaching staff told them to quit playing.
mojart::thank god it's over  -lawrence frank-
Mets2410::awesome win Nets! way to bounce back from last night and great start to the road trip! detroit fans future looks bright for you guys drummond and monroe looks to be front-court of the future in the nba
kingtai01::NOTHING is wrong with Drummond, its not long a term issue....
NYChe21::Drummond has back problems.  Not good.
xatwr36x::I will step forward and admit that I bet on the Pistons to cover.  Brilliant!  I'm not even mad.  I can't stop laughing.
xatwr36x::I made a mistake on the bet slip.  It's just hilarious.
TheJTram::Wth....who in their right minds would bet on us?
iNeeroX::1-0 starting the road trip GO NETS!
Philip3664::The massacre is finally over
Hi There_::Luckily we had Frank with all his knowledge about the Nets organization to keep the score below 40 points.
Philip3664::LOL
159Yanks::Nets win. 1 game down. 7 more road games to go for this trip
