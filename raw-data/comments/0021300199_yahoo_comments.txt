gary::The Suns played an outstanding game tonight on the road.  Great win!
Luxref Staff::Magic need to keep tanking to get a good draft pick.  No sense in winning because of the dominance of Miami right now.
BIG AL::More like Michael Carter Williams so far!
schmoe::The Suns are a playoff team with Bledsoe on the floor, closer to average when Dragic is running things. It's the defense and athleticism that are worlds apart.   Need to keep Eric healthy this year.
BHK::Victor Oladipo: Dwade before he learned how to shoot. + gazillion TOs
Hung::Oladipo is a turnover machine.
MrStar7::Dunlevy is not Nate Robinson the Bulls blew it by giving Nate up, The Clippers will be good in time but the Bulls were just revealed on how poor they're Backups are
clint::Ish if you could shootish a littleish you'd be goodish.
chin::Suns management want to tank, but the players want to win, thats why they take out Bledsoe..  the only surprise is that Gerald Green is playing his socks out and suns still win even when they throw in the Morris twins, Ish smith and Goodwin.
chuck d::I think Nicholson should play ahead of Harkless.
