damn334::This is the time of the season where we see what the clippers are made of. Is this team for real are still to young. Last night prove to me they are just to young but good http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZLsl4j6ZSk
mosesbyu::Great job Jimmer!
BlindMeZae02::im guessing there is no stoping blake griffin
Soonerhopeful1::And you would never want to trade Cuz for Griffin..?    Yes sir, and I also believe the moon is cheese...!
Psychrates::Griff was shutdown by cuz and did most of his dmg vs the bench. I know he's hella good. He got whooped on.
Clipshow07::We are still not playing good defense. Still sloppy on our rotations and getting killed by the high picks. We are going to continue to struggle against the good defensive teams until we ourselves can start playing some consistent defense. We have played zero defense in our last several games. We cannot always rely on our offense. VDN needs to really focus on defense and I'm just not seeing it right now....
UteHawkeyeBronco2212::Jimmer is such a beast!   Jackin those 3s!
49erProudFan1980::Clippers may lose to the lakers in the regular season but in a 7 game series the clippers, in my opinion, would win due to adding key players and depth.   Players like martin, simmons all add extra defense, rebounding and fire power.   All a recipe for success
bobby30303::Clips win but can't handle Kobe/Lakers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmlTrVha3M8
soldier00013::glad to see the clippers are the best team in L.A.
pioms::44 field goals / 30 assists for the Clippers. Impressive.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::GG clips. Not a good game, too many to's and bad defense. Hope we can upset the Lake show tomorrow. GN and later all, GO KINGS!
8SportMan::Fakers is so old dude...show some class.
ryan_leventon93::Because I'm sure you show so much class when talking sports.
kezmicdust::Good luck against the Fakers!
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::one more thing before I go, one of the things that really upsets me about Jimmer jockeys is that they think that the team hates him. Even after they went CRAZY for him hitting 3 3's. They like him, but the coach sucks at managing time
Psychrates::Evans and Thronton hate him AND IT. They've asked Smart to cut back both their minutes.
sklater::And they also asked that Jimmer has to live in Concord.  They also said Jimmer needs to sit in a different bus than them.  They also told coach that Jimmer needs eat at the little kids table.
chadwi12::i might concede u that.... but it will take more than a few bench outburst for me to know fully.... i want to see some swing passes
sac_squints::I'm out too. Later.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::GN, later
clippsallday::Alright Kings and Clippers fans, have a good one! See you guys tomorrow on the phoenix  Convo if ur on that. Good Luck against the Lakers tho, hope u win!
clippsallday::Thanks bro!
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::GN, GG, and GL. Thanks
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::If this kings team can play solid defense they can be a playoff team next season
SeahawkFanWOOHAA::Seattle Kings? 30 more losses and the Kings will be Sonics.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::not gonna happen Kings are staying home, go take the Bobcats
BLazEdTrailerz::lol. But the Kings have so much more potential. I'd rather root for IT than Kemba too....
Candy-Flippers mommy::Who else is happy that the Wolves lost tonight nd know that the other day was a fluke? haha
clippsallday::Who else is happy that the Wolves lost tonight nd know that the other day was a fluke? haha
sac_squints::Honestly, I like the Wolves. Maybe not the fans but I still like the team. I still miss Adelman a lot. Brad Miller used to be a favorite of mine and Rubio and Love are fun to watch together.
clippsallday::Hahaha i did that once to some racist dude today
Candy-Flippers mommy::me too
clippsallday::of*
clippsallday::Haha i accidentally flagged u instead up liking ur comment smh. nd yeaaa annoying as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
Candy-Flippers mommy::It doesnt work, I flagged you
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::np I think they have ignored the flag button, I push it all the time on trolls and it doesn't say flagged
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::Minny has a good team even if they don't make the playoffs this year, but they have some annoying fans
kezmicdust::Solid game by the Clippers in the end. First half it was obvious we had problems on D, but they picked it up 2nd half. Kings are tough prospect in Sacramento (and will be for many years to come!) so it was an impressive win.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::not a fan of teams being brought together(a lot of it is because of all the bandwagon fans), but I like the clips more than MIA or NYK
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::Top 5 picks for the Kings to draft? I have Davis and Robinson at 1 and 2
sac_squints::Those are my top two as well. Beyond that I'd love to see Michael Kidd-Gilchrist here. Not sure if he is going to stay in school though. Maybe Harrison Barnes but I haven't liked him as much as I thought I would in what little I've seen of him this year.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::yeah he seems to be disinterested at times but he can really play(HB)
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::We need a SF or PF in the lotto, especially if DMC stays at C
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::anybody here?
kezmicdust::I only "like" my own post after someone else has liked it, just so it doesn't look like I'm liking my own posts. Sad, I know. :)
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::there ya go
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::lol
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::that isn't my like
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::Kings need defense, I would love to get Davis
Psychrates::DMC already does. BOOGIE SMASH!!!
sac_squints::That would almost be cheating. The other teams would get about 1 rebound per night.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::yeah, him and DMC starting would be eating boards
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::i'm back
sac_squints::Here is the breakdown by unit: http://www.82games.com/1112/1112SAC2.HTM Hasn't been updated for about two weeks so it isn't won't be too useful though. actually this might not have even been the site. Oh well.
sac_squints::I'd almost forgotten about the Salmons as a starter era. Ugh.
PadresChargersClippers::Kings need a couple solid Defensive players, with that they can be scary.
CDH11153::Ya they can score a lot but can't stop any one
sac_squints::lol I used to listen to the Misfits back in the day. good memories
clipper_darrel_is_a_Lakers_spy::SWEET LOVELY DEATH I AM WAITING FOR YOUR BREATH..... LOVELY DEATH ONE LAST CARESS
clipper_darrel_is_a_Lakers_spy::WELL I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY...I KILLED HER BABY TODAY AND IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH TO ME AS LONG AS ITS DEAD
clipper_darrel_is_a_Lakers_spy::I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY..I R.APED YOUR MOTHER TODAY AND DOESN'T MATTER MUCH TO ME AS LONG AS SHE SPREAD
clipper_darrel_is_a_Lakers_spy::Bobby Simmons having a solid game.  Lets hope he continues providing a spark off the bench.
itsatrap123::I'm no Kings fan (although I began to follow them a little after they drafted Thompson who played at a rival MAAC school and began to follow them a lot more once Jimmer got drafted) but the main idea I get is that they like Jimmer but don't like his fan base. I imagine it gets annoying (sorry) after a while. That being said I don't understand why the guy doesn't get more minutes. That also being said IT has earned his playing time-best kept secret in the 2011 draft. Like I've asked before why don't Jimmer and IT play on the floor together more often? Switch Jimmer to shooting guard, something he's accustomed to because IT seems to have the point nailed down. Anyways I hope some Kings fan can give me some more of an input here.
Psychrates::That team was only good when IT AND JImmer were out on the floor.
CDH11153::How much have they used it. I will have to look for the stats. Maybe give it more of a chance. Not just a couple of minutes here and there
sac_squints::trying to find the numbers now
sac_squints::Smart has run that lineup a few times in the past and for a bit tonight. It is reasonably efficient on offense but terrible on defense (I don't remember which site has the stats, but it breaks down every possible combination of players and rates offense and defense of the unit). And offense isn't as much of a problem as defense is so I don't think that they should use it often.
CDH11153::Everyone says Jimmer will get killed by the 2 on the defensive end. But I dont see the other 2 stopping anyone either!!! I like that idea ride the hot hand of which ever shooter is on!!!
itsatrap123::I mean that would be the logical solution, wouldn't it? Whoever is hot leads the way. It sounds like that hasn't been happening in Sacramento. Keep in mind I live on the East Coast though and really only follow games through this website. Hopefully the Kings get better as I understand they're pretty young (Evans, Cousins, Thomas, Greene, and Jimmer I can all remember in the NCAA tournament in recent years).
rolando77::Don't hate Kobe and the Lakers like I used to. Life's too short. ...But, I don't mind that D. Wade went upstairs in the All-Star game. Still a little salty about the Western Conference Finals when Kobe's elbow was "fouled" by Bibby's nose.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::i'll be right back
Jg2.o::Why is the Clipper front office telling Clipper Darrell to go away? Classy. He was your only fan for the past 15 years.
Psychrates::He is making money. $@%!, he's a lifelong Clips fan. They should pay him.  Notice how it's only an issue now that they're winning.
t casey::lol He was there for all the bad years and now they want him gone? Crazy.  I know it's not the end of the world, but I'd feel kind of insulted if I was the guy.
PadresChargersClippers::Apparently they think he's "profiting" off them.
rolando77::Sactown just has too many turnovers, soft D. The offense is decent. Glad they're staying put though. Used to live in Alkali Flats near the new arena location.
Psychrates::Alkali Flats, Land of the strung-out homeless. I lived 3 blocks from there as a child.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::yes
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::I like Jimmer and I think he could be a good spark off the bench, and tonight has earned more time tonight. He should get 15min tomorrow but probably won't. Smart isn't racist he just sucks at giving out time. Even though he torched my college team, I want him to stay. That said, if Jimmer jockeys are gonna keep being this annoying, I might want him traded
CDH11153::I watched the Jazz run Hayward off screens the other night again and again. I think Smart could make a good coach. But his rotations and inability to put players in situations where the thrive has been awful!!!!
CDH11153::Ya wasnt outlaw really good in portland too
CDH11153::I wonder why. I like him
sac_squints::he was better there. Looks like a d leaguer for us though
CDH11153::I wish they would use him like some of the old shooters give him some screens. Try to get him open looks if he is open he is nails. I have no problem with him coming of the bench. He could be a good scoring option off the bench. If he hits a couple of 3s and gets  hot look out.
Psychrates::I see him as Peja PG/SG
sac_squints::I'd like to see that too. Trouble is they almost never run screens for anyone. Hopefully that will change with time.
sac_squints::Agreed. Smart's weak in rotations for all players. It isn't just about Jimmer. For instance, Donte's lack of minutes tonight is more worrisome than Jimmer's imo.
Joe Raygor::He's a rookie, some rookies take longer than others to get their sea legs. Especially when a lockout wiped out training camp.
clippsallday::Cant lie that Cousins dunk on BG was pretty nice, might not have been literally on him, but it was powerful
Joe Raygor::Haters are a good thing. It means you're getting noticed.
PadresChargersClippers::Its a little annoying how ESPN is hyping BG up so much creating a lot of haters.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::def top 10 play over a BG dunk or CP3 drive
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::lol DMC drive and dunk WAS number 8, but now is out of the top 10 replaced by a drive by CP3 and 2 avg dunks by bg. ESPN SUCKS
Psychrates::A  PF taking his man off the dribble, then throwing the craziest looping dunk from  jusst outside the paint?  PLUS the target was of highest value.
Psychrates::bettter than griff's dunk on Perk.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::not sure about that, but top 10 material
Psychrates::HE SMASHED him too.
billyblackwood::I love how Jimmer Jockers can't even be happy when their team is winning with a guy that was picked dead last int he draft lol He's allowed to have a bad game, and the Clips are clearly a better team.
chadwi12::billy one thing is for sure, it is not what ur saying it is..... ur just plagerizing what u have heard others say about fredette... he is as good as any other king on this team... tell me one time where he has gotten lit up.. once... the game, the player, and a little detail please... when has he been so epically bad..
Chad86159::u know good and well after reading my comments all season, that i know way more about basketball than you... dont even try it sucka
BLazEdTrailerz::It's becoming obvious that you do not know much about basketball if you continue to deny the fact that Jimmer is a defensive liability. I mean... he made Jordan Crawford look like Michael Jordan... They clearly started to run their offense through Crawford as soon as they realized who was guarding him.  He had some nice plays last night against Foye and Mo Williams, but got shut down by Chris Paul when he started heating up. He had a boneheaded play to end the half when he drove into traffic and tried to pass the ball to nobody in particular while hoping for a foul.... he also had 2 back-to-back turnovers that completely killed momentum. On defense, he gets completely lost in the zone and can't fight through a pick to save his life...
billyblackwood::The FACT is Jimmer is not a good defensive player, never been his game. I like Jimmer, I'm not one of the ones saying he's just another Adam Morrison or JJ Reddick but that hurts his NBA game no doubt about it. IT is a rookie he's going to have turnovers trying to make things happen, but he's a much better defensive stopper (see Kobe game earlier this season and John Wall game) It is what it is.
Joe Raygor::Adam Morrison.  Has more rings than LeBron James, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Allen Iverson
CDH11153::Is everyone allowed to have bad games??? For some that gets you benched. IT wasnt that bad tonight but Evans good grief man quit shooting the ball!!!!!! 18 points is not impressive when you have to have 21 attempts to get it!!!
billyblackwood::Dude Thomas is just a rookie! He's only going to get better. Frankly I'm shocked he's been this good since starting. This kid may be short but dude can ball!
sac_squints::That drives me crazy. He is one good midrange option away from being an all star. As is defenders know that he will drive to the paint so they just clog and wait for him to throw up a circus shot. A floater, stop and pop, whatever. He just needs a shot that will draw defenders out of the paint. It'll make things easier for Cuz too.
JBurhenn253::ya obviously isaiah couldve cut down on turnovers but 10 pts on 4 shots and 5 rebs isnt too bad
TyrekeTheKing13::its when jimmer outplays isaiah but doesnt get the minutes he deserves
JBurhenn253::everybody has a lucky game. haha. im just playing. jimmer played well tonight
TyrekeTheKing13::oh well good game clips.... good game jimmer and cousins..... it was fun to watch... lets beat the lakers!!!!!! BEAT L.A.
Joe Raygor::I sure wish I was in SD now.
clippsallday::Same here, I live in SD!
clippsallday::Haha plz beat LA! :)
PadresChargersClippers::A little off-topic but I don't like L.A and would appreciate it if the clippers moved down to SD again.
PadresChargersClippers::Kings fans are pretty cool, unlike the Timberwolve trolls.
clippsallday::I gotta say kings have the coolest nd realest fans nd they dont joke much bout lebron nd kobe haha
Joe Raygor::Lakers trolls?
TyrekeTheKing13::timberwolve fans are the worst
TyrekeTheKing13::also bad
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::Heat fans, knicks fans
Joe Raygor::Jeez, did I accidentally wander into a Jimmer Fan Club meeting?
Joe Raygor::I got no personal issue with the kid, just the endless Jimmer Debate here is starting to grate me a bit.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::yeah i know
CDH11153::VERY SELFISH TEAM
Mikecito::It's always like this.  He's like Ron Paul.  Some really good things about him, but he'll never be on top because he doesn't get the chance he needs.
Mikecito::hahaha, does that offend you?
slamdrunk47::please dont compare ron paul to jimmer
tjugs6::You wandered into a war about a bench player. People hate him and then people try to defend him. The problems are much deeper for the kings. They have the worst chemistry I have ever seen in an NBA team. 4/5 starters want to shoot every time they touch the ball and their defense is just awful
PadresChargersClippers::Is he not the only white dude on the team?
slamdrunk47::yeah and after the meetings done here they are going to proceed to beating their 12 wives
chadwi12::says the guy with the proud name of slam drunk lol
TyrekeTheKing13::hahahahahahhahahahha OH MAN THAT JOKE.... sucked
sac_squints::You walked in on the Jimmer Fan Club walking in on the Kings Fan Club
JBurhenn253::yep, welcome. its very irritating.
TyrekeTheKing13::did you?
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::it's jimmer fans attacking kings fans because they think our coach is racist, you see it everyday
Mikecito::You forgot to put "the only" between "isn't" and "racist"
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::the coach isn't racist
Mikecito::So if it was 4 white guys on the floor, and 1 black guy, you wouldn't call racist when no one would pass to him, and if he got benched every time he got on a roll?
Psychrates::Coach aint racist. Evans and Thornton fear for their jobs, and pressure Smart into limiting time for both Jimmer AND Zeke.
TyrekeTheKing13::wow jimmer doesnt play bad D thomas thornton and evans got burned so much more than jimmer tonight
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::the entire team sucks on D
TyrekeTheKing13::exactly
clippsallday::Who else hates it when people hate on lebron nd kobe cuz their the best in the game nd than all they do is make stupid jokes about them. smh i mean i understand 1 joke is ok, but not 99344544. lol
clippsallday::Seriously tho, how do u know lebron choked? Maybe the mavs series was a fluke cuz last time i checked he dominated the rest of the playoffs!
gt1master_ike::I agree with clipsallday.  I make jokes on both players but if they ever come to my team,  OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WEEEEEEEEEEE
clippsallday::Kobee makes millions Lebron makes Billions nd u work at Jack in the box? lmaoo
PadresChargersClippers::I heard somewhere that a guy by the name of Scalabrine was the best in the game?
slamdrunk47::kobes a rapist and lebron chokes in the 4th qtr no hate just facts
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::10/5/4 with 6 to's for IT 11/3/2 with 3 to's for Jimmer
CDH11153::Looks like he was missing from every where
CDH11153::Ya so is going to get benched for a couple of games. Maybe smart will tell him he needs to be more selfish and shoot more. If Evans ever quits shooting!
JBurhenn253::was evans shooting a lot of jumpers or was he missing at the rim?
JBurhenn253::im gonna do what most jimmer fans like to do and multiply his mins to equal isaiahs and multiple his stats as well. if jimmer played as much as isaiah tonight he wouldve had at least 7 turnovers. how you like that one jimmer jocks
Psychrates::Those are Lin #s!
JBurhenn253::appreciate that chadwick
JBurhenn253::ya i got that but thats my point, you cant just do what i did.
chadwi12::its fine if u add every thing else to stupid shcmuck
CDH11153::Yep and he would of scored 25 or so and had 7 or so dimes!!! Works both ways man
CDH11153::31 mins 13 mins
JBurhenn253::cool, we can all list stats. isaiah took less shots, how ya like that one?
JBurhenn253::I wasnt able to watch the game tonight so Ive got to ask, what was keeping zeke from getting more shots up? good defense? looking to get others involved? i saw he had 6 to's which he could improve on but we all know he can score in bunches so he's gotta get more shots up.
CDH11153::Rookies will have off nights like this. It doesnt help if they get their minutes cut because of it. Sometimes you have to let them play through it!!
sac_squints::He looked off in general and Clipper's perimeter D prevented him from getting many shots up
CDH11153::I think Evans took all his shots for him
gt1master_ike::clipsallday  i know butler can produce like that every night but did you see his feb splits?  HE was shooting 39 percent from the field, 12 PPG in 31 minutes.  Nice to see him bounce back
clippsallday::Yeaa bro I feel u on that!
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::IT had a bad game and Jimmer outplayed him in less min, but everybody has a bad game.
ThrowAboutNothing::I'm starting to worry about Jimmer.  Anybody else think he has started drinking tea heavily since leaving BYU?
chadwi12::talkaboutnothing stop plagiarizing  cause ur not watching the games
CDH11153::I dont think there was any D played tonight
Mikecito::Yeah, it wasn't just Jimmer.
sklater::You got any jewish jokes, islam jokes, chinese jokes, black people jokes, baptist jokes, ...
ThrowAboutNothing::What joke?  I'm just trying to think of why Jimmer's D is so bad.  Or has it always been this bad?
sklater::What do you think?
