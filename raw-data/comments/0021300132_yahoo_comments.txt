gary strong::This was Plumlee's first real defensive test and he failed. This is why they need Len and Okafor ready to do battle. This game would have been different if Okafor were able to put in 10-15 defensive minutes. Plumlee's got to watch the tapes after this game.
Frank::Hoping my Brooklyn Nets are NOT the Toronto Blue Jays of the 2013-2014 NBA season!  What started out with so much promise...  PS- I miss PJ and how he sets rotations.
bodhibo::Mr. Williams continues to decline while Mr. Favors in Utah appears to be emerging as a superb player.  Now it is clear that the biggest mistake the Nets made was investing in Mr. Williams rather than hoarding draft picks and building a team slowly.  This lifelong Nets fan is eager for this team to fail so the new era can begin and the owner can be humbled.
tim n::nets are an old team old superstars dwill is not taking over, if they figure out how to play together they could be really good
buster vester::Another epic fail defense by Channing Frye!
bgood2life::The Nets should seriously try to trade D.Williams For Lin and Asik. He and Howard would finally get the chance to play together. What excuse do you think they will give,when they fail to win. The league reshape the ball.
heze::Blatche -15 in 18 minutes. Epic. Why is this guy getting any playing time?
Mauro::3 and 5 is a lot better than 2 and 6, an 0 and 3 West coast trip followed by a dreary 5 hour flight home. Big win.
Jaella::net solve the puzzle
Trix::whats it like being a nets fan anyway
