hazman023::I know its only 2 games but notice how the players "feel like their playing on the same page" for the first time or even how SVG said of the philly game "This is the best I've felt about this team the entire year", HEDO WASN'T PLAYING!!!!!!!
Dwayne_Johnson23::Get 'em JJ!
FranciscoKern::Have the Magic scored over 100 points in a game this year?  Hmm . . . and DHowie was sittin' on the bench with his back owie.
BowenDT71::Well here's the thing with Orlando. They either score 100 points in a game or 50.
Paul96857::Ali44, I think this team has been running great since he said http://bit.ly/IdCjtx
AussieRaven_::so Orlando beat Detroit by 30 points!! and didnt make the front page of ESPN    but Lebrick did even though James Jones hit 6 3pters
UncleRuckus87::Orlando beat Detroit? You think thats worth praise?
knowlto::No, his point is that it wasn't worth praise when LeBron did it either.
csmeech::This is why turk should be a bench player (if you must play him at all).  They play much better without him clanking shots off the rim.  Seriously hedo, retire already.  You're done!
beebopbaloop::Hedo's wife is a hottie.
Southbound29::Glen Davis has really stepped up since Howard has been out and struggling due to having his period. Since Davis has said he does not like the "Big Baby" nickname and he has since proved he can play and step up when needed he will now be known as Glen "I Likes Me Cookies" Davis.
Javy Jeter::why howard didn't play?
Saintsfan601MS::No way the Magic make it out of the first round without Howard to think otherwise is extremely foolish whether you like Howard or not.....
Saintsfan601MS::JJ Reddick has really improved I remember when he first came in he didn't seem like he would be as good as he was in college in the pros...he's finally gotten used to the NBA and he's balling now..
HateBrass::Tom Gores, bring Isiah home and put him in charge of your scouting department.
aaronearl365::The Magic are better without Howard.
Saintsfan601MS::so dumb
TheCronoMasterMind::Very nice game without Howard guys! I really hope the Magic will keep this up for the rest of the season. They played with great energy the entire game, had some nice defense, and the ball movement was better than expected without Turk or Howard. Keep this going if you want a deep playoff run.
jmoneyisback::Dwight howard sat out with v.agin.a  spasms?
LaFuriaRojaESPANA::callate
Sparty_2013::So glad that the last two times my Pistons have played my favorite player's team (Dwight Howard-Orlando) he hasn't played. So I changed the channel both times. I love my Pistons but missed both games.
KashMunee::Amir Johnson, PF 33 7-9 1-1 1-2 3 4 7 3 1 0 0 2 -1 16 ............Gone from Detroit but NOT forgotten
KashMunee::Arron Afflalo, SG 36 6-14 1-2 2-2 3 8 5 1 0 3 1 +32 15 .......GONE from Detroit but NOT forgotten
KashMunee::To Detroit fans: Cruel people get their power from the way you respond to their pressure. Your life happiness is in danger from people, especially fans from successful NBA teams  who chip away, harp, nag and aggravate the life out of you,  YOU CANNOT FIGHT THEM WITH RESENTMENT, Take heart. There is not a single problem that you cannot solve if you become a BossTown Celtic fan. Life becomes bearable, soothing and beautiful. Solve all of yer anger problems. Become a BossTown Celtic fan and breathe easier
KashMunee::Orlando fans SUCK..... Free Howard
Edawg7115::Your an  idiot.     He opted IN.   Stop trolling and keep your mouth shut FA.990T
KashMunee::Dwight Howard's decision to relinquish his right to opt out of his contract at season's end was supposed to bring peace to the Magic Kingdom for the rest of this season at the very least. How long did the happiness last? Thanks to Stan Van Gundy's shootaround candor, here's your answer: Not even a month.
jmoneyisback::I'm pretty sure what happened is Dwight's fault.
d3lb3rtl33::That parlaybeater kid must be 12 years old. He's seriously clueless.
d94ware9::If Thunder stayed in Seattle theres no way they'd have more wins considering OKC hasn't been to the Finals yet. It'd be the same team in Seattle. The Bad Boy Pistons won a few with Thomas. Then they won in 04 after beating the Lakers who had 3 first ballot Hall of Famers.
KashMunee::Adaye5 Austin Daye How to Lose 20 lbs. of Fat in 30 Days   but he's got time to twitter
BowenDT71::I'm out guys. DetKoolAid night man same goes to a_tizzy. Bear or Beater keep posting those "Facts" of yours.
a_tizzy::take care man
BowenDT71::lol oh my god his name isn't bear its beater.
adeeblack::119 points without Dwight Howard ? Looks like Ron Jeremy got his point across.
ceburch151::based on the box score, this game looks like it was close. . .
DetKoolAid::god being on this board just made me feel really old, a bunch of young kids on here just saying stuff thats not true and arguing it lol im out good luck orlando hope you can get out the 2nd round this year, maybe erase that goose egg that you have in the championship column
BowenDT71::See ya DetKoolAid. Good luck rest of the season.
BowenDT71::lol I don't know about that. I'm a Knicks fan btw. But (get this) Isiah Thomas was my child hood hero along with Michael Jordan and Ewing so I just need to prove Beater wrong. Still good luck and the guy is wrong, you could build around Monroe. Had fun proving Mr. Beater wrong.
DetKoolAid::night man i actually like orlando but some fans wreck my head when it comes to this stuff lol with everyone healthy they should be a legit threat in the playoffs
BowenDT71::Also this just in, getting to the finals is bad. Bear realize one thing and I'm sure we agree on this one. Going to the finals is always good, win or lose, unless you're the Miami Heat who deserve to get bashed for not winning a title with 2 top 5 players on their team.
BowenDT71::So more wins and more championships. Gee guys I wonder which franchise is superior?
a_tizzy::idk man, if the grizzlies stayed in vacncouver they may have more wins than the pistons right now... [sarcasm]
BowenDT71::lol
DetKoolAid::parlaybeater702 So making the playoffs...AND NOT HAVING A CHANCE AT A RING IS WHAT THE MIGHTY PISTONS FANS LOOK UPTO NOW LOL...You still haven't answered my question...PROVE TO ME THAT IF THE THUNDER STAYED IN SEATTLE..THAT SEATTLE WOULDN'T HAVE MORE WINS THAN THE PISTONS....I REPEAT I'LL WAIT ------------------------ http://mcubed.net/nba/fwtot.shtml     Franchise                       Wins     Finals          Playoffs      W             L   Detroit Pistons                        3           7              39           2457     2517 Oklahoma City Thunder         1           3              24           1873       1703
Elton7323::nope because of the dramatic coaching change and young talent made okc so dominate right now. so detriot is done for like 7 years.
BowenDT71::I tried to read it, but it just doesn't seem to have a point.
DetKoolAid::i am so damn confused at his comment lol
BowenDT71::What?
DetKoolAid::theres your proof its not hard to find this out, but i guess its easier for you to just talk out your a$$ since you dont really know sh*t
DetKoolAid::yep well hey pistons one step closer in the lottery and we have the tigers on tomorrow
BowenDT71::Check mate bear. Now its 10 O'clock eastern time. Go to bed.
DetKoolAid::parlaybeater702 This makes u the Atlanta Braves of the NBA......NOBODY REMEMBERS THAT BUT DETROIT FANS...JUST LIKE NOBODY REMEMBERS WHOS IN THE FINAL FOUR EVER YEAR ONLY THE WINNERS -----------------------------------  ok buddy you let me know when the magic win their 1st ring. the championship is for us the fans and the players so what do i care if you dont remember they won a ring in 04 and went back the following year?
a_tizzy::just like the fluke of cleveland making it and getting swept by the spurs, and the fluke of orlando making it and losing to the lakers? those finals trips are flukes, the 2005 finals was not a fluke, it went to 7 games and it was a grueling series.
parlaybeater702::AND LOST...like the fluke everyone knew they were
_MagiCanes_::Tampa Bay Bucs, Tampa Bay Lightning, FL Marlins, FSU football...all have won championships.  YOU FAIL!
BowenDT71::Yes its a fluke to lose to the San Antonio Dynasty in 7 games. Now I get it Bear.
DetKoolAid::they won in 04 you let me know when someone outside of the university of florida or miami wins something of importance
KashMunee::I can see why Detroit leads in hate crimes...i'd hate too if i was stuck there
BowenDT71::Black on black, white on white, black on white, white on black, it doesn't matter it is bad any way.
a_tizzy::murder is murder, don't try to make this into a hate message either
KashMunee::Theres a BIG difference between crime and MURDER....but you wouldn't know about THAT... and besides black on black murders ain't really that bad..now is it...cuz that IS what we are talking about y'kno...glad it ain't a big deal to you
DetKoolAid::number 3 which means there is a 1 and a 2 and a 4-100, sh*t happens everywhere! i am a 4th generation detroiter, i live there and have been good. i dont got frolicking in areas that are bad but i also wouldnt do that in chicago, miami, or new york either. you do you and you will be fine
KashMunee::sorry to burst you bubble of lies..i got FAMILY in Detroit...and it IS as i say it is....number 3 in the nation for black on black homicides per capita...yeah...but that don't matter to you...genicode is kool...right
DetKoolAid::no that is not what im talking about, i didnt bring any race into this. i like my family and millions more have been born and raised in michigan and are living great lives. stop listening to everything a poll or biased publication and media tell you
DetKoolAid::i love it here and have a great life, news flash every big city has its bad areas. Detroit isnt number 1 or 2 in crime (3 aint much better) but there is a top 10 list out there with other cities on it check em out, from chicago to compton to la and miami and new york crime happens every where
DetKoolAid::parlaybeater702 "Detroit has been bad since 06 &amp; you are still saying your rebuilding?" ------------------------  somebody help this dude, he obviously doesnt realize pistons made the playoffs from 03-2010 and has only missed the playoffs the past 2 years (will be 3 this year)
parlaybeater702::Like I said THE PISTONS HAVE NOT BEEN A SERIOUS CONTENDER SINCE 06...BUT LIKE MOST BAD TEAMS THE PISTONS FANS ARE HAPPY JUST BEING THE WARMUP TEAM FOR REAL CONTENDERS....WITH THAT BEING SAID YOUR DOING A GREAT JOB
BowenDT71::You're losing the argument at an outstanding rate, so thank you.
BowenDT71::He's 12 years old, what do you expect.
KashMunee::iF I WAS A pISSoN FAN.. i'd want my DRUGS
KashMunee::THIRTY POINTS... I mean...REALLY..gimmie my drugs...put in the iv NOW
DetKoolAid::yeah i wonder how magic fans feel actually losing the season series to the pistons
a_tizzy::ooh noooooo our playoff hopes are surely gone after this loss!
a_tizzy::it's frustrating but we'll live, 1pm tigers vs rays
DetKoolAid::naw we just get to watch the tigers, red wings, lions, UM/MSU teams thats all....we actually have footage of our teams winning championships what do the magic have?
BowenDT71::LOL @ parlaybear, what an idiot. Seattle with more history then the Pistons. Go to bed. You started watching the NBA what 2 years ago?
a_tizzy::pistons 2457 wins, thunder/supersonics 1873 wins. you can subtract the amount of wins the pistons had since the thunder moved if you really want to but I doubt it's more than 584
parlaybeater702::The fact still remains....I ASK YOU TO PROVE THAT THE PISTONS WOULD HAVE MORE WINS THAN THE SONICS IF THE THUNDER STAYED....DON'T WORRY I'LL WAIT
a_tizzy::yea seattle has 1 ring, but 3 finals appearances compared to pistons having 7
BowenDT71::Yeah so I think we proved him wrong.
BowenDT71::Detriot has 3 rings. Sonics 1. You already lost little boy. You don't even know what the Bad Boys era means. You think we are talking about a Will Smith movie.
BowenDT71::Ouch. Okay than 3-1
theprodctz::If we are to be pedantic though, the Sonics did win one back in the 70s
a_tizzy::proven wrong: http://mcubed.net/nba/fwtot.shtml
parlaybeater702::prove me wrong with facts...DON'T WORRY I'll wait....Like I said if the thunder were still in Seattle....THE SONICS WOULD BE AHEAD OF YOU IDIOT....NOW PROVE ME WRONG
KashMunee::Beaten by THIRTY POINTS
d94ware9::Magic are 1-0 without Howard in the lineup. Trade him.
cpajaysmith89::These same Pistons beat the Magic last week without Howard though?
AllFloridaGuy::LIONSBABY70 - and i dont want you to OD on drugs. what part of my statement upset you?  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Never done drugs in my life, actually. Doesn't upset me, actually, just telling you that you're statement looks kinda dumb.. It kinda looked like you couldnt read.. lol
DetKoolAid::people are $@%!$@%!, pistons came off of one of the best runs in the east ever and now you jump over board and say they should be contracted? orlando sucked for years, it happens. it has happened to everyone but san antonio spurs.   funny how high and mighty people get over a basketball game, its simple you win, then you rebuild  then you win again, happens all the time.  it sure beats trying to see who will come in second to miami, hell at this rate pistons will be good again at the end of the miami experience in a couple years and actually have a chance to win something unlike teams like orlando and atlanta who are just content making the playoffs
parlaybeater702::So making the playoffs...AND NOT HAVING A CHANCE AT A RING IS WHAT THE MIGHTY PISTONS FANS LOOK UPTO NOW LOL...You still haven't answered my question...PROVE TO ME THAT IF THE THUNDER STAYED IN SEATTLE..THAT SEATTLE WOULDN'T HAVE MORE WINS THAN THE PISTONS....I REPEAT I'LL WAIT
HateBrass::The only franchises to win titles in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s were LA and Detroit.
parlaybeater702::Detroit has been bad since 06 &amp; you are still saying your rebuilding? WHO ARE YOU BUILDING AROUND? Do you honestly think Knight &amp; monroe are gonna be your Future? FYI....Once Monroe can leave HE WILL LEAVE....and Knight SUCKS FACE IT...So AGAIN WHO ARE YOU BUILDING AROUND AGAIN?
HateBrass::How has Detroit been bad since 2006 when they played Boston in the 2008 ECF with the second best record in the east?
DetKoolAid::no actually detroit won a ring and got another finals apperance. that actually makes olando and atlanta the braves by never winning anything
parlaybeater702::This makes u the Atlanta Braves of the NBA......NOBODY REMEMBERS THAT BUT DETROIT FANS...JUST LIKE NOBODY REMEMBERS WHOS IN THE FINAL FOUR EVER YEAR ONLY THE WINNERS
BowenDT71::I guess getting to the ECF 8 years in a row and 2 finals appearances (1 win) not to mention ECF appearances in 08 means they have been bad since 06. Yeah Bear your right.
BowenDT71::Yes everyone he started watching basketball 2years ago. Go to bed young one.
DetKoolAid::detroit hasnt been bad since 06 wtf are you talking about we didnt miss the playoffs untill 2 years ago idiot loser. why are you on here trying to talk but you have no facts?
a_tizzy::idk what is even going on, I'm hitting my head on a wall in disbelief,..and take the first 24 games of this year out of the equation and they've been around .500. That's why they call it rebuilding.
DetKoolAid::i agree once again, i would hate to be good right now anyway with all these damn super teams, i just say learn to be a good team and get high draft picks so we can be good in the next wave of the nba when the miamis and okc's pass
a_tizzy::call it an extended training camp, we knew we weren't going anywhere this year anyway
DetKoolAid::i know exactly they are over .500 after that god forsaken 4-20 start...stuckey missed 10 of those games and prince was still injured. knight was just starting out with a new coach and monroe couldnt catch the ball with stuckum on his hands
CZA37110::When Dwight comes back... the lineup and rotations should be:  F J. Richardson, Turkoglu F Davis, Anderson, Clark C Howard, Davis, Orton G Redick, Q. Richardson G Nelson, Smith, Duhon  Defensive specialist for 2s and 3s: Liggins  Wake up SVG!
KashMunee::Singer WON'T play for Detroit..he went overseas to get away
parlaybeater702::Be honest.....He's a SMART DUKE KID....He knows his career would be over playing with these bums...Go over seas work on your game..comeback &amp; play for any other team in the league
a_tizzy::bc it was a lockout, it was better for him and better for the pistons that he gets some pro experience and strengthens his game
a_tizzy::you think he'd benefit from being on crowded roster like this one? name one benefit of him being on the team now compared to coming back next year when the rif raff is gone
KashMunee::Haaaahaaaahaaaa...better for the Pisssons....REALLY.. i mean REALLY you believe anything yer told by Dumars and company as they have their 4th losing season in a row... hmmmmmmmmm......i bet were NOT in a depression presently. and we're better off than we were 3 years ago...RIGHT Tommy
MagicBoltzRays::If OKC finishes off the Bucks, we're 3 wins away from clinching a playoff berth.
theprodctz::We're already in by default. Just a matter of what seed we end up as.  Not gonna lie though, I wouldn't mind getting the Pacers in a 3-6 matchup
DETROIT BABY26::NO HOWARD 30 PT LOSS GUYS AN IDIOT
DETROIT BABY26::GREG 23 MINUTES?
parlaybeater702::Contraction is needed in the nba....The Pistons are a complete waste....why would you watch this sorry team play
parlaybeater702::So Detroit has been rebuilding since 06? Hello that's 6 years ago...&amp; you still have no trace of being any good within the next 5 years
a_tizzy::06? they went to the ECF 06 07 and 08. 09 they traded chauncey and made the playoffs, 2010 and 2011 they were stuck with the owner dying and his wife not letting joe make any moves,
DetKoolAid::pistons been rebuilding for about 2 or 3 years now, they signed BG and Charlie V after they had great years for their respective teams thinking they would be good but hindsight is 20/20 they crapped out so the rebuild begins
parlaybeater702::It's called history....Seattle lost their team WITH A MUCH BETTER BASKETBALL HISTORY!!!
BowenDT71::3 rings to 0 and a lot more history and great players. The Bad Boys era by itself is better than most teams history.
DetKoolAid::parlaybeater702 - Detroit people are you really that dumb....Seattle hasn't had a team for the last 5 years...MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE MORE WINS DUMMY....If the thunder were still in Seattle...SEATTLE WOULD HAVE MORE  no they wouldnt idiot detroit has been in that position for years now, going way back to the bad boys days
parlaybeater702::Detroit people are you really that dumb....Seattle hasn't had a team for the last 5 years...MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE MORE WINS DUMMY....If the thunder were still in Seattle...SEATTLE WOULD HAVE MORE
DetKoolAid::wtf? seatlle is no where near detroit in terms of sports and what their franchises mean. the pistons have way deeper history than the sonics and are top 5 in the history of the nba in championships and wins
a_tizzy::is this serious right now? 4th best winning% in NBA history homie
DetKoolAid::lmao after 7 years of being one of the best teams in the east and actually winning a championship unlike orlando, the pistons should be contracted? they arent even the worst team in the league and actually beat orlando twice this year.   sorry teams have to rebuild lmao like orlando didnt suck for years
theprodctz::The Bobcats and Hornets should get the honors ahead of them, to be fair
theprodctz::Well done, Earl Clark.
DETROIT BABY26::LAWRENCE FRANK=$@%!$@%!
KashMunee::Detroit drafted Arron Affalo...cut him...he now STARTS for he Denver Nuggets
