Austin::This is kinda random, but do people actually like Ryan Hollins? It seems like no matter what team he plays for he just plays a couple minutes each game and tries to hack anyone near him. I remember Timmy Duncan giving Hollins the death stare after a hard foul in a game last season, and Timmy doesnt do that very often.   Hollins is probly the only guy i dislike on the Clippers, the rest of that team is built to be a contender.
Darth Apollyon::It is funny how people think that this is representative of how the Spurs will play in the playoffs.  They just do not seem to notice that Popovich and the Spurs are just cruising to the playoffs.  Absolutely winning the winnable games, not trying to hard on games where the opponents want to try and make a statement, as a way to not burned up to fast his aging core and limiting injuries. What Popovich is doing  is actually a principle of war.called Economy of Force, and with that principle he will cruise to a top spot in the playoffs with minimum calculated risks.
HIP2CLIP::I can't remember the last time I saw the Spurs manhandled like they were in the 2nd and 4th qtrs.
steve::Most questionable calls went the way of SA!
Clipperdude::Capt Jack out of basketball since before last years playoffs is starting to look good.
Yippy Yi Yah::D Jordan's gotta remember to leave all of that smiling after a tech, at home. Be a little more serious, will ya?
Steve Shear::This guy is one big idiot of course.
Homer Fudd Jr.::The Clippers could use improvement. Sign Cliff Paul to a 10 day contract!
Marilyn::man there's a lot of strange characters on here today.  do the clippers always bring these weirdos with them or are the just a bunch of trolls?
Commenter::FOR THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED- I WON'T COME BACK TO READ HATE REPLIES NOR COMMENTS POSTED ABOUT ME SO ENJOY REPLYING TO YOURSELVES & ENJOY YOUR STUPIDITY LOL  Looks like a blowout to me LOL. Like I said Spurs beat weak to average teams but the losses they have now are from elite teams. They can't beat the Thunder (7-2 in last 9 games vs Spurs), Heat, Pacers, nor Blazer in a best of 7 games. Spurs lack defense, lack 7 footers, lack rebounders, & rely on 3 pointers. Where were the Spurs fans when they CHOKED in the Finals? Prentis P, Tay, BB, Terry, Shaw, Phillip, Straitballin, Chapscat, Moses, Donald, proudveteranwoman, Guest, etc? I watched NBA for 27 years & I never seen a team so pathetic & choke like the Spurs. Double digit lead in the 4th, up by 5 with 28 seconds left, Leonard missed 1 freethrow to close out the Finals & Pop took out his rebounders & starters at the end like an idiot! They CHOKED as USUAL LOL. THIS IS THE 5TH SEASON I WILL SAY IT, SPURS WON'T WIN THE TITLE!  2014- Will CHOKE in the playoffs 2013- CHOKED in game 6 after having the game won & CHOKED against the Heat in Game 7 2012- CHOKED losing 4 straight games after winning 20+ games straight, best record in the west, & being up 2-0 with home court advantage. BIGGEST CHOKE IN HISTORY! PATHETIC! 2011- CHOKED in the 1st round to a 8th seeded team after having the best record in the west! PATHETIC! 2010- Swept by a non-defensive team 2009- CHOKED 1st round to a 6th seeded in only 5 games. PATHETIC! 2008- CHOKED in 5 games 2004- CHOKED 2nd round losing 4 straight games after winning 20+ games straight, best record in the NBA, & being up 2-0 with home court advantage. SAME AS 2012! BIGGEST CHOKE IN HISTORY! PATHETIC!  2002- CHOKED 2nd round in 5 games after Duncan having a mvp season 2001- CHOKED being swept after having best record in the NBA & all games were blow outs! PATHETIC! 1996- CHOKED in 5 games 1st round to a 7th seeded team. PATHETIC! 1995- CHOKED after having the best record in the NBA & Robinson winning MVP. Hakeem took him to school!
