Psuedohoax::Super impressed with Denver last night. The bearded old men from Dallas are in trouble tonight....
PACASANO::I think it is funny the Laker trolls have to come on Denver's board. Just to get any attention. Go watch ESPN. You get all the attention you need there.
Shaqs biggest fan::What the hell Denver?    The goal is to keep LA out of the playoffs not in!
Steve91406::I still thank Denver, and think the Lakers should do whatever it takes to beat Memphis tmr, for the good of themselves. Nuggets fans should hate Lakers by default, I am a Laker fan and I can completely understand why, but that doesn't mean Lakers should concede, although nothing really indicated they have much of a chance.
-tpac_12::A road win is really nice especially against a good team
I am a follower::"It's a solid win for us in a race that is probably going to go down to the last week," Nuggets coach George Karl said of battling for third place in the West. "In a way, I hate helping the Lakers, but now maybe they can help us."  Can you Lakers?  Huh?  Can you beat a REAL team to pay the Nuggets back???
diehardnr1::Hilarious that the Lakers fans have to come onto REAL playoff teams boards and spew their tripe...but what choice do they have when everybody totally ignores their fallen team?  If it wasn't so funny it would be sad...
MTN_HIGH_CO::Miller plays at "YMCA old man going to make you look bad" pace.
Hlee196::I think the Nuggets is this good, and the Jazz is just so bad...
luckywin7::Nuggests do ya want play against lakers on playoff ? jazz do  ya want play against lakers on playoff? Nuggests lose jazz win no lakers at playoff...damn get lakers off the board!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
whooperman::We want the 3rd spot, who cares about the fake show.
Pusherman3::Evan Fournier is going to be a nice player in the league.  Nice to see the kid get some run.
If Yur Not 1st Yur Last::Mosgov is a FA and they are going to let him go I bet; he's actually making a little more than Brewer.
gw687::Really contributing with his opportunity right now.  Makes me slightly sad b/c with Brewer being a free agent this year, the Nuggs can probably let him go and stay cheaper replacing his role with Fournier.  The way Fournier is playing now would seem to indicate that's the smartest role.  I just love Brewers energy and hustle, but understand you have to make the smartest decisions.  Still glad to see Fournier take advantage of an opportunity though.
whooperman::It would be sad to see c brew go...
16Lakers18::Lakers will be the scariest 8th seed team in the history of the NBA
BryHinkle::Do you seriously think that any of the top teams in the West are scared of the Lakers after stomping a huge mud hole in them all year?
whooperman::Ummmmm, no i think not.
whooperman::Trust you?  Your stupid enough to pay for insider hahahaha.
whooperman::Kid?  Blow me.  The lakers cant beat their way out of a wet paper bag right now.  They get destroyed by the top teams in the west every single time and somehow you say the playoffs will magically make their team chemistry and coaching better?  You are delusional.  nash is well past peak, Dwight is a cry baby and will leave for free agency after the year, and kobe cannot swallow his pride and pass.  Your team is fundamentally flawed and the playoffs will show that clearly.   Lakers lost their shot at another title in the next 5 years when they fired Brown and slighted the zen master.  Good luck with your mediocrity.
SandyBeachesinla::Playoffs are different story kid... Game slows down and teams would value every position.. thats where teams need low post players... Lakers happen to have 3 very good low post players in Gasol, Kobe and Howard,, Trust me ,No one wants to have Lakers as their first round opponent.
Pusherman3::Said no one, ever.
diehardnr1::and you really believe this?  But of course the talking heads will spew whatever garbage that will keep the LaLas nourished...and then they will cry and give excuses when Lakers fall....just like the LaLas will
16Lakers18::It will be said by every TV analyst if the Lakers get the 8th seed.  OKC and Spurs will start tanking their games to avoid them in the first round.
sbanuelo88::Not if they don't advance!
winnumber101::I think Golden State took that crown.
winnumber101::that team is at least 10 deep
MileHighLife::12 actually.
shut the front door please::The only X factor is how well Denver's offense can adjust in a playoff environment...they have the pieces to go all the way, it's just a matter of how well they can adjust to the slower pace. I'm rooting for the Spurs to win the West, but Denver-Miami would be mind-blowingly entertaining if it happened.
BurnabyJoeFan::Lakers are 17 games behind the Spurs who they will play in the first round.. yet their fans come in our game thread acting like they have won something.  The NUGGETS beat the Jazz.. just like they beat your team.  That's not a win for you.
JSatty03::Wow....yeah if you look at the names they have the peices...congrats on your greatttttt record. 7 Games and we would run you off the floor hands down...KOBE ADMITS IT! GET OVER YOURSELF
SandyBeachesinla::Mc Nuggets are a decent regular season team but dont have the horses to advance in Playoffs.. Lakers are starting to come together ,, Their record after all star break is 14-7 with 12 of those games being on the Road.. Biggest issue for Lakers is the back end of back to back which they dont have to worry about in playoffs
BryHinkle::5-5 in their last 10.  Considering the year they are having I can see how you would get the impression that they are starting to "come together".  They will be lucky to win 2 of their remaining games.
fred66121::Denver always chokes in the playoffs.
soulsnake::yeah, the jazz just doesn't have the horses to compete, but they have the heart to.  The fact that  they are even hanging in for the 8th spot is astounding.
SouthStands::Good game...the Jazz hung tough for as long as they could, but Denver just wears teams down. I think Utah has a great core to build on, but they're still a few pieces short.  Good luck the rest of the way Jazz fans...  GO NUGGETS!
cmanjones1515::Good win Nuggets always tough to pull one out of Utah. Just keep on chugging, and that 3 seed is all ours!
RRC24Kemba15::denver is always a tough out in the playoffs. this year wont be any different, esp once lawson gets healthy
Gator_Rican::I can't believe no one here is blaming the refs for Utah loosing. I bet if it was a closer game everyone here would be ref hating and claiming the refs are wanting the Lakers in. All of you are so predictable...
whooperman::Ya the nuggets are too good for that nonsense.
Finnegan5033::C'mon Jazz, if you lose out the final spot to the Lakers you are letting the entire country down! Except of course Laker fans, but I'm sure everyone else would love to see the Lakers miss the playoffs
whooperman::I refuse to acknowledge that faker nation is associated with the USA.
RRC24Kemba15::yet you just aknowledged it...
fred66121::Now I'd love to see the Lakers knock Denver out of the playoffs.
whooperman::Or how about this; the lakers team plane collides with the justin bieber tour plane over denver and we all dance in the streets as the wreckage rains down like fireworks.  That is awesome c'mon.
jaer04::hhahahahhahah O my $@%!$@% god dude
whooperman::I'd love to see a meteor hit the staples center during a lakers player-fan rally.  I dont even know if they have those but it sounds great to say.
jaer04::LOL Now I think thats funny
jaer04::yes $@%! you fred 66121
fred66121::Not even a Laker fan...but I do know Denver chokes everytime in the playoffs. When was the last time they even played in the Finals?
BurnabyJoeFan::It's not choking if you don't have the talent on the team.  Fred is a joke.
jaer04::o were did sissy $@%! Fred66121 go huh LOL
whooperman::Not even a laker fan, a bandwagon faker fan.
jaer04::the WTF thing was toward WHOOPERMAN
whooperman::You either dont know much about statistics or nuggets playoff history, wither way your an idiot.
jaer04::WTF that makes no sense of what we were talking about good job A hole
fred66121::somebody getting mad?
fred66121::Denver always chokes in the playoffs...always. lmao...they arent getting anywhere near the Finals.
BurnabyJoeFan::A stupid comment by fred.  The Nuggets have if anything overachieved several years for the talent they had on their team.  1. Knocking #1 Seattle out of the playoffs as a #8 Seed 2. Advancing to the Western Conference Finals with essentially this years Knicks team (which won't go that far) 3. Taking the Lakers to 7 games last year with a young new team.  But you don't really know anything about Basketball.. so whatever..  call anyone who doesn't win the Championship Chokers.  You are a joke.
whooperman::Everyone knows you got a gift from the refs in game 4 of the first round last year.  Only a laker fan would call 7 games against a team and their referees a choke.
whooperman::I would love to have sex with megan fox, it is not ever going to happen, but as long as we are throwing out impossible scenarios.
whooperman::Since more than half of the teams in the league make the playoffs the odds would be much more like getting within the closest 4 billion guys she would choose, that is about the odds the lakers are looking at.
fred66121::Get within 8 guys she would choose than you have a fair comparision since its 8 teams in the western conference playoffs.
jaer04::No its going to be Denver vs Miami Heat and Miami will win again
fred66121::And Kobe isnt as good as Ray Lewis at his perspective sport?
jaer04::well yeah I didnt think the ravens would win but they pulled it off b/c of Ray Lewis
jaer04::NOT happening
VicksBestDawg::1 game &lt; 7 games.
fred66121::never know...I bet you thought the Ravens wouldnt win the Super Bowl either.
VicksBestDawg::Lakers have 6 out of 7 at the Staples Center to finish. Jazz have 3 out of 6 at home. Jazz will likely go 2-4 to finish the season (splitting with the Timberwolves, losing to OKC/Memphis/GSW) and finish 41-41. So, the Lakers need to finish 3-4 to get the 8th seed.   Portland and @New Orleans are likely wins for the Lakers. So, they need to get one win out of: Memphis, Clippers, GSW, San Antonio, and Houston all at Staples. I'd be shocked if they don't get at least one win, at home, from one of those teams.
charlie hustle bets the over::Not so fast, of the lakers remaining games, 5 are vs western conference playoff teams, who have owned the lakers all year.
whooperman::If, If , If.  Maybe if your team was actually good you wouldn't be battling with terrible teams for a chance to get swept first round.
VicksBestDawg::My team? I despise the Lakers and their biased coverage and ref help, but I'm realistic.
whooperman::I love how GK said after the game, "I hate helping the Lakers."  Thank you for being right there with all the fans in this great city.  I love this guy.
16Lakers18::Utah's next three games: New orleans, Golden State, OKC Lakers next three games: Memphis, Clippers, New Orleans  If lakers can go 2-1 and utah goes 1-2.  Lets hope Houston, San Antonio start resting players.  Lakers have a great shot at making the playoffs.
charlie hustle bets the over::That's a big if.  Jazz definitely have a better chance at going 2-1.
whooperman::You would think $100 million would buy more, but no.
leon sandcastles69::if if if if is all laker fans ever say...
diehardnr1::let us know how that all works out for ya...I will be too busy watching the Nuggets secure the 3 to take the time to look...
diehardnr1::Remember when we were loved by the Laker Nation?
jaer04::Now everybody hates only u Jack
diehardnr1::I am nourished by your tears of fear...
VicksBestDawg::Tomorrow is probably the defining game of the Lakers season. Backs against the wall, tough opponent, home court. They win this one FAIRLY and I'm done trolling them this year.
jaer04::What Whooperman your an idiot the Lakers could beat the spurs but the Heat will be the 2013 NBA FINALS CHAMPS for 2 years in a row and then the NBA FINALS Heat champ streak will last at least 5 years then LeBron will retire
diehardnr1::so...you are a Cavs fan and a OKC fan and a  Heat fan?  Just sound like a typical two-faced Lebron slurper to me...What a poser...
whooperman::How is the lakers defining game against a team thats not even in the top 3, on your home court!?  That is sad.
Ho Jay::I think they win in. Im confident the lakers make the playoffs and they will go all the way
diehardnr1::well...I went with "cute" instead of stupid...but who am I to argue...lol
VicksBestDawg::That's just stupid. They don't have the talent or depth to beat the top 4 West teams (or the Heat) in a 7 game series.
diehardnr1::so what will you do if they lose or win with the refs help?
whooperman::No way lakers can even come close to knocking off spurs, the talent gap is huge.  They get all excited when they beat portland... what an achievement.
diehardnr1::I actually almost started rooting for them....until I realized that even if they get in and knock off Spurs, that the Nuggets would still play the 2 seed in 2nd round.  So immediately went back to hating them...lol  Isn't Ho Jay cute thinking the LaLas are going to win it all? lmao  I thought the KoolAid ran out months ago...
VicksBestDawg::Troll like I've never trolled before.
doof54::Congratulations Nuggets. Impressive win.   But if you so much as blink, the Grizz are taking that 3 seed.
joelb29::Check yourself idiot.  The Nuggets have been a solid team for the last 10 years.
jaer04::DUDE ur a fan of the NUGGETS then your a idiot
whooperman::We have tie breaker, you better not lose any more games...
leon sandcastles69::lmao riiight, y'all ain't taking shizz
diehardnr1::eyes wide open...
JaValeMcGee1934::nice win Nuggets.....The Lakers will have wished they would of not made the playoffs after what they will do in 2013
JaValeMcGee1934::my comments being censored now?
JaValeMcGee1934::Anyone here from yesterday day?
whooperman::Just got to work haha.
diehardnr1::im baaaack...
diehardnr1::is that your new battle cry for the Fake show?  Poser
jaer04::cough cough gay
diehardnr1::GG Jazz...even though I always say that after a game, its kinda insincere this time.... One could see the defeat in the Jazz players eyes during the first Quarter.  Maybe they are buying into the conspiracy theory and just figure it does not matter what they do....baffling...hope you guys can get it together and win out...you will almost HAVE to.  GREAT game Nuggets!  forced your game in their house...not an easy task normally.  Another good TEAM W without Ty.  Speaking of... Fournier proved to the doubters that he is for real this game...something I have known since seeing him play in Europe.  Better defender than Dre or Ty and his offense is improving minute by minute.  Only worries are JaVales head, Gallos maddening inconsistency, and Iggy thinking hes a jump shooter...  Oh well, they make up for it in other areas.  Will MEM ever lose??  GO NUGGETS!!!
floridavandyfan1::We will beat Memphis for you!!! GO LAKERS!!
diehardnr1::you can bet I will not be on the Lakers board begging for the help though...
Lakers81___::Thank u Denver!
whooperman::GFYS, we spanked you 3 times this year no need to thank us.
Ho Jay::I don't understand ur logic given that y'all need that 3 and Utah need the 8..which they lost to the Lakers
diehardnr1::subtlety is lost on you isn't it...the way the game was PLAYED showed DEN wants the 3 WAY more than UTA wants the 8.  Besides....Stern is going to ensure you guys get in...so please stop pretending the Lakers are deserving of a playoff spot and accept the gift...
Ho Jay::i care. and it's as much about the 8th spot as it is the 3rd
diehardnr1::besides...did you see this game?  It was DEFINITELY all about the 3...
diehardnr1::not on this board...lol
diehardnr1::worry about your schedule instead...no one cares here...this game was about the 3 seed...not the 8
floridavandyfan1::THANK YOU DENVER!!!!  -this lakers fan!!
Ho Jay::F the nuggets
diehardnr1::dam.n! you are starting to grow on me...lol
Ho Jay::I thought really hard for tht one
diehardnr1::clever response
diehardnr1::F  the Lakers -This Nuggets fan
lakers2013champsz GBE 300 .bangbang.::flopie meeks
NASH_10::Thanks, Denver! Glad to see there's at least one team who isn't tanking to avoid facing the Lakeshow @ #8 (ie Spurs and OKC)
cmanjones1515::Trust me nobody and i mean NOBODY is scared of the Lakers this year. I would prefer to play them in the first round just so we could have a nice easy 4 game sweep.
whooperman::Avoid facing the fake show?  Hahahaha you LA people are funny, must be that thick smog choking your sense of reality
Ho Jay::Playoffs is a brand new season. Just ask the spurs. they know
cscobra::no one is afraid of Lakers, 4 game sweep going at the hands of the Spurs.  Series will not even be close.  LA has shown they can not beat the top teams in the West all season
diehardnr1::on an even court I agree....Crawford and company should worry the Spurs just a little though...
diehardnr1::DEN afraid of no team....especially the Fake Show
