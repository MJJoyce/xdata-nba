Anton::Now I see the genius of that Boston trade...KG and Pierce are washed up...Celtics get some picks for two old scrubs...that is genius.
GoHorns::I know that Paul George is playing out of his mind good this year... but I honestly think the biggest X-factor for the Pacers hot start is Lance Stevenson's elevated play... wish hbo would do one of those sappy  documentaries on Bird's and Stevenson's mentor-player relationship, I'd watch that...
Jacko::Should be a good game at Brooklyn!  I think the Nets are still trying to put it all together, but I imagine they will come out and go after the Pacers tonight!  Should come down to whose better in the 4th...
two-seamer::The Nets are so overrated!  Probably won't even win 40 games!
Randy H::Even as good as the Pacers are playing so far, they are not getting the respect from sportscasters that they deserve. Its always about Lebron and that's getting old!
jammin400::Lance Stephenson would be a great player if he could make a free throw.  No guard should shoot below 50% free throws; that's just terrible.
I State Facts And You Get Mad::KG looks finished and the season just started, no way does he make it thru the whole season where he can play well in the playoffs
Kyle::What is with Deron Williams' minutes this season?
Hugh Jashole::You knew it was going to take the Nets and J.Kidd half a season to figure things out with this huge roster.  There's just no flow or chemistry out there yet.  It's like they are just winging it on offense and the bench guys look better than the starters so far this year.
