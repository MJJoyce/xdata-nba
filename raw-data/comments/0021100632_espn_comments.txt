pacific2012::By far the worst basketball I have seen since middle school.  The Bobcats looked lazy, which is unreal since they get paid a bunch of money to play Basketball!!!  DJ Augustin lost all the respect I had for him.  Why would a NBA player yell at a fan who said " Good D" to a Rockets player (Dragic).  .   After this fan said Good D to Dragic, Augustin turned to the fan and yelled "Good D $@%!$!"  The comment was completely uncalled for and this anecdote is NOT out of context.  There was nothing else said between the fan and Augustin.  Augustin needs to mature and it is my guess that he does not realize children look up to him as a role model.  Too bad this has become a normality with today's NBA.  I beg Augustin and other players to be the better men and see that these type of words can seriously impact our young people.
prezh601::Micheal Jordan needs to call up Mike Dantoni right now and make t he hire.. HE may not get them into any playoffs but he will find the  right players to fit his system to score points and make them competitive.. HE should be hired tomorrow.. Get old man river off the bench and tell him to be a sportscaster!!Mike hire DanToni .. He is not hte best coach but his system at least open the team up..
cuckercrazy::howard asking for nash if he's gonna stay... could be lethal.. rest of the league better watch out for orlando http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
Sambo8964::Well this Rockets fan from Eastern North Carolina is just glad to see the Rockets win again. This Bobcats fan wishes the Bobcats well for the future, but does not trust Michael Jordan as an owner.
streetgrizz::Stay the course bobcats. Stay the course.
HollaIfYaHEMI::I guess the Rockets have to start thinking playoffs...I wonder when their fans will get on board.
disguyman::michael jordan killed the bobcats, tell him his experiment is over.  now go manage a baseball team
3rdCoastTexan::great performance rockets...3rd quarter was phenomenal
FunnyTacos934::rout'em rockets!!
J-SMOOVE2033::Magic get: Luis Scola, Kevin Martin, Samuel Dalembert, Goran Dragic, draft picks  Rockets get: Dwight Howard, Hedo Turkoglu
bmisaqi09::No way thats going to happen. Who'll be the Rockets starting and reserve point guard for the next three weeks?  I say we keep Dragic and draft picks, and instead send Budinger
3rdCoastTexan::just so Dwight can leave for nothing?!? no thanks...sign him first then we'll talk

YaoFTW::WHITES WILL NEVER RUN THE NBA...    YOU RACIST WHITES, ASIANS, LATINOS.... BETTER NOT TRY THAT RACISM CRAP IN THE NBA   WE WANT TO KEEP THE NBA, AND NFL ALL BLACK, YOU THINK WHAT I SAID IS RACIST, CHECK OUT HOW BLACK HOCKEY PLAYERS, BLACK MMA FIGHTERS, AND BLACK AMATUER DRIVERS GET TREATED BADLY BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE( dont come at me with racism sympathy card) --------------------------------------------------------------------  SO BECAUSE IF A BLACK GUY HAVE AN IQ ON PAR WITH AN ASIAN AND HIGHER, BUT THE ASIAN GETS INTO HARVARD AND HE DOESNT( does that mean Harvard is racist againist Blacks).   NHL, NASCAR, AND GOLF ARE WAY MORE RACIST THAT THE NBA...( just look at the rosters of each sports and compare)
CTthunder860::hockey fans are canadian and czech republic and nascar is certified southern red neck dont compare that to the rest of AMERICA u uneducated dumb $@%! get a life
