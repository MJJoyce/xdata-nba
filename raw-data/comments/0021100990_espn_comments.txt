Raidersyeahthatsright::And thus begins the final chapter to the Spurs 2010 Championship.......
gundy6603::Congrats CW on an awesome game--Go Flyers!
OriginalKiteMike::Kawhi Leonard !!! A rookie this year in the NBA - but ALSO, a "starter" for the Spurs !!  Notice Spurs coaching rested him this last reg season game ?? Danny Green played very few minutes too - ALSO a Spurs starter, but was dressed for the game.  Makes one think huh ? Wow ! Do Spurs know how to pick em or what ? Check these videos out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8FKTYuKUuI&amp;feature=related  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA1GYjD1yHo&amp;feature=relmfu
tdawg44446::Can the Blazers have him back now? We need him :(
Codeine Jones::Spurs &gt; OKC, Heat, Bulls, etc
Road dog Red::Mills was a heck of a pickup.. is everyone else in the NBA blind...who is the Bobcats GM...theres a guys who should be fired...oh its Michael Jordan...figures
bscott07::just my funny/strange thoughts. NO slap at Golden State here...just the media. I noticed 4 times (at least) they praised Golden State for not tanking and even talked to Mark Jackson about it between the 3 and 4th quarters. For the love of Naismith...starting 5 rookies and only dressing 7...somebody help me with the definition of tanking...I MUST be missing something.  Also, shame on you ESPN...50 in a row for 13 seasons...new record beating out the precious Lakers for consecutive 50 win seasons and NO mention of this on the front page or even in the article?  Gotta love the 50 wins for 13 straight seasons! Boring ol' Spurs...all they ever do is win. Winning is boring...right? Spurs fans, enjoy what we have and what we have seen. The culture, consistency, and chemistry that RC, Pop, and FO have established is amazing. Too bad the mass media can't latch on to what true beauty really is.
easlerbush::"Now that it's over, you've got to look at it that way," Golden State coach Mark Jackson said. "But in the middle of it we were trying to win. BS Jackson why lie when its so obvious what you are doing. It makes you sound so stupid. We all know what you are doing so just come out and say it. Here i will help you "we are tanking a$$ so we can STEAL the pick promised to Utah". Now if you said that people might not think you are such a joke.
OriginalKiteMike::Warriors also got the Spurs first round pick in the trade with Richard Jefferson.  So, looks like they will get 2 picks now right?
HateBrass::Didn't the overrated Mark Jackson who played four years in college and didn't play for a national title GUARANTEE a playoff berth this year? Didn't Jackson, who played for 12 teams in 17 years without winning a title GUARANTEE a playoff berth this year? Didn't Jackson, who talked a great game on television, make it sound like he was going to teach folks how to coach?  NOT SO EASY HUH?  He came to the NBA with no prior coaching experience yet since folks liked him, said he would be the perfect coach.  Yeah, 23-43 shows how good he is.  I remember back in 2000 when Isiah Thomas, who also had no prior coaching experience, took over Larry Bird's team that had just reached the NBA Finals.  But Thomas didn't inherit the same players Bird had.  Thomas didn't get four former all stars (Smits, Mullins, Jackson and Davis), instead, got three high schoolers (Bender, O'Neal and Harrington) who rarely played in the NBA.  All Thomas did was develop the young talent the Pacers had, finished .500 that first year and made the playoffs.  In those three years in Indiana, Thomas built that young talent into a competitive team, made the playoffs all three years with winning records and they got better each year.  When he was fired in 2003 despite a 48-34 record, Rick Carlisle came in and said he was so surprised how well Thomas had developed the young talent that Carlisle would win 61 games with that year.  All I'm saying is likable guys like Jackson will get passes from folks and say he was put in a tough sitaution and haters of Thomas will say he couldn't coach when he worked miracles knowing basktball and how to improve the talent on the court.
GameBlouses83::I don't see how not winning as a player has anything to do with his coaching merit. MJ, the greatest player ever, is now owner to the worst team in the nba. Also, the guy is third all-time in assists, and he was a fat back then too. Meaning, he's a smart guy who excelled through is court knowledge more than his athletic abilities.   Mark did guarantee a playoff birth, I'll give you that. But he did say that thinking Steph was going to be healthy, with Monte still on the team, and before the team was in tank-mode. No one hated on Thomas when he got hired by NY because you're right, he did well in Indiana. But people started the hate when he helped in destroying the the Knicks-- I think you left that out of the argument. Jackson is one season in, and Thomas has a full body of work to hate/or not. Let's not go Skip Bayless and make irrelevant arguments about a guy you have a crush on.
thmswsullivan::This win is a testament to the Spurs as an organization. Before the season started I was concerned that they would not be able to achieve 50 wins in a shortened season. However, as the season progressed Pop was able to squeeze the potential out of every player on the roster. It is no surprise that this streak of (50+ wins) started after they won their first title. When its all said and done POP will be ranked among the top 3 NBA coaches of all-time. As for Tim Duncan. His legacy is intake as the best power forward of all-time. Congrats to the Spurs. Now it is time to finish what you started and win a 5th title for the franchise.
bjknight87::Golden State should be fined for that starting 5.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::To all the Spurs fans....the Spurs/jazz room is now available!
OriginalKiteMike::Never mind. I found it. See you there - hopefully without the stinking anti-Spurs trolls.
OriginalKiteMike::Tells us where please? New here.
BOBBO409::Do any of these idiots on ESPN do their homework before they start spewin' this nonsense? "One of the oldest rosters in the league"? We arent even in the top 5, barely in the top 10...The other day, on SC, they said Timmy was 37 (actually was 35 at the time), said manu was late 30's, (actually 34) and the worst of all of them said TP was in his 30's (dude is only 29)...How do they expect the public to be informed when they cant even spit out the right info?
OriginalKiteMike::Yeah - "the same old Spurs that consistently win for the past 13 years".  *With a few / bunches of extra young players learning from the (added) veterans.  Every business should be run like that.  Except maybe the government .... We're going to need some new blood in there - preferably some honest ones on BOTH side of the fence.
JD4REAL::^ so true. I think its because people refer to the Spurs as the 'same old Spurs' - the same old Spurs that consistently win for the past 13 years. yeah but they are hardly have one of the oldest rosters. I think the Mavs, Heat, and Celtics are top 3 last time I checked.
Ishmael203::patty mills!!
eddietheaggie2010::The Spurs.  The SPURS.  THE SPURS!
bmadger::These guys are still talking about the "age" of the spurs...c'mon.  This is not the same team
Tim Duncan Professional::We are ready!
VCLeaper15::Against all odds...age and a shortened season the Spurs post another 50 win season
playinaround2::Aw fer Chrissakes, the Spurs do NOT have "one of the oldest rosters" in the NBA. they average a bit over 27, even after bringing in Jackson and Diaw - about the NBA average. ESPN really takes this ignoring the Spurs thing seriously, don't they? But the cracks are forming. Lots of their TV analysts are realizing that ignoring the Spurs will make them look foolish this year and are starting to hedge their bets.
SB47-Locker10::FINAL VERDICT !!!!! WARRIORS ARE DEFINITELY GARBAGE!! DA ABSOLUTE TRUTH!! MILLS BURIES SHERA WARRIORS!!
chitownbullsinseven::I’ve been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 3 months straight now following this system. I found this system by Google searching the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for  anyone that is looking for a system that actually works and is tired of not winning your bets
cknowles87::Jeremy Tyler dunks all over Charles Jenkins? They're on the same team!
OriginalKiteMike::Yep - 'back ups' to the BENCH .... but hey - The sportscasters are tired too. They don't run those teams like Spurs do. Rested and ready for anything !
daboafadem::I saw that too.  The Spurs had so many D-league guys out there, the announcers couldn't keep it straight.  LOL
Hollerationatory::The third quarter of the 2012 Spurs-Lakers (#3) reg. season game was easily one of the most thorough dismantlings I've ever seen across 12 minutes in 20 years as a fan of this sport. It was like the Spurs were Jedi Knights who had pre-cognition before every move the storm trooper Lakers made.
sport medic::The Lakers find out Meta World Peace is a poor substitute for  midichlorians.
Hollerationatory::http://espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=320420024&amp;period=3  12-18 shooting in that quarter
daboafadem::100% true.  The Spurs opened the door for any team to abuse LA in the playoffs.  Watching the Lakers defend the pick and roll is like watching Japan trying to defend itself from a Tsunami.  The waves just keep on crashing...
supafreshballer::PATTY MILLS!!!
Raidersyeahthatsright::I don't see them keeping Joseph on the playoff rsoter, MIlls will definitely be there, though.
OriginalKiteMike::Yes !! Mills looks GREAT and I hope he stays with Spurs for a long time - like even after Tony retires. We have several Outback Steakhouses here and he likes the fried onion things. Hope he stays healthy all through the playoffs, gets some good minutes there and does well in the Olympics this summer.  That's one FAST and smart player ! (who can hit the 3 ball anytime he wants to and has a great short range shot and .... can take it to the basket at will)
Barrybran::I'm an Aussie NBA fan and I don't believe anyone will overpay him on the back of two good games. He's a good player but still hasn't even established himself as a bench player let alone warranting someone overpaying him.
daboafadem::I'll be happy if he comes back to SA next year.
slam_dunk_on_u::Too bad he is as good as gone after this season the spurts can not afford him because he is going to find a team who is going to overpay him
15steele15::This dude has been talking about crap for the longest and is ALWAYS wrong......We know you hate the Spurs but just give it up and stick with your garbage $@% Celts, see how far they go
polocash::if he doesn't make the playoff team no one will over pay him
daboafadem::Yes he will.  He is the 12th man.  They'll leave out James Anderson. Duh....
slam_dunk_on_u::he won't be even make your playoff roster....LOL
daboafadem::It's too bad there is no way the Spurs will meet the Lakers this year.  The Lakers will never reach the WCF.  I would have loved to see the Spurs sweep them by an average margin of 25 points per game.
slam_dunk_on_u::just like the first game?
Raidersyeahthatsright::You mean when he shot 9-26? That was inspired? OKC choked, that's it.
slam_dunk_on_u::Words marked
daboafadem::If George Karl watches 5 good tapes of Lakers getting destroyed defending the pick &amp; roll and runs it non-stop, the Nuggets will push that series to 7 or steal it in 6.  Mark my words.
daboafadem::Except that The Thunder choked and blew a 17 point lead because they stopped running pick &amp; roll and went to KD-RW jacking up shots.  Spurs won't do that.  The Lakers are one of the worst pick &amp; roll defending teams I've ever seen make the playoffs.  And worse news yet, their coach has no clue how to stop it.
Hollerationatory::Kobe just wasn't inspired enough....THAT's IT!  Maybe when he gets some experience under his belt he'll learn that every game counts.
slam_dunk_on_u::You saw what happend to the Thunder with an inspired Kobe Bryant I expect no different aganst the Nuggets or the spurts or whoever.
daboafadem::No, more like the last 2, especially the one with Kobe and the Lakers lost by 25.
Hollerationatory::I like your ears.
Hollerationatory::Like I said before, Lakers better hope that one doesn't happen because there will be blood.
Spurs2012champs told u::Spurs take out $@%! in 4 then we shut the world upand take the grizz in 5
Raidersyeahthatsright::When Spurs win slamdunkfag will be nowhere to be seen, just like all season. Troll thy name is slam-dunk-on-u!
slam_dunk_on_u::Anyways Goodnight....I win the argument...like always
daboafadem::Last word always wins.  Good luck to that team of yours.  They're gonna need it!
slam_dunk_on_u::Any rebuttals daboafadem?
slam_dunk_on_u::So the spurts core will have like 5 days off before the first playoff game right?  If they lose Game 1 I see excuses this type of excuses:  1. Noon Game 2. Playing Rusty. 3. Partied too much the night before. 4. Insert your excuse here__________
daboafadem::Lakers will probably lose game 1 against Denver.    Likely excuses for their game 1 loss.  1.  The officials only gave LAL a 45-8 advantage at the FT line, it isn't fair, boo-hoo. 2.  Kobe still shaking off rust, working himself back into the offense. 3.  Bynum was ejected for a cheap shot on Mike Brown. 4.  Pull excuse out of your choice:  Vachina/Wrecktum
slam_dunk_on_u::Injury Prone....I wouldn't be surprised if it happens again this year in the first round more fuel to your excuses after their demise
mccoy3181::This d ouche bag is a Faker fan
bmadger::yeah, year after year...except those 4 years when they won the title, right? BTW, what team do you support?  Ya know, so we can tear down your excuses
slam_dunk_on_u::Don't Look....pray son
daboafadem::Except...well, let me look....oh yes, the Spurs are in fact healthy right now.  So I'll take my chances on it staying that way.
slam_dunk_on_u::I'm not wishing I just said I wouldnt be surprised after seeing it year after yaer and spurt fans making excuses for it after every playoff exit
daboafadem::If someone gets hurt, oh well.  Now you're the one wishing.  Wishing for an injury because you know that sad LA squad without PJ as coach will never win another title.  I should expect as much.  Your team had 3 guys ejected for dirty play last year and you still worship them all.
slam_dunk_on_u::Letme remind you Rudy Gay didnt play either due to injury that cancels out your lame "injury" excuse
daboafadem::I genuinely believe SA will put Memphis through a meat grinder if they meet this year.  Payback is a $@%!$.
Louie2130::that is your father-in-laws house....you don't had one
daboafadem::Where is an excuse?  Where?  Point it out!  You are such a tool.  You referred to the Spurs reaching the WCF as choking.  You referred to them knocking off a 2 seed as a 7 as a choke, when most pundits call that an upset.  Since when is reaching the playoffs as a 7 seed a "great regular season" as you put it?  GTFOH.  Oh heaven forbid I admitted they lost to a better team last year!  What an excuse!  LEARN ENGLISH YOU CHILD.
slam_dunk_on_u::And here we go:  The "Injury" excuse!  Might as well get rid of him since he is a liability come playoff time...  Wow spurt fans are a piece of work!
daboafadem::Your opinions don't.  Truth is based on facts of which you have presented very little.
daboafadem::You don't even have your history right.   2008 Ginobili injured, Spurs limp into WCF as a 3 seed.  Hardly a choke for a defending champion. 2009 Ginobili injured again, Spurs enter playoffs as a 3 seed, lose to Dallas 1st round 2010 Spurs jettison long timers Bowen and Kurt Thomas, enter playoffs as 7 seed, reach semis, not a choke 2011 Spurs get best record in West, but enter playoffs on a 4-8 slump, Duncan and Ginobili both limited by injuries, lose to the best #8 seed in history
slam_dunk_on_u::Thuth hurts doesnt it?
daboafadem::This from a guy who was only accurate on 8.69% of his Spurs picks this year.  Clearly, you know basketball.  LOL
slam_dunk_on_u::AND YOU SAY THEY ARE DIFFERENT THIS YEAR?  YES THEY ARE...THEY ARE A YEAR OLDER
slam_dunk_on_u::PLAYOFF CHOKERS
slam_dunk_on_u::Last 3 or 4 years:  Spurts = Great Regular season Team
tjthursday511::HAHAHAHAHAHAH
daboafadem::They may or may not reach the finals.  But....no team played better down the stretch this year, and no team presents the plethora of matchup problems the Spurs do.  So, I have no issue believing in this year's team.
slam_dunk_on_u::i mso sure the spurts will dissapoint a lot of spurt fans this year again im willing to bet my house
daboafadem::Good for you.  I'm sure your parents will be thrilled when your poor judgement cost them the place you all live in.
slam_dunk_on_u::I bet my house on it
daboafadem::You invest your life savings on that prediction!
slam_dunk_on_u::spurts are choking again...just watch
daboafadem::How many games will it take for Denver to eliminate LAL?  And how many games will Bynum be suspended as a result of another playoff, flame-out temper tantrum?
slam_dunk_on_u::Wishful thinking spurt fans
daboafadem::Denver is 50 times more likely to beat LA than the Salt Lake City Jizzz to upend the Spurs.
slam_dunk_on_u::i meant losing to denver
daboafadem::Check the schedule.  21-2 is a fact.  That is what they did to end the year.  Nothing wishful about it.
daboafadem::Spurs are on a tear.  21-2 finish to the season.  And they have so many weapons.
tjthursday511::You've done your research. I like that. I trust your judgement. Go nuggets (in this series). GO SPURS (overall). HA!
daboafadem::I think the Lakers are ripe for an implosion.  Bench sucks, Barnes gimpy, MWP out, Bynum doesn't want to play with his team mates, Kobe doesn't trust anyone even though he is shooting his worst % in more than 10 years.  Denver is young, athletic, and deep.  They only need 1 little road win to pull it off.
tjthursday511::You're right. However, the 2 big men for the Nuggets (McGee and Koufos) are going to have to play the best defense of their lives. They won't have to do too much at the offensive end because of Lawson and Affalo, which is the good news.
tjthursday511::Ya know what? SCREW IT. Denver in 6. Boom.
daboafadem::No MWP means Lakers are missing their best wing defender.  And the Lakers bench was already paper thin. I really see Denver giving them all they can handle.
tjthursday511::I HATE the Lakers, but they'll beat Denver. But lose to the Thunder.
daboafadem::I think LA should be favored, but that series is not automatic.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Good night Spurs Nation! Goooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!! Spurs!!!!! Goooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!
rockodmc::Spurs lose to Memphis .....Watch
tjthursday511::Spurs win.
polocash::I know what you mean,, I think Grizz could lose to LA
slam_dunk_on_u::2 year in a row where the spurts as number one seed is ousted by memphis the lower seed ...but spurt fans hope they get past the firts round
tjthursday511::Bro, I'll be the first to say that ignorance is NOT bliss. You have no idea what you're talking about. For one, you're misspelling the team name = loss of credibility on your part. 2) you actually think the Lakers will win the west = stupidity. If the Spurs don't (which they will), the Thunder will beat the Lakers in the 2nd round. 3) Your name? You probably couldn't dunk over Muggsy Bogues on a 7ft goal with a springboard.
daboafadem::Yup, just like how you went 2-21 in your last 23 picks against SA
tjthursday511::CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
tjthursday511::Spurs-Griz rematch in the second round. Spurs DESTROY them for what happened last year. Manu scores infinite points to prove it was his fault for what happened.
tjthursday511::Griz-Clips is a toss-up for me. They're both good teams. I'd just LOVE to see Spurs/Griz all over again.
polocash::I predict we don't see Grizz in rd 2.. a hunch, but wouldn't bet it.. at least I am honest..
tjthursday511::When I say destroy, I don't mean they win in 4... I mean, the 4 games they win, they win BIG. I'd say Spurs in 6 overall though. However, Manu still scores infinite points.
wrduardo::Nah, as a Spurs fan there will be no destroying of the Grizz...it will be a 6 or 7 game series as they are the second best team in the West behind the Spurs
rockodmc::Spurs Lose 2nd round ....Thunder takes West....Heat gets 1st with trio
polocash::Grizz won last year as they came into playoffs healthier and hotter than Spurs.. not the case this year.. if they win this year,  I will respect them more
tjthursday511::without ron artest, Lakers go nowhere. He's not an amazing player. But he sure does take a lot of pressure off kobe.
slam_dunk_on_u::spurt fans think they are the ones coming out west LMAO
pmanning232::Yeah, because what would make you think that? Finishing first in the west certainly wouldn't.  I don't really think it's too ridiculous to think the Spurs could win WC championship.  Btw, learn to spell.  S-p-u-r-s.... Spurs
tjthursday511::and Shaq, who got EVERY pick for both conferences right before the season even started. I'd listen to what he has to say. PS: he says Spurs win it all.
polocash::So does Barkley, and several other professionals who know a little about the game
rockodmc::spurs lose to memphis....and you know it
slam_dunk_on_u::The Grizzlies have their playoff number...regular season is meaningless
polocash::after I win lotto and record a #1 hit
wrduardo::And baby Jesus returns to us on a flying dragon with a bazooka to blast away injustice...
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::lmfao
wrduardo::Holy cow...does sports media/ESPN know no bounds of Spurs hate?  On the night when the Spurs won their 50th game for the 14th time in as many seasons setting the NBA record, they are talking more about the Warriors...THE WARRIORS!!!!
wrduardo::even better...and it really is funny to see a Lakers fan bashing on the Spurs...don't really get why they need to hate so much on other teams...the Spurs don't hate on other teams because they know how to win with class : /
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Thank you sir!
polocash::Not caring = complete ignoring..  talking about any team good or bad = caring
tjthursday511::15th season in a row.
tjthursday511::...unless Charles, shaq, and kenny were wrong.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::They feel bad for them.
slam_dunk_on_u::spurts are boring nobody cares about them
daboafadem::it's boring to opponents when their team loses to SA all the time
pmanning232::Nobody can care about us all the way to our fifth championship.  Dude are you reading sports columns from five years ago?  Do you also think the Spurs are the oldest team in the NBA?  Try 13th oldest team.  Come with a better argument then, "They're boring."  If you'd watched any Spurs basketball this year, you'd realize that's not true.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::And why are you on here then?  Because your fakers suck? Lmfao
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::How many winning streaks of ten plus games did the fakers have this season? Hmmm.....lmfao
slam_dunk_on_u::Lakers fans like 16-game winning streaks in the playoffs where the games actually matter
daboafadem::Lakers have never won 16 games in a row in the playoffs.  Are you high?
truetopia::Dude we already know you're going to disappear a few games into the playoffs
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Its doesn't matter anymore your fakers are one and done with a dumb coach!
Hollerationatory::We're all on the same page that the Spurs are the best team in basketball, right? I'm not sure why there's so much strife and BS negativity.
OriginalKiteMike::WHY So much negativity ? I we all ignore that - it will go away to some other board to try to get a rise outta anyone he can - just cause he has no life.  That's what he does for fun.  Imagine that .... he's sitting there pecking the keys with a straight jacket on with one hand sticking out, drooling cause his nurse put a lock down on his porn sites.  Just love the NBA for what it is - or do something else, eh?   BTW - If the NBA didn't have the good example of the Spurs organization, it woud lack class and might as well be called "Gorilla Golf".  (Crude and unattractive)
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Salami dunk on your face....I've had the most laughs this season....especially when your predictions were a FAIL about the Spurs losing to the elite teams.....check mate! Lmfao
polocash::cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils. - I'm off this board. I'll be around various ESPN boardsat times during the playoffs. Let's hope someone,ANYONE beats the Spurs during the plaoffs. I'd rather get a dementors kiss or suffer 20 hours worth of the Cruciatus Curse than see the Spurs win it all. I hope for Jazz in 4, Goodnight all.  You should know what it's like!! You have experienced all of the above!
polocash::To keep from getting a sunburn..
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::He went to go bury himself in the sand...like a scorpion!
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Salami dunk on your face coming in here....hating on the Spurs....I guess because his fakers are turrible!  Lmfao
bmadger::Every year it's the same...there's always some d-bag like slam_dunk that comes trolling with pointless and idiotic comments.  Probably the highlight of his day though...so I guess that's something for you, huh slam_punk?
polocash::yes it is,,
polocash::Barkley's only 1st round upset pick.. Denver over LA.
slam_dunk_on_u::is not going to be an easy serie for the spurts idiot!
slam_dunk_on_u::Barkley likes to jinx teams didnt you know that? he pick the spurts to win so that means the opposite is going to occur
truetopia::and that knucklehead said the jazz spurs series would be a good 1..haha negro please
slam_dunk_on_u::you are going to eat your words come playoff time idiot!  I'm going to be the last one to have the last laugh
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Seems like you're mad kid....go eat your malt o meal and go to sleep.
WeAreTheMIB::Lakers suck...one and done...
lll__::<i>The Warriors, decimated by injuries, were also short-handed and became the first NBA team in modern history to start five rookies in one game.</i>  how embarrassing.
polocash::I could start 5 kids,,, but who played the most minutes???
polocash::We had 2 D league players playing..
truetopia::ha ha I know right! these clueless trolls are ruining a good Spurs board
truetopia::Who cares?? And that was our end of the bench players, not our second string!!
slam_dunk_on_u::If their bench is so good like they say they are they should have beaten the Warriors by triple digits LOL
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Elaborate the fakers loss tonight!
slam_dunk_on_u::Thats what im trying to explain to these fools
polocash::Hey Whitey  At least we know your not 2 faced... if you were, you would definitely where the other 1
badboyscruffy::From Australia, with love.
caseygreer2::The Warrior started 5 Rookies?!?! They really wanted the Jazz pick didn't they? That's sad. Warriors fans, you deserve better.
KennyChavezDuran::Thats all the Warriors have.  Beidrins doesnt deserve to start another game for the Warriors, neither does Dorell Wright
jtmaese::Wow Fakers lose last game of the season to a team not even seeded just cause they sat $@%! bryant thats pathetic.
tjthursday511::In all fairness, gasol, bynum, world peace, &amp; bryant didn't play. BUT STILL, spurs bench is beating up teams with d-league players and other players who average 10 or few minutes per game.
WeAreTheMIB::So, do you think Metta World Blumpkin will be back before the Lakers are eliminated? ;-)
truetopia::No
slam_dunk_on_u::the spurts scrubs would have lost tonight if not by GS tanking the game to retain their draft pick
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::And what's your point idiot?
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::And the Spurs say out their big three and still won......:-) !
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::A wIn iS a wIn!
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Its not the Spurs fault they started their rookies.
slam_dunk_on_u::very close game for playing agaisnt the GS rookies LOL
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::When phil jackson retired...the faker dynasty died...along with salami dunk on his face!
WeAreTheMIB::NO PJ, NO RING!
slam_dunk_on_u::You like my attention son?
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::The truth? All your useless predictions have gone to waste kid....keep hating boy!
slam_dunk_on_u::I only speak the truth son
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Actually we all puke when you come in here!
polocash::He only left because he saw the writing on the wall... When did he ever coach a 5th seed or worse or non contender to a championship???
WeAreTheMIB::The Mavs lost to the #8 seed Warriors in 2007...SFW?  That's the PAST...just like the Lakers...heh heh...
JD4REAL::I like how everybody brings up last year. 1 vs 8. Anybody with basketball knowledge knows the top 8 or 10 teams in the western conference were so close that anybody could have beat anybody last year. Hell the Grizzlies took the Thunder to 7 games in the 2nd round. Spurs would have lost even if Ginobli didnt break his arm...just saying. The west has been so competitive in the past 10 years, playoff seeding is irrelevant. They just want to make it to the playoffs!
OriginalKiteMike::I can't wait to see our Spurs with a few days off between games !! Wow ! This is going to be FUN !!!
polocash::Started 0-5 on road..  22-6 since
Chris31708::The Spurs actually started playing worse towards the end of the regular season last year, this year they have stayed consistent, and are playing better on the road now than they were earlier in the season.
jtmaese::true, and are just getting better.
jtmaese::best 4 or coach!
truetopia::Two nice young players.. Can't wait to see Leonard just keep on growing!
polocash::starting to look like Mills... I'd like to see Splitter with a presesaon under his belt...
truetopia::Yeah I got it lol But a question arose, and to fellow spurs fans I pose:  who do u think is our fourth best player??  Leonard, Jackson, etc
polocash::I said 4 on bench... Parker, Manu, Pop, Duncan
truetopia::u sure weren't referring RJ, were u?  Lol But a thought....who is our fourth best player?
polocash::Coach is part of best 4 on bench!
WeAreTheMIB::WERD, polocash...had the Spurs starters played these last two games, it would've been two 30-point blowouts.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::And the bench still scored over 100....o yea!
polocash::Jazz are not last years Grizz.. Spurs beat #9 (Suns who were trying for winning record) without their best 4 on the bench..
WeAreTheMIB::Last year, the Spurs were banged up and limped into the playoffs.  This year, they are healthy and peaking at the right time, and are also a much deeper team.  They're going to wear out their opponents.
truetopia::Don't lose with Manu..he changes everything
truetopia::Memphis bids both were great... But Manu changes pace and dynamics of game on both ends.. And also, to ur point, spurs bigs are better now with Splitter finally getting real mins
JD4REAL::idk, Manu is great. But Z Randolph last year was amazing. If it wasnt for Gary Neal, Spurs would have lost in 5 games. Spurs bench is deeper this year. Being #1 vs #8 was hardly noticeable in regards to talent/playoff expectations.
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::I'm off this board. I'll be around various ESPN boardsat times during the playoffs. Let's hope someone,ANYONE beats the Spurs during the plaoffs. I'd rather get a dementors kiss or suffer 20 hours worth of the Cruciatus Curse than see the Spurs win it all. I hope for Jazz in 4, Goodnight all.
OriginalKiteMike::WHY So much negativity ? I we all ignore that - it will go away to some other board to try to get a rise outta anyone he can - just cause he has no life.  That's what he does for fun.  Imagine that .... he's sitting there pecking the keys with a straight jacket on with one hand sticking out, drooling cause his nurse put a lock down on his porn sites.  Just love the NBA for what it is - or do something else, eh?   BTW - If the NBA didn't have the good example of the Spurs organization, it would lack class and might as well be called "Gorilla Golf".  (Crude and unattractive)
polocash::This is a fake,, he looks even worse in person! He only exaggerates in his bb predictions..
truetopia::Haha!  Go Spurs Go!!
truetopia::I never condone using fake pix on a profile..but we need to make an exception for you
JD4REAL::lol @ "Lets Hope"  - why do you consider yourself part of anything?
polocash::cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils. - I'm off this board. I'll be around various ESPN boardsat times during the playoffs. Let's hope someone,ANYONE beats the Spurs during the plaoffs.
