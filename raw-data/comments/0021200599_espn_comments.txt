Miller Park After Dark::ersan finally decides to join the team!
RipCityRedWhiteNBlack::Bummer
nba is the worst::Ilyasova took over?  Wow- tough place to win, especially with Ellis shooting his usual crappy FG%
mr porkchop::sworthin117 - Milwaukee's team is as good as their beer.  Portland's team is as good as their beer.  similar phrases, opposite implications     Milwaukee &gt; Portland
sworthin117::eh, sometimes teams get lucky
mr porkchop::Lol

big145fly::Oh well.. guess ill look to the; Positives: Dlil took Jennings to school.. now if we could just add some depth..
420Legendz::Just got back from the game. Mann the Bucks destroyed the Blazers and I was talkin sh**t the whole time. Loved it. THANKS BUCKS!!
whatthehellbook::The Blazers are killing me... we were playing so well.    http://www.whatthehellbook.com
Kobelies247::No need to panic Blazer fans, still got plenty of games left in the season to turn this thing around!!!  Doesnt really matter you cant beat the Cavs or bucks @ home.....  Youll be fine....
tgreen21::Get lost d-bag!!! Can't stand you!!!
Kobelies247::Owell least the Clippers won.... AGAIN!
theDH24::Portland is coming apart at the seams right on schedule just like every year.
mdkaton::Ima bucks fan but both teams aren't beating anyone decent if they do make the playoffs so any s.hit talking is irrelevant
mr porkchop::Your comment is irrelevant but we shall see, mr psychic.
DISandDAT6::Buck fans are real bold with a 21-18 record.
mr porkchop::Well 3-1 road trip is a start. Gotta do well at some point in the season.
DISandDAT6::Whatever, go Blazers. Rip City
mr porkchop::R.I.P. City or Rip Off City or Rip ( as in torn ) City. What is Rip City??? That just sounds bad. Maybe, he meant Rap City.
FlamingHorseBuffalo::Rip nuff said
aarongb25::wow see the line for OKC denver&gt; OKC only favored -1
Kobelies247::FAIL
DISandDAT6::Losing 5 straight sucks
Bocktor::FEAR THE DEER!!!!!!!!!!!!
FlamingHorseBuffalo::Why do they even let teams like the blazers stay in the league? They are just a lousy farm team that will never compete, lillard should be moved to a team like the bucks and just dump blazers to a lower league
BillWaltonsHair::Well, wisconsin's not michigan, so at least there's that...
big145fly::wow big $@%! talkers really?? Congratulations on beating a team with no bench..You are from Wisconsin you dumb hicks.. call me when you join the 21st century you piece of $@%!...
mr porkchop::1. Everyone here trash talks. Check out the oldest messages.  2. Thanks. 3. Whats wrong or right with Wisconsin? Please enlighten me. Also hicks live in every society including Oregon. J.J. Might be a son of a hick. Lol 4. Hello, we are in the 21st century, you can't change that. I think you watch too much sci- fi movies. I'm mr porkchop not piece of $@%!... or whatever that is.
BillWaltonsHair::Ah, right. Milwaukee. The big time.
mr porkchop::Yep. Milwaukee was big time in the game.
FlamingHorseBuffalo::Fans don't play dumb one
DISandDAT6::One of the best starting 5 in the NBA. Yeah....
DISandDAT6::But how does losing 3 Rose Bowls in a row feel? lol
mr porkchop::Don't mean anything to me. Wisconsin has won Rose Bowls before. What do Rose Bowls have to do with the Bucks/ Blazers game anyway???
DISandDAT6::F.uckin idiot the Blazers have some of the best fans in the NBA.
mr porkchop::Soccer is not a real sport. Lol. We're talking Portland not Eugene.
Kobelies247::They use to..... Not anymore....
DISandDAT6::One of the best MLS crowds for the Timbers.. and they suck. Then one of the best crowds for Oregon football down in Eugene.
mr porkchop::Because its the only show in town.
mr porkchop::Portland Trail Referees
mr porkchop::Bucks &gt; Blazers &amp; Refs
Boshingtang::Where's the idiot who said the Blazers were going to win? You owe me some money
BillWaltonsHair::Yep, jockeying for lottery position begins.
3 fans like this::no shit. Blazers SHOULD be losing
Kobelies247::Portland sucks so bad... Bucks let them get back in it!  Lillard is AMAZING!!!!
FlamingHorseBuffalo::Bucks dominate Portland the land of hippies
BillWaltonsHair::I haven't seen a real hippy in years. Might be a few left in eugene. Mostly hipsters from the midwest now.
Brianhau529::land of logical thinkers
mr porkchop::So does this count as two wins? Bucks beat the Blazers and the Refs.
RipCityFTW::The answer is no, by the way.  The Bucks only get to count their win, not the refs win over the Blazers too.
RipCityFTW::you mean do the bucks get credit for the Refs beating the Blazers?  That was a terrible no call when Udoh knocked Aldridge down at the end.
The Jennings 3::David Stern and his cronies can't win 'em all I guess.
RipCityFTW::Blazers need to get mentally tough.  If they had mental toughness, they would be able to play with a sense of urgency at the beginning of the game, rather than waiting to start every game down by 15-20 points.
The Jennings 3::Bucks taking a huge dump on Portland, on to the next one.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::What does Portland need to be good? They've got a good PG, SG, PF and a decent SF. Do they need a center and a bench?
Boshingtang::They need a new city.
mr porkchop::From what I read on here, Portland cheers for Seattle teams ( Mariners and Seahawks ). If the NBA wants a franchise in Seattle, they should move the Trail Blazers to Seattle. Problem solved. Seattle fans will be happy that they have a team and Portland fans will continue to support the Trail Blazers.   yuriytown to who ever said no one from portland would ever root for a seattle team.......there are lots of people who are mariners fans in oregon......

RipCityFTW::They need a bench.  Seriously, if they had Mike Dunleavy instead of Sasha Pavlovic, they would be a playoff team most likely.
springfresh3.1::Fear my beer, I need one or two after this game
Drle5761::Blazers need Pavlovic.
ClydeTheGlide_22::Double double for Dame
FahrenbrookCt::Can we trade Jennings for Lillard straight up?
ClydeTheGlide_22::No, but you give us Jennings, we will give you our entire bench.
FlamingHorseBuffalo::Blazers suck always and forever
RocHawks::F U Vegas and that BS second half line
WSUMAFU::Portland's bench is terrible.  How could their management let that happen?
Encaladitos::I think they have overachieved as a team. Maybe this team was supposed to suck and get them a high pick.
Pedro5371::ATTA BOYS MILWAUKEE BUCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
springfresh3.1::Yep, it was 5 on 8 tonight, Bucks 5 and Port with the 3 zebras  -Shawn Marion
jmeyes20::Blah blah blah.
aarongb25::If dunleavy took as many shots as ellis or jennings he'd score 40 a night
dcenate05050::wow blazers must be crap if they can't beat a garbage bucks team
stevej2555::If the Bucks won the title you'd still call them a garbage team. Your words are meaningless.
Herkaleez::Bucks will be in the playoffs, Blazers will not.
Drle5761::Yes.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Troll harder.
pdxdgh2012::We need 3s, not twos :(
ViPZE.com::Batum got absolutely owned...who defended him?
d_bokk::Moute and Dunleavy
aarongb25::REFS + opponent and Bucks still dominated.
Encaladitos::Bucks did everything they could to blow this game and still won.
Encaladitos::I swear every team's board has a few people that think refs have a personal vandetta against their team.
aarongb25::Dumb kid, Refs did everything they could.
pacers121::Blazers did everything they could to get blown out and came back.
d_bokk::Danny Crawford*
Hairy Heavy::Bucks need to close out games.
FahrenbrookCt::They did
pdxdgh2012::I dislike the bucks announcers..
springfresh3.1::If it was Skiles, he would have sat on the bench and have that stupid constipated  look on his face
dcenate05050::jennings almost costing the bucks once again. terrible player, teammate
Showtime _832::young money ,won the game if it wasnt 4 bj..-10
RocHawks::lost ball turnover??? WHAT is happening in this game
aarongb25::lol aaron bet on the game that's what is happening
aarongb25::WOW LAS VEGAS CALLED
springfresh3.1::WOW!!!!!!!!!!
aarongb25::see im cursed.
