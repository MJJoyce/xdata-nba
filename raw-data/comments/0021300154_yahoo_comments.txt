Alvin Adiwira::Andre Iguodala.. 11 points on 2/4 shooting including 2/3 from 3. Only missing 1 FT, had 7 rebounds, and 4 assists and 1 steal. Might not sound like an impressive stats, but there is a reason he played for 38+ minutes. He makes everyone around him better. I'm impressed with the way GSW play this year.
C.Jin::Is there a reason David Lee isn't playing many minutes? Is it cause the Warriors have been routing a lot of teams?
Loc::Utah is lowering down.
Loosie::Warriors 109.  Mormons 87.  Stone Cold Lock.
Seattle Blows!::should be another win baby. go Dubs!
Steve Moore::For the love of god Corbin, put Clark in. Stop playing the human loss named lucas
BJ PENN::Splash brothers!!
randy::They'll be better when trey takes over the point
Thomas::DAmnit Bogut  almost  got  a triple double. Godo  job  DUB city.
joker::Slap to the bench putting the starters back in for the last two minutes.  dammit Bezmore
