Errol Thomas Jr::And, James Johnson is kind of consistently killing it.  I know he has been around for a minute and was drafted based on his potential, but man, he has really played like the lottery pick he was projected to be the last several games.  Might have finally found lightning in a bottle!
Will Murphy::Maybe the stats guys are onto something
Errol Thomas Jr::Man, wish we could play the Nuggets more often!  LOL.
Lindsay Frischenmeyer::Grizz have played well the last 4 games. There is hope when Marc gets back.
Timmy Mohsen Harivandi::Lindsay Frischenmeyer I wish you were my teacher!
Landon Pike::I hope to god that prince does not start, the way johnson been playing give the man a chance, plus he's alot better, younger,quicker, faster than prince.i think his defense is alot better too. johnson's offense is obvious better. bc johnson drives to the hole, prince does not. so i dont understand why not play johnson , easy decision.  Everybody in the memphis says and agrees that prince would be alot benificial and better off the bench. why have blogs if mutha fu  dont listen. In memphis we all cant be wrong. LP
Jetpilot Jones::Johnson is a beast
Peter Krane::Go Grizzlies!!
Tyler Spell::put curry in!
Mason Wesley Lloyd::Oh well, next year is going to be awesome. Keep on losing, Knicks.
Phillip Gaines::Let's go curry!!!!!
