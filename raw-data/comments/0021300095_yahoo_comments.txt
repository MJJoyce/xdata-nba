nddreams::I am glad that Al Harrington is helping out consistently.  We are pretty big if he stays productive.
jammin400::Poor shooting display in the first half.  Washington takes the halftime lead but 40% free throws will come back to haunt them.
KEITH::Wash lottery club again.
ShmoeDizzle::Gortat and Beal on the bench way too long in the 4th quarter to prevent that comeback.  Who keeps their starters on the bench in the 4th?
C::ariza 0-5  on free throws -_-
alpha k::Damn why was this so close..?
Seattlesports1::What teams does a Seattle fan go for? Any team that Plays OKC. Go Washington.
chuck d::S.Adams will be rookie of the year!
Frank Shaw::Yeah they miss 13 FTs. Did anyone cover Beal, but a win is a win.
C::Steven Adams you let me down tonight also he needs minutes
