natskivna::The most exasperating team in the NBA....Ladies and Gentlemen....your HOUSTON ROCKETS!  4 game road win streak including wins @ Chicago and @ Lakers.....THEN come home to lose back to back games to the Jazz and Suns?  SMH
kolorec::matt barnes? how about the post game interview with the Polish Machine? Anyone?
Christo677::Ive been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar for a few months now. I have made over 3k a month for 3 consecutive months just following this system. It's on the 1st page of Google when you search the words "sports betting system" Thought I would post this for anyone that's looking for a betting system that actually works.
TubbyTime334::Gortat always Quietly puts up Great Numbers.
AzCards09-10::Great game suns! I am glad to see dragic has found his niche with the rockets.

thenbatmm::Matt Barnes Postgame Interview!!!  PLAYER of the game!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY3ruLx1bKg
itsaboutteam::Camby was always under rated.  Age 40 and still grabbing boards and blocking shots better than most centers.
FatMagic383::18 first half
IAmJonasJones::0 2nd half rebounds
TubbyTime334::Only Teams in Playoff Race that Won were Suns and Mavs.
spraycan::Great effort from the Rockets a supposedly playoff contenting team.
FatMagic383::Supposedly? Contenting?  They are in position to make the playoffs
rocketsin05::Rockets just can't catch a break the last 2 games. The Jazz and tonight the Suns came into Toyota center shooting out of there minds.  The Jazz and Suns both never shoot this well and they pick these games to do it. UNBELIEVABLE LUCK by both the Jazz and Suns.
MiraVos::AND the Suns always seem to shoot well in Toyota center. Take a look at the Suns record AT houston over the last couple of years. It seems to be one of their favorite away arenas.
puttpunjabda::the Suns only shot about 3% better from the field than average. Granted, a lot better from 3 but still. Houston's shooting seemed to be more of a factor, with below average games from behind the arc as well as overall.
Btwixed::this game was a hard fought game by both teams no luck involved suns just happened to come out on top.
TubbyTime334::Dudley was Ice Cold in this Game, in a good way.
AZ D-Backs all day::I thought he was red hot, in a good way.
Meet-The-Forkers::Refs sucked.  They almost lost the game for us. Go Suns!
FatMagic383::No, they won the game for yall. horribly officiated game.
TubbyTime334::Suns Win! Here we come Playoffs!!!
FatMagic383::Good luck with that remaining schedule
darkyam::Nash shouldn't win the MVP, but he deserves a few votes, especially from people who want to throw Love into the conversation.  Neither really has any help but the Suns have a better record and might actually sneak into the playoffs.
AZ D-Backs all day::truth
oczonie::Suns did not collapse in the 4th!  Finally!  They should have closed out those 4th quarter games against Denver and Memphis so they would not be in this position.  Every game is crucial now, gotta gear up for the Spurs next.
AZ D-Backs all day::scola been taking lessons from ginobili
FatMagic383::And winning rings
Notre Dame_Irish::That's because ginobli is a multiple time nba champion
AZ D-Backs all day::champion of flopping
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::Remember: Sports junkies rule and news hounds suck.
Nashmaster3000::Who do the suns want to win rockets or nuggets when they play twice? I was thinking nuggets
IAmJonasJones::suns want nuggets to sweep both if possible because nuggets hold tiebreaker over them  suns can still win tiebreaker vs houston
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::ef nugs
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::YES!!!!! Suns win!. This is a HUGE head to head win vs the Rockets. Hopefully the Nuggets will lose tonight and then we'll be only one game behind both the Rockets and the Nuggets. Tomorrow we see our most hated rivals in the Spurs. It'll be a tough game but nothing could be more satisfying than beating the hateable Spurs in a big game. We'll have to win 6 out of 7 to make the playoffs. We do have an easy game on Monday. I'll sleep well tonight. This was a HUGE win and we're in much better shape than we were to start the day. GO SUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
Notre Dame_Irish::I'm a rockets fan, but I have infinite respect for what the spurs have done. Their franchise is the most admirable small market team. You go nowhere with hate
50goldfinger007::How many peeps here think NASCAR is a real sport??
sridhar2010::lol NASCAR...merry-go-round in a car...grow up and watch F1.
Notre Dame_Irish::It is. You just have to understand its complexities
AZ D-Backs all day::Scola is a punk a$$ b*tch
Shooter_McGavin1::grate game
50goldfinger007::Prediction of Nuggets vs Lakers game tonight folks??  Scores??
AZ D-Backs all day::lakers 100 94
ScottySals::lakers
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::lakers
GrannyDanger332::Nash is going to leave the Suns next year and join the Bulls.
FatMagic383::Not for blackie.
Nashmaster3000::he's gonna stay and well pick up Dwight Howard :)
AZ D-Backs all day::like 7 times bigger
AZ D-Backs all day::phoenix is bigger than orlando.
Notre Dame_Irish::Not gonna happen Dwight's ego is too big for a place like Phoenix
azballa04::.
ScottySals::.
AZ D-Backs all day::.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::.
gotemcoach92::Next 5 games for the Suns could all be losses
maynarddavid::According to accuscore, we could always lose lol. What an amazing run we're on!
ODBPHX::I WAS GONNA SAY GOOD GAME ROCKETS BUT $@%! THEM FLOPPERS!!!
AZ D-Backs all day::real talk
GOSKP 2.52::how many gb are you now suns?
Syracuse_Orange44::uno or dos
Arizona_Sting::Go SUNS!
maynarddavid::4 or 5*
maynarddavid::Big-time win, brother! 4 or 6 more and we're golden! So pumped how everything in the West went down tonight... WE ARE ORNG!
jamessharp24::pizza hut pizza
mrhog1::they dont know what the hell there doing out there.   a bunch of little school girls
Arizona_Sting::GG  Houston.
ODBPHX::IF THERE WAS A 7 POINT PLAY THE REFS WOULD CALL IT WITH THE QUIKNESS. . . . .SUNS BAYYYBEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Casey_Tatum::screw you rockets.
Woffar::This win was huge....
gotemcoach92::Nash is just as big of a flopper as Scola
Dr. Jack Rose::so your telling me that Nash grabs defenders then throws himself on the ground to get calls??? your argument is moot
I read about it.. In a book.::Free throws are even... Houston actually had way more until the end here... so no blaming the refs.
Casey_Tatum::i will enjoy watching HOU lose every one of their remaining games.
DetroitSportsFan84279::I'm not watching the game, what's scola been doing?
Skip1.4ppg Bayless::sucking a guys dick on the court
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::and budinger because they both mad g.ay
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::each ref
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::nash padding for my fantasy team &lt;3
JustDza::Dragic for most improved player. Not Lin, not Anderson. Only guy running with him is Ersanity.
JoeBoxer249::The key to all their improvements is playing time due to injury.  Except Ersan
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::yeah but a big is a big. gooden starts at center now and he is a pf isn't he? bogut and gooden together over gooden and ersan.
JustDza::I guess but they play different positions. And now Bogut is gone
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::ersan got a lot because of bogot tho right?
JustDza::And Monroe.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::and maybe hayward?
JustDza::YAAA him too lol. There's a lot of guys who stepped up this season. It'll be a difficult award to hand out.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::whada bout gortat?!?! :p
JustDza::He's had good games, but not consistent like Dragic.
jamessharp24::Monroe
JustDza::Shouldn't be awarded to a guy on a terrible team.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::cousins?
JustDza::Okay I should've added Monroe. He's definitely been balling.
cardsfan012::omg its over stop fouling
mrhog1::what a joke these guys are.
Arizona_Sting::Nuggets should lose to the Lakers. At least I hope so
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::go suns!   Mavs and Nuggs gon be losing tonight
Skip1.4ppg Bayless::you forget the nugs have my boy JAVALE MCGEE!!
Casey_Tatum::what scola does has nothing to do with the game of basketball.
Syracuse_Orange44::Go Suns! Steve Nash has been my favorite player since i was like 9
Los suns::Houston cant win with refs giving them 8 free throws?  OUCH!!!  GO SUNS!
