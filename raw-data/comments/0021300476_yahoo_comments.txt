James::I didn't see the game but both teams shot a good percentage and not a whole lot of rebounds, and the score was not too high so I am assuming the Nets slowed the ball down.    Which is their only hope of beating any of the young, good teams.    Williams has to forget about running.   Slow it down and take and make shots off the set offense.    Keep the score in the low nineties or high eighties and execute the last couple of possessions.   This is the only way this club can win.   Any good team that can get to 100 beats the Nets.     Go Nets (please)!
Austin::When a team shoots 12 more free throws then the Thunder, they have a good shot of winning. The Thunder lead the league in free throw attempts, but didnt have that advantage tonight.
Dave::Perhaps they can build on this?  I mean, what the heck, they are in the atlantic division!
Steven R::KD ain't a leader, hell of a ball player but I really wonder if he's a winner.
Scott::Lamb is +14 and Sefolosha is -15, but Lamb gets 12 fewer minutes!  That's two games in a row that you've hurt us, Coach!
Trace Mann::How can Brooklyn be this awful, they not even competitive. it is amazing Billy King is still employed!
KHAR T::New York is the worst sport city in USA. Jets, Giants, Nets, Knicks, Rangers, Yankees, Mets - they all pathetic teams   with the huge payrolls  but no playoff appearances.
Truth Be Told::Joe Johnson is just stealing money. Hawks are so lucky the Nets were dumb enough to take that absurd contract.
gary::OKC was sleep walking tonight. Boy oh boy!
Frank Shaw::KD has to get killer instinct that last portion of game Jordan, Kobe and Lebron demand ball. Shoot or get fouled. Heck Russell said to shoot to much but he forces the issues. Go down in flames or come smelling like a rose
