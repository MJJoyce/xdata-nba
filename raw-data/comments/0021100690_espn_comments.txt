WillGonzo::Good win for the Spurs. I like what I saw, minus Parker. Up next: Dallas. Time to open up a serious can of whoop $@% and layith down thy smack. We still haven't forgotten about last Saturday's loss. Gonna be a good Texas shootout. Getcha popcorn ready!!!!!
luvnbayes::Two things:  1)  Jackson will be a difference maker, and looks just great.   2)  Manu Ginobili is a joy to watch.
John Michael00::7/Ginobli will only get better 8/Splitter is a fantastic backup!
luvnbayes::Which all adds up to the Spurs being the team to beat in the West.
angelocody::5.) Tony Parker is having the best season of his career. 6.) Gary Neal is one of the best bench players in the league.
joemcleod83::3) Timmy looks 5 years younger. 4) Kawhi is gonna be a beast in this league for a long time.
threetimechamp210::They should be called the Timberlands cause the Spurs kicked their a$$!
WillGonzo::Doesn't matter if Rubio or Pek played in the game. The Spurs are hungry and angry. MN has a lot of potential and should come out next season on fire. MN and Denver are two teams that are going to make serious noise next season. Good win for the Spurs. Cheers!!
mn_tanz::MN is still 2-1 against SA this year.  And this game was played without Rubio and Pekovic.
The. North. Star. State.::Rubio is done we all know that.  But this team really needs Pek.  We aren't going to win any games if Love is playing center.
samba.hane::I hate the fact that Beasley isnt starting instead of Webster. Hes obviously a much better shooter. His numbers have dropped dramatically form last year.
luvnbayes::Beasley couldn't guard you.  That made no difference to Rambis, but Adelman actually cares about winning.
boeheim needs a ballboy::Break out the Geritol again ...
Giggity.iggity::"Kevin who?"  - Tim Duncan
bogringo79::were good without parker for now. it doesnt look serious. Thats why we have jackson now and the rest of the beast. Complete team no doubt.
THE AMAZING CHEF REBORN::YOU HERE OTHER CHEF
Amazing Chef Returns..::YES I MADE IT
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::Haha poor Wolves...the best year you have had in years and you still suck.
Bricky Rubios Knee Says Hi::UTES.JAZZ.NINERS - Haha poor Wolves...the best year you have had in years and you still suck.  LOL
theyorkallday::NBA players draft, all players are eligible... lebron goes #1 kobe goes late, wall goes #9 blake goes #6 full draft: http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
Hammered_Cubs_Fan2.0::"Stephen Jackson and Gary Neal showed they can step up if needed, scoring 16 points for the Spurs (30-14), who won their fourth straight game and fifth in their last six."  Spurs have won "four straight" even though we lost our previous game to this one??!   SERIOUSLY?!?!? This site literally employs circus-monkeys as their writers...
The Amazing Chef Returns.::Come join me fellow wolves fans on the Mavs board
THE AMAZING CHEF REBORN::SHUT UP YOU WANNABE
XxLeprechaunxX::have fun with that
XxLeprechaunxX::I will never turn to the dark side! lol
The Amazing Chef Returns.::WHO CARES JOIN ME. ODERICKS FANS NEED TO KNOW WOLVES OWN THEM
XxLeprechaunxX::you probably didnt notice, but we also lost
The Amazing Chef Returns.::stupid oldericks fans lost. Now it is our time. WOLVES BABY
smiles355::let randolph play more!
Im Lebrons Hairline::Next year lakers should trade:    Sessions for Rubio    then memphis should trade:    rudy gay for derrick williams and pekovic    minnesota will then have a: GAY LOVE SESSIONS trio
XxLeprechaunxX::was clever the first time i heard it now its really quite lame the 3504th time
Bricky Rubios Knee Says Hi::that joke was invented on this board
Bricky Rubios Knee Says Hi::The fact is, the Wolves are finding out they don't need Bricky Rubio in the line up. They psyched themselves out. They will probably go on a little run when they pull their collective heads out of their ass
mn_tanz::I think their poor record and horrendous defensive showings without Rubio has shown exactly the opposite.
XxLeprechaunxX::Its possible, but other players have to get healthy first, like Pek and Beasley, if they dont play solid minutes down the stretch this team isnt going anywhere but down the rest of the year.  Just not enough talent
linus9891::what happened to ridnour?
XxLeprechaunxX::the force wasnt with him tonight
anonymous_sports_watcher__::Duncan is having a great year...turn back the clock baby!
Bricky Rubios Knee Says Hi::JJ Barea had a better game than Rubio had all season.  Think about that.
XxLeprechaunxX::absolutely untrue, and again please change your username to something less offensive please?
mn_tanz::Compare the defensive showing with Rubio to the defensive showings without Rubio.  Personally, I think he's underrated because most people brush him off, thanks to his shooting performance.
XxLeprechaunxX::garbage time stats do not equal real game stats, also i hate having to defend rubio cause i personally think hes overrated but your comment just wasnt true
Bricky Rubios Knee Says Hi::Look at his stats. It's very true.
XxLeprechaunxX::Wolves fan here, but the Spurs are far and away my 2nd fav team hope you guys light it up in the playoffs! (P.S. wolves still took season series :) )
WillGonzo::Sorry about the bad luck with injuries for your team. MN is actually a lot better than their record indicates. If there is one coach who can save this team it is definitely Adelman. The Spurs will always be my top team, But I like where teams like MN and Denver are headed. Young teams destined for playoff success. Be patient young Jedi, the force is strong.
Txboy12345::I thought Stephen Jackson was like 25% on 3s? Oh I guess he did bad so he could be traded to the Spurs :)
Txboy12345::I didn't know old players can do 21/15
joemcleod83::IN JUST 24 MINUTES!
ididnotairballijustmisstheshot::ANYON SEE LINSANITY TODAY 6 in a row..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHtJ9EaafsU
WesTexSpur::Is it just me or does Chicago have a weak a$$ schedule?
WillGonzo::The Bulls are going to win it all, even with Boozer in the line up. Damn.
Txboy12345::It seems like it but they have beat some great teams without Rose.
CandySparker::2 weeks to return
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::As long as they play like they did tonight....TP can take his time recovering.....even though he's the main piece to this team! He controls the tempo! Tony Parker I say is up there for the MVP!
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Tiiiiiiiimmmmmmmmbbbbbbweeerrrrr went the wolves!!!!!!!
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Oh you know what I mean...haha!
XxLeprechaunxX::timbwer?
u2rocksme::Kawhi is the man. SDSU up and coming.....
joemcleod83::Such a Beast.. Surprises me more and more every game..Showed a sick spin move today that i hadn't seen yet from him.  Future all star for sure
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::@SpursWarz...I was waiting for those idiots to respond to me....they're weak idiots!
SpurzWarz::I know, "legends in their own minds!"
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::They're idiots....lol.
SpurzWarz::Did you notice that strong troll &amp; Rayfinkle told similar jokes (all weak) &amp; Strongtroll appeared when I was gaining the upper hand on Rayfinkle! I think head butter is also a Rayfinkle account!
SpurzWarz::Bruce rules!
SpurzWarz::I experienced the same thing on the NBA Gametime app! Multiple accounts with multiple personalities. It was probably Rayfinkle, except there was no "like" feature! Probably starve for attention!
XxLeprechaunxX::ESPN should really think about banning IP addresses, cause stuff like this really has no place, and you know the people who do it aren't gonna stop othwewise
SpurzWarz::He is also head butter!
XxLeprechaunxX::nice work sir, ive been noticing a few multi-username folks around here lately, one of em even had 2 computers and was talking to himself lol crazy people
XxLeprechaunxX::hey yo i missed the game, but reading the comments... you sure rayfinkle is strong troll? cause i was actually thinking that a few days ago lol
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Bruce ” Bow” Bowen!!!!! The Specialists in Defensive Skills!!!!!
anonymous_sports_watcher__::and a class act
XxLeprechaunxX::Well im glad i missed this one lol
tubbytime88::Hope you didn't miss the Gophers at least!
XxLeprechaunxX::Nope, i made sure to see my gophers! :)   Rodney Williams 3 straight career highs!
anonymous_sports_watcher__::Bruuuuuuuuuce!
headbutter15::Suprised nobody is arguing
Foghorn HookemHorns::Having Jack, Manu, TP, Timmy! and the rest of the great, team-oriented Spurs healthy in the playoffs I guarantee the Spurs will go deep. Definitely WC Finals.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Gregg Popovich= Coach of The Year!
Foghorn HookemHorns::No doubt! But as usual, he won't win it. Just like Jerry Sloan could have won it five times.  This year, they'll probably give it to Scotty Brooks or even Mike Brown or something ridiculous.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::I'll agree with you...even though alot of naysayers say the Spurs are old just because Tim is 35 and the rest are younger!
Foghorn HookemHorns::Only Tim  and Manu are "old". Jack is 33. He's got at least two to three more years.  The critics are only hoping the Spurs are old and over the hill. Guarantee no one wants the Spurs in the playoffs this year.
Foghorn HookemHorns::Duncan straight-up SCHOOLING K. Love. Guess the greatest PF ever still has some left.
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::Pretty sure Duncan has played the Center position his entire career except when D.Robinson was there. Twin towers...aka 2 centers. Am I wrong?
AnthonyValdez2381::Wld have to agreed
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Agreed!
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Goooooooooooooooooooooooooo Bruce!!!!!
anonymous_sports_watcher__::#12!
headbutter15::Oh don't care
Foghorn HookemHorns::Bruce and his rings care not for you either. Move along.
Frantismo::Wow, real quick to call some one an idiot, that's Bruce Bowen's jersey number that they retired tonight. I won't call you an idiot though...
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Ahhhhh.......the retiring of Bruce Bowen's number!!!!!
headbutter15::What is that about idiot
Foghorn HookemHorns::Yeah, headbutter, he's the idiot.  Pay attention to the NBA sometime, little kid. Bruce Bowen. #12. Dominant defensive stopper and key player in the Spurs MULTIPLE NBA championships.
anonymous_sports_watcher__::bruce bowen $@%!$@%
THE_HULK74::So will Stephen Jackson screw up his second stint with the Spurs and think he deserves a huge contract and go to another team?  How long before he is a free agent?  Seems like forever since he was a Spur.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::I don't think so....he showed his talent tonight.
Malcyon1::Barea &gt; Bricky Rubiho
WeAreTheMIB::Smart move to pull Parker.  SJax and Neal can handle the load if TP needs to rest that hammy.  Win #30, baby!!!  GO SPURS GO!!!!!
headbutter15::jj barea is awesome
anonymous_sports_watcher__::time to retire the #12!
rayfinkle165::spurzwarz we already posted at the same time proving your theory wrong you stupid fucking felching sister fucker
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Oh well...you choose then...your mom or your wife! Haha
headbutter15::i was kidding
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Oh well then your wife! Lol
headbutter15::My mom is dead
SpurzWarz::Another Rayfinkle account that's three,head butter!
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::That's not what your mom said about me!^
SpurzWarz::No one believes your sh it you say, just rad all the post made against you!
headbutter15::your'e an idiot dude ^
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::You're weak dude!^
rayfinkle165::WHAT?! get an education you stupid $@%!$@% texan
SpurzWarz::Strongtroll is a closet Klu Klux Kln Member with aNAzi flag in his basement! Skin head troll!
SpurzWarz::Keep talking strongtroll or should I say Rayfinkle!
headbutter15::yeh you and him and probably his other account
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Mad much?^
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::He's got three idiot!^
headbutter15::quit liking your own comments
denveraic::Jackson in 2 games already a much better fit than Jefferson was in 2 and a half years. Great trade by the Spurs!
glstreet1974::He knows the system. Spurs should stream the waiver wire, who knows what might be there?
anonymous_sports_watcher__::i agree
Strong Troll Forventhrund::Keep talking Spurzwarz, someday you'll say something intelligent!
SpurzWarz::Rayfinkle makes up bogus post comment to cover his @$$, like his boyfriend strongtroll!0
AnthonyValdez2381::The Spurs!!!!! I c nba finals this yr
WesTexSpur::Why did Parker only play 10 min? He didnt get hurt did he??
ryantorch96::i also thought parker got injured. hopefully rest of the spurs are healthy by playoff time
denveraic::Didn't need him.
glstreet1974::Duh?!
glstreet1974::Yeah, if the Spurs were playing a real team, maybe he keeps playing, but c'mom it's the Wolves, lol. GG TWolves, two weeks from Opening Day! GN.
WesTexSpur::Hopefully that doesnt turn into a dang nuisance. And its always good if he can get a rest.
WesTexSpur::Oh ok. I was about to say shiiii.iiiiiit!
TheHoMaster::It's a good move on Pop's part.
Egr_69_Dallas_Cowboys_5_Time_World_Champs::Tightness on his hamstring
sundine0639::he was pulled out as a precautionary measure but he will be fine
glstreet1974::Pop was like, hey it's the Wolves, why bother, lol
