ESPNisBSNEWZ::didnt watch the game...but how do you managed to get killed by 20 in the 4th??? when youre already down 15???
TorontoSportsDynasty::The Magic gave up in the 4th. They were letting the Raptors soot 3s all day.
TorontoSportsDynasty::Raptors are playing so much better without Bargnani.
RealAndreaBargnani::When I come back we will be unbeatable!
dromaeos::it smells like tomato sauce ... oh no, $@%! it's you1
PEdRO2757::Man this game was a rape-fest
tirvine1::Raps main PGs had quite the game (between them)...31 pts, 16 assists and only 2 turnovers...hopefully when JVal and Bargs come back the team will gain even more momentum (personally, I'd love to see Bargs brought back in a sixth man role; he may not initially embrace it but I think it'll be a good fit for him and the team)...regardless, loving that the Raps are playing well.
tjbey2000::Anyone know if Ayon got hurt for Orlando ? Nicholson had a nice game
bigjoe93ATLANTA::lolmagic
Its_on_sucka::No Dwight, no excuse for shooting 50% from the line Orlando!!!
toronto-vigilante3::Now, if my Bears make the playoffs tomorrow, it'll be a perfect weekend.....!
66detroitlions::Won't happen
toronto-vigilante3::66detroitlions - You need to much help plus megatron going for 2000 _________________________________  SImple:  1) Bears need to beat Detroit 2) GB needs to beat Minny, since they're playing for home field.  I like their chances.
66detroitlions::You need to much help plus megatron going for 2000
toronto-vigilante3::How do you figure?
gri400::man did they come crashing down
gri400::knew about the O-line and the quality of teams they faced, but didn't keep to up to date on their injuries (had forte and culter for fantasy so i knew about them though)
toronto-vigilante3::I didn't take into account Seattle or Minny.
toronto-vigilante3::If you followed them, their O-LINE sucks, they had injuries, and they played good teams in the second half...I had them going 10 - 6 and barely making the playoffs...
toronto-vigilante3::Lockout...day 105......HA!
toronto-vigilante3::Nope.
Alex_TO::Is there actually any hope for this season?
toronto-vigilante3::Jan 11th is D-DAY
