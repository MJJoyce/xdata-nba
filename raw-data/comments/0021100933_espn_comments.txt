yerdon4669::Timberwolves with Rubio: 21-22, without Rubio: 5-18.  Hard to believe a little boy from Spain can make such a difference.
mn_tanz::Actually, with Rubio, the Wolves were 21-20.  WIthout him, they are 5-18.    And they were 3-7 while he was on the bench, which makes the difference all the more astounding.  Five games above .500 when the kid starts, 17 games below when he doesn't.

Markansas5377::Only 80 points at home vs. the Wolves? So does this mean the Pistons are completely done for  the season? I at least expected them to try to maintain some level of respect, but damn. LOL
XxLeprechaunxX::Awesome a win in april, now to end the April home losing streak which dates all the way back to 2008.
Dolp23hins::good win heat. Bulls fans are a joke
BeastAwesome15::I agree, $@%!$@%
dogs::I agree
BeastAwesome15::I agree
J-SMOOVE2071::SPAMMERS NEED TO CHILL OUT ON THAT HEAT VS BULLS BOARD
dogs::Sup guys.
J-SMOOVE2071::HEAT WIN BABY
SFEST13::Sorry guys, the Miami/ Chicago board was a LITTLE too crowded, so I came here to talk about how the Bulls won't go anywhere in the playoffs.
AltQuill::thank you
BeastAwesome15::Who's here?
dogs::Not me
Trexxus::Omg, was on the phone all night, missed this game and the Twins, dammit. GG Wolves ending the April losing streak.
dogs::Dang dude
ZonaWildcats_2170::Finaly a win(: Congradulations!
--..bullster..--::bulls need to find some offense and quick.  too many jacked up 3s
TubbyTime334::WE WON!!! Shocking!!!
KobeBuildsHouseWithBricks::The wolves better have more than 2 national tv games next year, and ive seen GS on ESPN like 5 times this year WTF!?!?
PhilMNAP::Wolves will be good next year. Can't wait.
awbrandt34::only so many teams play at that time they only can choose from west coast teams
wolves_fan77::and that is also a good point
wolves_fan77::I feel much the same
Cash Money75::I'm sure they will. Rubio and Love can put on quite a show.
Cash Money75::Go Hornets!
neymar079::i luv it when detroit loses
GoMNSports924::FINALLY
Cash Money75::I forgot, do we need Utah to make the playoffs or miss the playoffs to keep our pick?
Doc Emmett L Brown::It's only lottery protected. If the Jazz missed the playoffs, they'd keep it regardless. Jazz will probably finish with the 7 seed, so the pick would be  around 16 or so.
wolves_fan77::well it will not be lottery so it is soley on record after that...and possibly positioning in the playoffs i kinda forget
KobeBuildsHouseWithBricks::So is the pick a guaranteed top 15 pick or what?
Doc Emmett L Brown::And us Jazz fans want you to have it.
Doc Emmett L Brown::Minnesota wants the Jazz to MAKE the playoffs, to get that pick.
wolves_fan77::make
Doc Emmett L Brown::THANK YOU WOLVES!!! This may have just secured the Jazz getting their pick from the tanking, classless, Golden State "Warriors."
Zippppppp::just wait until the ping pong balls fall
wolves_fan77::?
Doc Emmett L Brown::Yes. GS is classless.
wolves_fan77::alright I think I've got it...was having a bit troubles understanding if your suggesting gs is classless, I would agree.
Doc Emmett L Brown::Jazz need Golden State to stay out of the top 7. Beating Detroit was a big help. We will reward you with our pick because we are making the playoffs.
KobeBuildsHouseWithBricks::If the Rockets lose tonight then its a 2-team race for the 8th seed in the west! LETS GO JAZZ!
relentlessind127::Lets hope the bobcats get the number one pick..cause they are awful..or the Wizards...those are the two worst teams in my opinion..the hornets will lose Eric Gordon and be terrible as well...ha
wolves_fan77::gordon
KobeBuildsHouseWithBricks::Gordon will be a FA he and JR Smith are who we should pursue this offseason.
wolves_fan77::the hornets are also probably not going to over spend to keep the guy
Doc Emmett L Brown::Brand new owner. I guarantee they will match any offer.
Doc Emmett L Brown::Gordon is a RFA. He's not going anywhere.
wolves_fan77::yep...I cant stress how much more I dont care about our pick not being owned knowing a team like the hornets own it rather than the clips
Raidersbo913::vegas is good  detroit -7 push 2nd half
GayNewYorkBaseballlFan::Yankees suck fatty weiner.
Qster15::game isn't over and they shaking hands.. fouls all over the place LOL
denn19641::I could only hope for Monroe's consistency and McKnight's progress. Winning no longer matters for the Pistons for the remaining games.
Paul6250::Who the FOOK are you tryin to fool Pistons ..You DIRTY CHEATING BA*$@%!$??!!! you start playin in the last quarter ..just when you know you're too far behind to win!!!! You PATHETIC excuse for a team!!!!
Paul6250::Yeah they deserve to do $@%!...n let's hope they do!!!!
wolves_fan77::ya...i mean I see how they did the lottery with anyone that dont make the playoffs but I could actually see them condensing the amount of teams that make it. pretty good idea actually
Paul6250::Hey..I DONT think anythin...I KNOW for a fookin FACT!!! A team that don't score a single point for 6 minutes in a game ...then goes n scores 40 in last 10 !!!!! A complete joke....no thought for the fans that turned up to watch em!!! A bunch of complete WANKERS!!!
wolves_fan77::I have seen good teams go on stretches nearly that long dude...but again..its the lottery so they may purposely tank and ended up doing poorly in the lottery and that would serve them right, huh
relentlessind127::there should be a lottery between the NBA's 3 worst teams in my opinion that way..theres no way the worst team ends up with the 4th or 5th pick like we did all those years...we ended up with a 2 in the league's argueable most terrible draft ever...thats what you call bad luck..as well as taking Foye over Rudy Gay..haha
wolves_fan77::Well i hate the lottery but it is definately there for that reason.
relentlessind127::thinks they are trying to lose to get higher odds in the draft lottery
wolves_fan77::what does cheating have to do with anything?
Qster15::they caught their 4th wind...hahahaha.. 6 games in 8 days will tire you out
Qster15::sh.t games is over.. whats the point of calling a T.O.? wasting time or delaying the loss
relentlessind127::WOLVES WIN...WOLVES WIN!!! IN APRIL OMFG....
Qster15::holy FLOP!!!
GoMNSports924::WOLVES Y U NO HOLD LEAD?
KobeBuildsHouseWithBricks::Can somebody please explain too me the draft situation for us if the Jazz make the playoffs!?!??!?!?!
KobeBuildsHouseWithBricks::The Jazz are currently the 8th seed :)
wolves_fan77::yep...this is one of the deepest drafts in recent history might as well get the pick now especialy with no pick of our own...maybe can package another player to move up a bit
relentlessind127::hense why the Jazz are my new favorite team :D
wolves_fan77::yep
KobeBuildsHouseWithBricks::so too make a long story short if the Jazz make the playoffs we could have a potential top 20 pick!?!??!
colinster_00::Yeah we would get the Jazz pick from a trade not involved with the Hornets at all!
relentlessind127::they do...and we have the rights to the Jazz's lottery protected pick..meaning we dont get the jazz's pick if they dont make the playoffs....
KobeBuildsHouseWithBricks::But i thought the Hornets had the rights to our pick!?!?!??!?!
colinster_00::We get the pick if the Jazz make the playoffs, because it is lottery protected..
wolves_fan77::simple..they make playoffs, wolves get their pick
Qster15::Still pretty pathetic to allow a tired Pistons team to run up 30+ pts on you in the last quarter...
relentlessind127::no Love...no Ridnour..no Rubio...the fact we even won in Detroit is a miracle to me..the team without those 3 guys is garbage..
relentlessind127::this is hilarious..hahah
Qster15::game is over... Wolves would have to be the new Bobcats to lose up by 7pts with FTs coming and about 45 seconds to play
zaruji::Why do the pistons just now start playing?????
wolves_fan77::pretty much
Qster15::typical NBA... winning team up by 15pts sit back and jack-off on the bench.. allowing the other team's A squad to catch up against the bench team
wolves_fan77::the wolves may have also started not playing
Qster15::3 Stooges!!! how long does it take to review a play? Blind Refs.
woooooooooo0000000000::wolves you suck!...you just quit playing! your giving away points
saralee509::nice game stinky stukey!!! not......
RockyMountainWay1::Anyone know when Kevin Love is returning?
wolves_fan77::possibly next game..along with luke
relentlessind127::i like how the buy bounces off pek trying to block the shot...hahah PEK
juno71::come on pistons!
