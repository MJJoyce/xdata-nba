akphidelt2007::Rockets are too fast for this oldass team
cmaster96::Lin would play more of a factor if they bench Harden instead because Harden treats the ball like his butt buddy
jamessss41::Rondo is a turnover machine!!!
Glenagglenag::some of you keep saying lin should do this and that, but haven't you seen how sampson or mchale always stand up and even scream to jlin when he has the ball in his hand.  i think they want him to pass  to harden right away or anyone else.  if he doesn't follow he's probably gonna be benched.
cmaster96::He keeps getting bench because he is not able to utilize his talents because harden is a ball hodge
NoonGame::Lin is too humble and not aggresive to score...Wonder why he kept getting bench...
westbrook47::why did the rockets have green on jerseys
carlvu1::In honor of McHale's daughter passing .
cm13182::Why can't the Rockets just end the Kevin McHale experiment and go after a real championship caliber coach like Phil Jackson or Rudy Tomjanovich?  Why do they spend so much money on players to have them coached by someone who’s never coached a team into the playoffs in a collegiate or professional level?
vonsteve6868::Good win Rockets. I couldn't care less who starts when you win.
TheKilbo::Bass and Pierce's inconsistent shooting is killing us this year.
NewYorkSportsLife19::Ya man. How about Green? I dont watch you guys alot but when I do, Green plays bad
NewYorkSportsLife19::Fact is the Rockets are better when Lin is on Bench. Anyway, thankyou Rockets for beating the crap out of the Celtics. CELTICS STINK!!!!!  :P
TheKilbo::You got something against black irish (e.g. Pierce, Garnett)?
NewYorkSportsLife19::lol no
NewYorkSportsLife19::Didnt mean it like that, Just saying Lin should play off the bench because when Harden plays, Lin is very passive. Anyway, I'm just happy you guys took care of those Green Irish Mutts for us!
Olivia2920::I like Harden better on the Thunder :( it's so weird seeing him on the Rockets but I'm very happy he's playing well
NewYorkSportsLife19::Agreed, and both sides are better off. Martin may not be the better player but for whatever reasonm he gives more contributions off the bench than Harden did. IMO I would rather Martin, not sure why everyone sais Harden is better just because of his stats when he plays almost 40 mins a night and shoots ALOT of shots
tfloyd66::greg smith is proof the d-league works - when you put in the time and effort  royce white is a joke
NguyenDragon::Anybody else tired of seeing his rant on Twitter?  What a waste of a pick...
Excelscior1::Disgusting loss.   Celtics played like they didn't care--from the start-- in a very winnable game.   What a pathetic defensive and offensive effort (especially around the basket).
NguyenDragon::Houston is a young team with a lot of talent so anything can happen... This is a rebuilding team that is a bit further than what people expected...
NoonGame::Lin also need to wake up and be more aggressive...he's too passive/ humble and too unselfish...nice guy finish last in this league...
carlvu1::Lin shows that he can drop 38 points on a great team when he controls the ball.
Phatepiclewts::Look at Rondo, he's one of the best point guards in the league and he's an awful shooter. But he's a pure point guard, all assists and rebounds, like Lin is aiming toward. I think that's a mistake, Lin's more a scoring point guard, but you definitely can play like Lin has the past few games and still be an all star.
NewYorkSportsLife19::His shooting is actually getting much much better
Tuoi56::If the Rockets team mates decide to be selective as to who they pass the ball to.  And decide to avoid passing to LIn, (watch the TV, Lin goes to corner waves his hands for a pass), the ball movements won't be there.  Rockets, better keep passsing the ball and create opening man for a shot.   NOt Harden or Parsons trying to ball hog way to a score or not passing to LIn and try to do ball movements?? it's not gonna work when your PG is not involved.
NewYorkSportsLife19::They won by alot. Do you care about the teams success or Lins? You over-exaggerated, they are willing to pass it but not if he is behind the 3-point line in the corner becasuse he cant shoot there. He makes it seem like he wants nothing to do with the ball on offense.
FLC-8R::The dumb part is because of this, they became very predictable.  No one needs to guard Lin since no one is going to pass him the ball anyway...
Tuoi56::Where is the ball movements with this fu cking Rockets team??  Lin dribbles up the half court, passes to Harden, goes to corner and  that's it. The ball movement ends with the PG right there.   The PG is waving his hands at the corner, but Harden ends the ball movements from there on.  Even Parsons, Patterson and Asik they do not know the ball movement and creating open shots.  Coach better fix this fast.
FLC-8R::I also saw alot of lazy passes last night that got stolen by C.
NguyenDragon::To be fair Lin needs to take some blame for being passive when Harden is on the court...
NguyenDragon::FLC-8R - I am curious if the coach asked him to be that way or if he is being passive on his own.  Many people raised this question but there had been no answers so far.  I guess that is the million dollar question...
FLC-8R::I am curious if the coach asked him to be that way or if he is being passive on his own.  Many people raised this question but there had been no answers so far.
NguyenDragon::I like to see Lin make the initial drive... The decision will be his to whether dish or shot/layup...
Tuoi56::yes, but where is the ball movement? when LIN passes to Harden, Harden better pass back to LIn, lin to Harden, Harden to Parsons. Back to LIn and keep moving the ball by passing to each other.  But, for fu cking Rockets, there is ball movements and it ends with Harden trying to score by himself.
twinsfan184::This was the No. 1 game on the ESPN website for most of Friday night....until the Celtics lost and then it quickly falls off the screen.  Amazing how that works on ESPN.
Kobah-Bryne::Lin is a fraud...How in the hell he's only trailing Kobe and CP3 in all star voting for guards??? Any guard not named Jeremy Lin is better than Jeremy Lin, with his 30% FG shooting.
Tuoi56::He's good that's why. Houston does not know how to utilize LIn
NBA1964::Allstar is based on fan voting, not stats.  Nothing new this year.
NguyenDragon::It has always been a popularity vote... Why are you complaining now?
utexasfan1::Someone like to xplain why Lin looks so lethargic on the court but was hyped as being the 2nd coming? So far, waste of money, in my opinion. On the other hand, the bearded one is on fire, man needs help, more help I should say.
FLC-8R::Need to trade Lin. He is waste of space in Houston
peakarach::lol! Waste of space??????????
NguyenDragon::I am assuming you haven't been watching the games... Lin can play... He just cant play with Harden... Their style don't mesh... That is the puzzle that McHale needs to solve... A garbage player just don't have multiple 30 plus games against Spurs, Lakers, etc.... I doubt he will ever be a superstar but he has the potential to be a star...
Phatepiclewts::Lin is good at the pick and roll. He needs a good PF to rack up assists and to clear lanes to the basket. Asik has already proved good at center, but Patrick Patterson is pretty bad. Houston should focus on finding a good PF. Amar'e Stoudemire would be disgustingly good on this team -- if only Houston had players to trade for him. Or move Harden to the 4 and start Delfino or Douglas at the 2.
NguyenDragon::BXwarriorBX - so who can lin play with he had melo now harden  Role players based upon what we seen here and NY last season...
BXwarriorBX::so who can lin play with he had melo now harden
NguyenDragon::It seems like Lin will be the odd man out since Harden is the first option... He is just going to have to learn to play with Harden or spend more time on the bench...
NewYorkSportsLife19::Nguyen I just read your earlier comment and I could not agree with you more bro. Lin should be playing the role that Harden played on OKC and play off the bench. The problem is, Harden plays like 37-38 minutes a night so Lin wouldnt have much time at all to run his team on his own so I think he just needs to stop being so passive when Harden is in or cut Hardens minutes down and see how that works
NguyenDragon::I wish Morey can get Kevin Love... Him and Asik will be a rebounding force...
gralsa::I predict Rockets end up with K Love.  That is who McCale and Morey really want (reminds McCale of himself); D Howard is a smoke screen.  They have the assets and cap room to do it.  Wait and see.  Returns Houson to a top 4 team....
NewYorkSportsLife19::I would love for my Knicks to get one of them, even though Stoudemire's coming back soon. Stat will most likely play off the bench which is best, so if we got another top-notch PF, wow Knicks would be scary.
NguyenDragon::NewYorkSportsLife19 - Oh my gosh yes. Plus the other two 1st round picks you guys got would be solid by next year. Still think they should have used one of there other 1st round picks in the Harden trade rather than Lamb  OKC wanted Lamb... Hell they also asked for Parsons but Morey finally drew the line... I wish we would have given up our pick instead of Toronto's though...
NewYorkSportsLife19::Oh my gosh yes. Plus the other two 1st round picks you guys got would be solid by next year. Still think they should have used one of there other 1st round picks in the Harden trade rather than Lamb
NguyenDragon::When this season started I was thinking Houston might need at least 2 years to contend... I think with Love that time could be cut in half... Once the young bench solidifies Rockets could be really deep... DMo and TJones haven't even seen that many minutes yet...
NewYorkSportsLife19::BTW I agree with him on wanting out. He proved he is a team-player IMO but you can only take so much. 5 years isn't that long but the guy wants to win while he's still young.
NewYorkSportsLife19::Yes, and he would be better than Milsap but honestly I think you guys would have a better chance getting Milsap though which would still be great. If Love leaves the Timberwolves because of there low-succees since he's been in town, I think he would go to a contender team (even though he could easily make the Rockets a contender).  What do you think?
NguyenDragon::I am just dreaming with the latest news about Love feeling unappreciated in Minnesota... Rockets still have a 4 year max contract to offer him... We do have young talents and our own pick up for trade...
NewYorkSportsLife19::Yeah bro or even Millsap who is also most likely gonna be traded this year. They would both be perfect for the Rockets who desperately need a great PF
NewYorkSportsLife19::Nguyen I just read your earlier comment and I could not agree with you more bro. Lin should be playing the role that Harden played on OKC and play off the bench. The problem is, Harden plays like 37-38 minutes a night so Lin wouldnt have much time at all to run his team on his own so I think he just needs to stop being so passive when Harden is in
Kobah-Bryne::Say what you want about KG, but the dude is loyal and passionate. That moment between  he and McHale after the game gives me the chills.
NewYorkSportsLife19::What happened?
NewYorkSportsLife19::Okey thanks dude
NguyenDragon::NewYorkSportsLife19 - I know but what happened with KG?  It was one of those moments you just have to see... A very classy move by KG... There is a video link on the Twitter feed...
NguyenDragon::NewYorkSportsLife19 - I know but what happened with KG?  It was just a very classy move by KG...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=9pgvpyHdIlA#!
NewYorkSportsLife19::I know but what happened with KG?
NguyenDragon::Coach McHale's daughter just died recently...
rma5690::I watched the game in full. Lin doesn't even try to initiate plays half the time. Harden even makes it easier for Lin by dribbling the ball up the court, then giving it to Lin to run a play, only for for Lin to hand it right back.
NguyenDragon::Lin becomes very passive when Harden is on the court... Whatever his deal is he needs to get over it... Take command of the team like a PG should or take a seat... That being said McHale is way over his head trying to coach this team...
NewYorkSportsLife19::Very true, I agree with both of you. He looks great when Harden isn't in but that very rarely even happens.
NoonGame::Coach Mchale is a moron. He is not using Lin properly...The best passer on the team should be out there passing/playing and not sit on the bench...
NguyenDragon::Lin might need to come off the bench and play the role Harden did in OKC... Its obvious that Lin's game does not mesh well with Harden...
NewYorkSportsLife19::Lin only plays well when he is the main guy. When Harden is out he plays better but the Rockets lose. Douglas is the better scorer, period. As long as Lin struggles to score while Douglas has good nights scoring, Douglas will continue getting his 20+ mins. Point guards main job is running the offense but they hafto score and Lin cant even get 8 points or more unless he plays 32-34 mins. Besides that Spurs game, do the research for yourself and your see. Douglas is the better scorer, Lin is the better passer.
NewYorkSportsLife19::Dude, it's Because Douglas actually scores. Lin still gets more mins then Douglas does so you should be happy but Douglas however, still scores more then Lin in less time. He wants more scoring to come from the point guard position and that's why he will continue to give Douglas 20-25 minutes and that's how they win games so who cares? You just wanna watch Lin, thats all you care about so dont dcare McHale "dumb" for caring about the teams success and not Lins.
kita2porgee::Dear JLin,  Last time I called you chicken and a coward, the next day and without Greedy T.O. Harden, you dump 38 pts &amp; almost beat one of the Best defensive team, for that matter, maybe the best team along with OKC. Actually Mchale screwed up twice. Once in the first half when you/Lin got hot, in fact after a 3ptr and leading by 11 or more, Mc took out Lin. Again in the 2nd half he did the same thing. By the time he rushed Lin in late, the momentum had switched over to the best team, best coach of the NBA. What are the chances?  Clyde and his co-announcer said it best. "THE MIND SET". When Harden got back and started shooting and turning the ball over, the Linsanity is gone again. JLin must look how he played. No hesitation, his dribbling was faster, his agressiveness was like in NY. So if JLIN is going to be passive, maybe it is best JLIN, you should be BENCHED. You are getting paid but the Rockets are not getting their fair share. Am I being mean to you? You should have gone to Chicago or the Spurs for these COACHES will make you better and yeah, be mean to you, Like what POP did to Parker. The coaches you have there in Houston are very bad for you. ISO will never make it, without moving the ball like what you did with the Knicks and vs. the Spurs.  Granted the coaches are not that smart, but You must assert your self or your assssset will be glued on the bench. I being Asian, love to see you excel and represents us. But it is agonizing to see you being passive, timid, and gets insulted by Asian haters like JBarry of ESPN and high school drop outs here. You obviously have the talent. Even when Spurs made you go to your left, but the adrenaLIN was pumping already.  JLIN, they kept on saying you are over rated, can't play in the NBA. Well, vs. Lakers 38pts vs Mavs/Champs 29pts, and Spurs 38pts. These 3 are top defensively. I know you can, but being passive, a pushover makes us Asians sick. Read the Old Testament. You being humble is OK. But to play to be passive and Humble does NOT WORK IN ANY PHYSICAL COMPETITION. Yeah, maybe just QUIT and be a preacher and save us Asians to be depressed seeing you not use your God given talent.
Stanley5826::Give the players time to gel. Be patient. Time will heal all things. After all, Lin is only 24.
NoonGame::it's really not his fault when his idiot coach not letting his starting pg play in the 4th...the best passer on the team is not out there passing the ball instead he sits on the bench...and yes lin need to be more aggressive when he does have a chance to play...
NewYorkSportsLife19::Besides they win games that way so who cares? You just wanna watch Lin play, thats all, you clearly dont care about the Rockets
NewYorkSportsLife19::Because Douglas actually scores man. He still gets more mins then Douglas does so you should be happy but Douglas however, still scores more then Lin in less time. He wants more scoring to come from the point guard position and thats why he will continue to give Douglas 20-25 minutes
SBaller74::This is beyond sad... The fact that someone took the time to write all that mess and the fact that I read it smh
NewYorkSportsLife19::Dude, the guy loves basketball and I thought it was a good and truthful read. Your clearly the sad and pathetic one Sballer
kita2porgee::YOU SBALLER must be a high school drop out. Can you really read? In fact it was for Lin, not someone like you who does not have any...brains.
kita2porgee::Love the Celts as they beat the Lakers in '08. Originally from L.A. love their battle with the MJohnson vs Bird. Real Teams, Real fighters. Smart players. Those days are gone with ISO.
_I Am A Celtic_::This is just sad
NewYorkSportsLife19::He actually did very good moron
nhraven52::Lin dominates Rondo Celtics get slapped back to reality
NewYorkSportsLife19::I hope that was you who liked your own comment so we can only be blessed with 1 idiot in here instead of 2
NewYorkSportsLife19::lol Lin did what? HE DID WHAT?!?!?!?! HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAA
NewYorkSportsLife19::@Esdgf, Coach is going to continue giving Douglas more time then he used to because he wants more scoring to come from the pg position and Lin really doesnt score points as well as Douglas. Douglas had more than double the amount of pts than Lin in less time played. So yeah hes going to give Lin more mins a game but still going to give douglas decent mins to get his 10-12 points that he always gets
esgdf::I want to know what led machale to believe the team was better off with Lin on the bench.
NewYorkSportsLife19::look, Lin does good starting when the main guys are not playing, he does good but the Rockets dont. When Harden is the Main guy they win and yesterday they won so who cares?
Dawan208::I disagree with benching Lin.  Even though Lin just needs to showcase his talents which is the pic and roll.  He's not good at the spot up shooting!   Remember teams got slaughtered when he got on a pic and roll frenzy ..   Celtics were ready for him-- double teaming him!!!   When Tyson Chandler and him pic and roll last year they were both dangerous.   Lin would pic and Chandler would roll for an alley opp.
showmeproof::People still up? Get over it. Rockets rule!
dog_has_fleas::A .500 team rules? Really?
dog_has_fleas::Im just curious how a guy that gets 6 a game goes for twenty against what is supposed to be a good defensive team,
UndeniableTruthTeller::Alright, nice talking to you guys. I'm out. Peace.
tq01wnf::good night or good morning. Have a good day.
tq01wnf::bye. Have a good day.
Dawan208::I didn't mean to run everyone away!!!  Bye!
Dawan208::Thanks for your insight even though I disagree!   And I agree harden and Chandler are a nice backcourt!!!!:)
UndeniableTruthTeller::Lets not talk about the overhyped Jeremy Lin, and lets focus our attention on James Harden, who you can say is the primary reason Houston is at .500 right now. Him and Chandler Parsons have played really well this season. Houston's got a bright future in the 2.
esgdf::Mchale is just a dumb coach and this is why Lowry wanted nothing to do with that $@%!$@%.
Dawan208::Undeniabletruthteller what about when he put up 38 points against the spurs the other night.  Give him a chance it's still early.  You have to admit he has good court vision and can dish it to the open man .  I thought that's what point guards do!!!!!
tq01wnf::somehow who knows the future. I like houston. I hope it could be better.
Dawan208::I can only say he needs to be more aggressive and be the point guard that he is a true pic and roll pg.  he's at his best doing that.  I wish they set plays for him.    I thought that was McHale's game plan-  I was wrong!
tq01wnf::especially now its all-star vote.
tq01wnf::Dawan208 - Undeniabletruthteller what about when he put up 38 points against the spurs the other night.  Give him a chance it's still early.  You have to admit he has good court vision and can dish it to the open man .  I thought that's what point guards do!!!!!  compare to NY last year, he needs more outstanding performance for the 25 millions.
UndeniableTruthTeller::He's shooting 39% on only 10 shots per game. That is just awful! Also, I would like to see a bit production from him. 6 assists per game is not going to cut it.
Dawan208::I think he needs to be more aggressive, yes protect the ball but he needs to shoot more wouldn't you say then his stats would look better!
UndeniableTruthTeller::He was due to have a breakout game. He was stuggling all month long and needed something to get him out of his slump. I still don't believe he's the answer to the Rockets problems.
tq01wnf::Lin may get lost or he may get through this.  But he isnt huston's future. Anyway goodluck for him.
UndeniableTruthTeller::I'm a good guy too, but that doesn't mean the Rockets should be paying me 25 million dollars to shoot 39% on the season.
tq01wnf::UndeniableTruthTeller - After his contract is up, he'll be out of Houston. He's definitely not the future.  He is a good guy.  But houston needs more.
UndeniableTruthTeller::After his contract is up, he'll be out of Houston. He's definitely not the future.
tq01wnf::hope other superstars come to huston.  It s rarely possible.
tq01wnf::UndeniableTruthTeller - I think Houston is a player away from becoming a legit playoff contender.  Because of Morey...I've disappointed for years.
UndeniableTruthTeller::I think Houston is a player away from becoming a legit playoff contender.
tq01wnf::James Harden would have a great future. Huston too.
UndeniableTruthTeller::Yep. Harden and Parsons both have great futures in Houston.
YaImFromCleveland::People don't like Lin cause there's actually other fans that are interested in his game play and development.  You're mad because other people's attention aren't aligned with yours when it comes to basketball entertainment? Go cry about it.
jamessss41::and now the reason he's being marginalized is because he's not black
YaImFromCleveland::"The ONLY reason why Lin has gained all this popularity is because he is asian."  How is that not racist.  Do you know the meaning of racism?
UndeniableTruthTeller::I have not said one racist thing so far, yet you've thrown the racist card at me at least 3 times already. This is a free country, and I should be able to call somebody an asian without being labeled a racist.
YaImFromCleveland::What's worst than your racist comment is your cowardliness in approaching racism.  If you're going to be racist dude, go and be racist.  Don't back track on your racism
UndeniableTruthTeller::http://sports.yahoo.com/news/lebron-kobe-lead-lin-lurking-013720277--nba.html  <b>"Lin, an Asian-American who became a worldwide phenom last season while playing for the New York Knicks, has struggled in his first season with the Rockets but remains popular in Asia and figures to benefit from this being the first time fans can vote via social media". </b>
YaImFromCleveland::You can call him Asian, Chinese, Taiwanese, American, that's not racist.  But you are making a radical assumption that the ONLY reason he's getting attention and the ONLY reason he's worth anything in the NBA is because he's Asian.  That's racist.  How is this not sinking in?
UndeniableTruthTeller::I can't call somebody asian without being hit with the racist card? Jeez, you Clevelanders need to get out more. Yes, Jeremy Lin being asian is the sole reason why he's gained so much popularity and is ahead of Westbrook in votes for the all-star game. I'm not being racist, just stating basic logic here.
UndeniableTruthTeller::Wrong actually. I could care less about Lin, but I could understand a fan's frustration when ESPN overhypes a point guard that shoots 39% and puts up just 11 points, yet is made out to be a superstar. How the fu*k does Jeremy Lin have more votes for the allstar game than Westbrook?
UndeniableTruthTeller::Wrong actually. The ONLY reason why Lin has gained all this popularity is because he is asian. Why do you think he's at the top of the voting polls? Because he's got a large fanbase over in asia. If this was an african-american who puts up 10 points and shoots 39%, he'd be coming off the bench and his name would have never been mentioned on ESPN. So don't throw the racist card at me.
YaImFromCleveland::So you're mad about the NBA, then leave it that way.  There's a pattern where fans are upset with the all star voting process, don't know how to express themselves, so they channel their hatred and racism towards Lin and their fans.  Don't hate the player, hate the game.  Get it right.
kudjer1::I know many people hate KG but man what he did at the end of the game tonight was a class act. Props KG
JustPlayBall1234::Didn't watch game.  Why was Jeremy Lin benched?
GeorgeTownDC29::Mchale wanted to win the game and realized Lin wasnt doing crap
YaImFromCleveland::a hater who obviously didn't watch the game.  rather watched the espn highlights and decided it was enough to warrant his hatred towards lin.

whatsdoing::would you start tony douglas over lin?
Tuoi56::Delfino better than LIn? time for your medicine.
Heritage Champion::Yes, it's preposterous that Lin is even being considered for the AllStar game when he isn't even the 3rd or 4th best player on his current team. Delfino, Parsons and Douglas are all better than Lin... I hope that he continues to solidify his game but I'm sick of the Lin-sanity crap.
howo357::Heritage Champion - Delfino, Parsons and Douglas are all better than Lin... I hope that he continues to solidify his game but I'm sick of the Lin-sanity crap.  LMAO. that made my day especially Delfino.

brunick1::Still a better record than the Lakers lol
AlphaBeta123::that's not saying much this year lol
LetsGoBraves2012::Kevin Garnett versus Brook Lopez  The rumors of Kevin Garnett's demise have been slightly exaggerated. He may be a step slower and can't get his own shot quite as easily, but Garnett's overall drop-off the past several seasons has been slight. He's one of only two 36-year-olds in the past five years to average at least 15.9 points and 7.4 rebounds per game. Plus, he's still an effective presence on defense.  But the lumbering Lopez is a formidable adversary who can create problems for Garnett. With outstanding size (7-foot, 265 pounds) and length, the fifth-year Net is a skilled space eater who's more crafty around the basket than given credit for. Thanks to his overachiever rep and absence of Dwight Howard-like athletic ability, it's easy to dismiss Lopez as a system beneficiary. But there's no denying his production: Lopez is the only player in the league averaging 19 points and 2.5 blocks while shooting 55 percent from the field. On Nov. 26 against the Knicks, he turned in his best game of the season going for 22 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks. The last time Garnett registered a line like that was March 10, 2007, a year before Lopez was drafted.  [+] EnlargeKevin Garnett Jim McIsaac/Getty ImagesKG can still compete at a high level at age 36.  Not only does Lopez have excellent touch around the paint -- he drops in 42 percent of his short floaters from the nonrestricted area -- but he can shoot his soft little push shot from a catch-and-shoot position or as a trailer in transition. In wins, Lopez is averaging 20.3 points and 3.0 blocks. In losses, he's registering 16.5 points and 1.5 blocks per game. In those games he has tended to drift too far from the basket and unsuccessfully tried to create with the dribble.  Garnett's once-mighty offensive game has been transitioning over the past several years into one that relies heavily on the 17-foot jump shot, which he's become one of the best at knocking down (52 percent of Garnett's shot attempts are midrange jumpers). Garnett has made an all-defensive team 12 times in his likely Hall of Fame career and is far more effective than Lopez when guarding opponents away from the basket, which has become a necessity in today's small-ball era. His ability to help and rotate across the lane is still at a level Lopez may never achieve.  Lopez has always been a below-average rebounder due to sluggish feet and awkward fundamentals under the boards. When it comes to boxing out, coaches like to say that the lowest man wins. This can be a problem for Lopez since he doesn't get very low and, despite his size, can be pushed off his spot rather easily. Despite being 12 years older and grabbing caroms at a rate way below his career average, Garnett is still the superior rebounder.  But Lopez is gaining ground defensively as he develops as a quality shot-blocker. He's fourth in the league with 2.7 blocks per game and has shown impressive defensive patience. In one sequence late in the Nov. 26 Knicks-Nets game, Lopez blocked or changed Carmelo Anthony's shot attempt at close range three times in one possession.  Still, Garnett's versatility and savvy gives him the edge.  Advantage: Garnett  Who's the better tandem?  The NBA has evolved into a pick-and-roll league, and a duo's effectiveness at running this bread-and-butter play -- as well as stopping it -- can be the mark of how well the tandem works together. In the Nets' pick-and-roll, Lopez has a habit of not actually setting the pick, but rather showing then simply turning to roll toward the basket. That's partly out of necessity, because Lopez drawing contact 25 feet out then rolling to the basket would take far too long to develop to yield any quality results. Lopez's "phantom picks" don't require defenders to switch when he rolls (so he's still guarded by a big) on his pick-and-roll shot attempts. The result? His 0.786 points per possession ranks in the bottom 18 percent of the league.  Surprisingly, Williams and Lopez, often maligned for their defense, rate better than perennial all-defense duo Rondo and Garnett in stopping the pick-and-roll. Williams is one of the best in defending the pick-and-roll ball handler, holding him to 0.651 points per possession on 23.7 percent shooting compared to Rondo's 0.716 ppp on 39.6 percent.  That gap in effectiveness between Lopez and Garnett in defending the pick-and-roll is even greater. When Lopez guards the rolling big, he allows 0.762 ppp on 36 percent shooting to Garnett's 1.167 ppp on 46.2 percent from the field.  But as far as top-flight duos go, Williams and Lopez simply haven't logged many games together (just 16 games heading into this season). However, they appear to be coming together even in limited action. The Nets have several plays where Lopez flashes in the middle and receives a quick pass from Williams to get off a short shot. Lopez also has become very effective as a trailer, filling the lane on the break. Williams has helped exploit this in transition by feeding him below the free throw line, where he can finish without dribbling.  But the Brooklyn duo's chemistry is almost nonexistent compared to the deep (yet sometimes fiery) on-court bond that Rondo and Garnett share. Since the Celtics' 2008 title run, Rondo has transformed himself from unproven link to the record-setting leader of Team Green. And with it comes respect and trust from Garnett, which is at the core of the Celtics' all-for-one approach.  Best duo: Rondo and Garnett
2524thomas::Its all moot because you win as a team and lose as a team..and at the end of the year the final standings will be the Knicks...Nets...Celtics in that order...and i would take Lopez, Williams, Johnson , Humphries and Wallace any day

LetsGoBraves2012::It seems like throughout the NBA, we're seeing a changing of the guard, from upstart teams trying to get a foothold to young players on the brink of making a name. But still there's the ever-present old guard that dots championship contenders throughout the basketball landscape.  The Brooklyn Nets fall somewhere in the middle. With shiny new digs, burgeoning neighborhood pride and an eye on joining the upper echelon, the team in that other borough is on the move. And the players who will likely get them there are inside-out duo Deron Williams and Brook Lopez.  But just how good are they? For a quality measuring stick, look no further than their Atlantic Division foes in Boston. Kevin Garnett and Rajon Rondo make up one of the most effective duos in basketball. However, the Nets appear to be on the rise while the Celtics might be losing steam.  Let's take a look at who's better in this player-by-player and duo breakdown.  Rajon Rondo versus Deron Williams  Two of the NBA's very best have distinctly different styles. Rondo is a more snug fit in the traditional point guard mold, as his primary function is to distribute the basketball. Right now no one is doing that better than the Celtics' speedy floor leader. His 13.7 assists per game are tops in the league, and he's on a historic pace: On Nov. 25, Rondo became the second player in NBA history to notch double figures in assists in 37 consecutive games.  Rondo already has a league-high five games with 15-plus assists in the first month of the season. (The last player to do that? Rondo in 2010.) His combination of large hands, long arms, excellent floor vision and willingness to pass have made him the game's most dangerous setup man. But Rondo doesn't look to score often, attempting just 11.2 shots per game. Plus, his offense can be quite predictable, as nearly 75 percent of his attempts are midrange jumpers or come directly at the rim. On the positive side, he's shooting a career best at the rim (66.1 percent) and from 16 to 23 feet (50 percent).  Williams is and has always been a scorer who happens to be a great setup man. He's one of only four players in history with a 57-point game and a 20-assist game. (Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Rich Guerin are the others.) Though his shot attempts are down a bit and he averages just 3.3 more points that Rondo, Williams can take over a game with his ability to score, while the Celtics have far better offensive options than Rondo. In his career, Williams has nearly four times as many 20-point games as Rondo (192 to 54).  Williams' entire game is predicated on his nearly flawless handle, which he uses to set up scoring opportunities for himself and others. His weapon of choice is his low, sweeping crossover set up by a convincing shoulder fake which frees him to pop the midrange jumper. He's particularly dangerous in transition where his can change direction at speed while keeping his head up to find cutters and shooters. He's also fond of backing down his man at the elbow, getting low and drawing the defense to drop off a slick no-look dish to a big waiting underneath the basket.  A slick passer, yes, but not nearly as giving as Rondo, who generates 29.4 points per game (via passing) to Williams' 16.1. But Williams has the advantage overall in career head-to-head matchups against Rondo with 16.3 points, 9.3 assists and 3.3 rebounds to Rondo's 9.8/8.1/3.7 career numbers against D-Will.  Advantage: Williams
