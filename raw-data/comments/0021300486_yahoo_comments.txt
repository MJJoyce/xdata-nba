Cyril::Looks like Griffin has been working on his free-throw shooting.  He shot 77% from the foul line last month and is just a couple of free throws away from 70% for the season.  In the last 10 games, he has had four games where he shot 10 or more foul shots and made at least 80% of them.  Teams can't hack him at the end of games anymore.   His spot-up shooting has also improved dramatically, but he still can't shoot off the dribble to save his life. His defense is still a long way from where it needs to be too.
HIP2CLIP::That was such a great win for the Clippers last night. Sad to see CP3 go down but he'll be fine. Mavs fans were despondent after the game
Nozidwerd::This is definitely a breakout season for Deandre Jordan. Together with Griffin, they make a rebounding machine duo. I mill miss seeing Paul's double figure assist stats for quite some time.
Steven McCormick::I'm really not worried about this game . . . but I f were Dpc . . . I'd keep these 5 guys out on the floor for the duration of the quarter.
Clipperdude::DJ leads the league in fg%, 5th in blocks and i think just took over the rebounding lead from K Love. Yeah we should get rid of that!
Clipperdude::DJ did great, where is that idiot who wanted to trade him? 25 points on 14 shots, 3 blocks, 18 boards any team would love that.
Fugly::Who loves my commercials?
Kobe For 3.....Clank!::Lakers may actually break that losing streak tonight.  That powerful schedule of teams they have played during the last week is finally coming around.
Rodney::Great game my DJ.  Collison really picked up the slack too.  That's team bball.
Hair Club Dooley::What's happening
