Matt::I may get some thumbs down for this, but even though he had a triple double, Wall is the reason that Washington lost this game.  9-29 is inexcusable.  It's like bashing your head against the wall 29 times and thinking that you're still going to break through it somehow.  When you're shooting that bad, you've got to be smart enough to realize at some point that you're hurting your team's chance to win by continuing to shoot, particularly in a close game like this.
brian::They could have fouled Gerald Wallace intentionally. He's a horrible FT shooter
GmanJoe::Green is one of the keys for Boston's rebuilding.  Great game.
John::Celtics still making too many turnover's. Wallace play some good ball at the end.
scotty::This doesn't help our draft position.  When is Rondo going on the block?
GraceO::How is it possible for John Wall to be a player of the game for Washington? He was lousy, at best.
Amir::Nice comeback, Booker is my man i love him.
da bomb::I seriously can't believe they blew this one too. Really.
Mark::Has Faverani's performance suffered such a setback that the coach considers d league players to be better?
Mark::I am sure the media will be happy  with Jeff Green 's performance.  How good was Oscar Robertson in his day when he averaged a triple double throughout the season.
