LaMar::What i enjoy about the spurs most off is that they are a team made up of team work. its not just one sided game play like alot of other teams in the league who rely on a super star to win the game. hell it could boris who had a good game and tim would sit down to let him do his thing. will they win a championship who knows. Tired of hearing that they are to old but they out play alot of the younger talented players year after year. So Go Spurs
Alexis::Bring Jason Kapono to Phoenix Sun you need a legitimate 3 point shooter with high percentage also his free throw shooting is high.. Last time  I heard about Kapono he was playing in Europe you will get him sign for pennies  it is always good to have an specialist on the team I never though Phoenix was going to play and compete this well good luck for the rest of the season.
MJ::Finally, Danny Green shows up... First of the many! Go SPURS Go!!!
Uncle Dunk::Phoenix has been showing above the expectation - to loose with this narrow margin is showing the sign of good team with no big star names attached to them. The score is well spread and they still have some extra weapon with Okafor still not coming from the injury list.
Golden Groin::Frye should not be starting, he is a off the bench 3 point shooter. True they dont have many options with injuries but he is a SG in a C clothing at best. Is a good asset to a team but not as center
gary strong::Phoenix is playing VERY well right now! Keep in mind they have Len, Dragic, and Okefor on their bench today. This lineup can beat quite a few teams on an given night if properly coached. They may get a get a 6-8 seed in the West this year, especially if Kobe sits out past December. I am impressed
DuddyBoyStar::MILES PLUMLEE!!!
Gorkem::Tony Parker is a genious
Javy::What is wrong with Kawhi?
david b::Leonard is a pf
