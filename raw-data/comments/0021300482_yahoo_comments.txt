46064::Toronto is playing very good defense during this streak also. They are focused on both ends of the court.
Cate::Until Washngton gets rid of their D league coach and their know nothing general manager nothing is going to change...period.
Rich::Joey Crawford needs the glue factory.  Retire already.  He misses so may calls its not funny anymore.
RAY B::Believe Raptors are 9-3 since the Rudy Gay trade. 2 losses to the Spurs and one last second OT loss to Charlotte. Regardless of whom they have played,,9-3 is impressive. That 3-1 road trip was their first 3-1 road trip in years..
Richard L::This is awesome basketball, the way the Raptors are playing. 29 assists. If you do not call that a great team work, I don't know what is. Good to see DeRozan sharing the ball now.
bgood2life::Point Guard Kyle Lowry,played some woowe defense on Point guard John Wall,on his home court.
TedS::Vasquez wasting away on the bench........so silly!! You have to find minutes for this guy or move him. He's way too good to be sitting on an NBA bench!! Ridiculous
Commenter::mayor is on crack but raptors win with no crack
JAY::Rudy Gay is a self ego Maniac. Just Like Andrea Bargnani. Good Riddance. Will win the Atlantic Division.
Paul G::Jonas is not getting any better. 5 more minutes a game and just 2 more points a game and a couple of rebounds. Is time running out on this guy? They said they wont trade him but for someone who is 7foot and only grabbing 8 rebounds a game, that is alarming to me.
