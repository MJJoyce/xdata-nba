ZykO::solid win but let's not get too carried away. 21 turnovers is still way too much and this continues to be major issue and why the warriors can't be considered an elite contender. furthermore, the suns are really overachieving and aren't really more than a .500 team that got hot for a minute. warriors still need to get a better handle on the ball.
Stumpy::Great D last night and great win..  The Clipper game was not the Warriors we know and I'm sure Griffin was talking all kinds of #$%$ but last night shows who the Warriors are with this new ownership.
Django::Suns stinking up the joint tonight, x-mas hangover. Warriors looking sharp, put in the bench on to the next one.
Django::Always a must see game when the Suns and Warriors are playing each other.
PKM::Big division game.  If Curry takes care of the ball the Warriors should be good.
Ray::Warriors need to beat this pathetic team by 20 plus points.
Anton::Holiday hangover. Suns were in a giving mood but we all know they are superior to the Warriors.
Scott::Bad shooting night for Curry, but he made up for it with the rest of his game.  Nice triple double and +27.
Vlad::this suns box score is weird. so many guys scoring above 5 pts but less than 10 pts. i dont remember seeing something like that in an nba game
Seattle Blows!::dubs and sharks won today!
