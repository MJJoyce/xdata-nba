64993366::Suns no super stars, well distributed in number of shoots, 14, 14, 12, 13, 10, 8 and 7, and anyone can score tons of points on any given night. Opposing teams will have hard time setting up defense. Nice team play, and nice coaching, Honey.
Bjetlog17::Hey Mark! George Karl is still available!!
Flame::6'7" DeJuan Blair has 0 rebounds and 0 blocks in 11 minutes. Why again is he still starting at center over 6'11" Brandan Wright (5 boards, 4 blocks)?
Bjetlog17::And the Mavs comedian coach is talking about his playoff strategy this season 3 days ago.
bertoTubero::Gerald green is killing me in fantasy.. Ugghhh :(
Teh::Same ole Channing Frye. Hits a few 3s and then sits on the bench for the rest of the game.
clint::Bledsoe makes the coach look good or is it vice versa? the suns first time coach, looks better than several other recent first time coaches. Plumlee is not flashy but sound.
Barry::Love this Suns team.  When the bench comes in nothing is lost.
George::The Mavs play defense as well as the Cowboys.
Flydog::someone needs to tell the Mavs they have a midget at the center position
