Ryan Staton::Naters gonna Nate
Nick Nagel::Everyone keeps over looking Nate Wolters!  He is way better than Brandon Knight.  The Bucks will go farther with him than Knight!
Trevor I-Excel Gunn::Monta will go off tonight against his former team and outshine Mayo who will also be looking to prove something. Mavs 108-95
Guy Mann::Mavs got sloppy, but hung on.  Really some ugly basketball played out there tonight.
Chris Weissel::been really bad in most 3rd quarters this season... turnovers are killing us
Max Klein::Looks like not much has changed for OJ in the offseason. 2 assists 0 steals/blocks  to 6 turnovers 5 fouls. I don't care if he scored 28 points those are not good. Ellis is a big improvement.
Tony Ellis::What's the deal with Larry Sanders? Was he a flash in the pan who is too much of a hothead to sustain his dominance as a post defender, or is this just a minor blip on the radar?
Nicholas Duke Falldine::does this game start at 7:30 or 8:30 dallas time? Dish Network says 8:30 and Espn says 7:30...
Josh Jordan::Please win a road game tonight Mavs. Tired of losing on the road and I dang sure don't wanna lose to Mayo
Guy Mann::Huge second half choke job under way...C'mon Dallas.  Wake the hell up.
Tanner Fink::I need to know that for my draftkings matchup as well???
Adriano Wind::11 comments while the Celtics have over 500. Wow
Richard F Gadwood::cause dallas fans have a life and dont stay home on a saturday night
Ilias Gavriiloglou::is knigh or irlasova playing
