DONALD N::Well deserved loss because of Rose's refusal to move the ball to Dunleavy on the open wing.  Time after time Rose never looked towards Dunleavy, but instead forced the ball to players that were covered. The Denver players took advantage of Rose's selfish play.
Donald::At halftime I figured if the Nuggets don't keep the Bulls of the  glass during the game the Nuggets probably would not win.  But six players in double figures won the game for them.
Ronald::Baby bulls getting decapitated.
Commenter::another night shooting
Nad Drawde::What happen to Bulls?? Sucks! D Rose and company will make a better way to improve the team.
willie::Raging bull....with no horns.
fup duck::Chandler looks high
droog::Rose was a -19 in the +/-  category. He gave himself all "A's." What a joke.
J::Gee, Noah needs a break.
Dijion::i wish derrick rose would start playing  like he was at first in steed of being scared he might get injured again
