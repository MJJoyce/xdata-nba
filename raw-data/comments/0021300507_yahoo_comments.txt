Teams stink::Orlando is THE sewer team.  It's amazing they are even in the nba.  They are absolutely horrible.  They need to wipe out the entire team and management and even get a new owner.  Start over with, first, an owner that wants to win and will put out the money to get good players and get scouts that can find that top talent and a coach that will motivate and steer the team at a top level.
Steven McCormick::The sign of a championship team is one where the team can WIN without it's superstar.  There is no doubt that the Clippers will miss the versatile skills of  point guard 110 CP3 over the next 6 weeks . . . however,
Lesh::Just kick every one in the Magic Team out. They aren't committed to play. They are purposely making themselves losers.
Cyril::The last time these two teams played, Vucevic lit them up for 30 points and 21 rebounds. Orlando is really missing the big guy right now.
PKM::Trade everybody.
Clipperdude::Clippers hopefully will step up tonight. The played one good half against a great team, If they start the game with that energy they should be fine tonight. Let's go Clippers!
Ray::I bet T Sterling must be mad like crazy about trading Bladsoe. Who's brilliant ideas was to trade Drew?
creep::Nothing was expected of the Lakers this year. The highly touted Clippers are going to take a nosedive big time. How embarrassing that will be for Clapper nation. After all that arrogance and bragging. Can't wait for the meltdown.
Isaac M::Lottery pick. Just focus on the lottery pick.
sitonmyfacebook::nice to see another pair of UCLA guards going at each other (collison vs. afflalo)
