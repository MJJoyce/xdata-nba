Vincent::Something has to change here this team is basically healthy now and they stink each night especially against bad teams. They are truly pissin me off. They are so lucky that the East stinks for now.
Rico M::The bad part about all of this is that teams in the East will likely make the playoffs without even trying.. So its probably gonna get worse before it gets better trying to be the worst team altogether and landing a high pick in the draft.
CSONKA_39::Bulls have to be the biggest disappointment this year, Rose or no Rose.
Amir::Raptors look very good now when actually their front-court are allowed to touch the balls not only after offensive board.With Gay that wasn't possible.
Carter::Chicago is eerily quiet tonight...
Aktion Pak::bulls only play good against miami even without rose; garbage raptors blown them away in their own building and they have the same record now bulls are now garbage as well good luck to lottery and amnesty injury prone self proclaimed best player in the league derrick softer than a rose
Puck Hawk'N::Chicago has LA on their minds , can not put enough brain power into this game , see em get a smackdown tonight , then beat LA 5 - 1 and chase Quick in the 2nd period tomorrow.  These games are like reruns , they just can't multi task against a lesser team when a #1 , 2 or 3 team awaits in the wings tomorrow.
maximo::jonas get hurt? or casey is crazy?
Commenter::26-11 in the 4th... sure glad I missed that!!!
tara::time to amnesty someone, carlos boozer has played so terrible this year, no post D what so ever.
