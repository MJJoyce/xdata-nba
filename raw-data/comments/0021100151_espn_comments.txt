pmd49er::All the talking heads on ESPN are hopping on the bandwagon.....like all of a sudden Kobe is the best player in the league. He has been the best for years now, thanks for catching up...
Bodey007::Jazz suck.
Khi_in9CoGi49::haha. FISHER +14, KOBE +10...and they both got 5 rings. i guess FISH is betta than KOBe
eightbitme::I guess you're reading a bit too much into the plus and minus stat.
nunya2414::Hey Pubert.McLoser:  "Lakers center Andrew Bynum, who is averaging 17.1 points and 13.9 rebounds this season, appears to be a lock to make and start his first All-Star Game, garnering 496,597 votes"
Zonker40::Well his only competition is a guy in Memphis who is doing nothing but struggling right now... and Tim Duncan since he often ends up as a center for some stupid reason on the ballot.
Zonker40::So here's some of the real math on Kobe's last two games... we know he was 32 of 62 but he was also 23 of 24 on free throws.  Two free throws taken are the equivalent of a shot and two makes are the equivalent of a made shot... therefore we can add another 11.5/12 to his numbers... that comes out to 43.5/74 which is 58.8%.  Threes also effect things slightly since 1/3 made is the same as 1/2 on regular shots but people not purposely hating on Kobe get that...
twentyanite::i disagree. ask me this again by the trade deadline. help is on the way.
mrjrob1313::Dont care, Dont care. He is on his down slope. Still great, still making baskets, but lakers wont see another championship in the kobe era.
mrjrob1313::Dont care, Dont care. He is on his down slope. Still great, still making baskets, but lakers wont see another championship in the kobe era.
mrjrob1313::Yes hating, but just stating the facts. Um...no recolition of not winning without shaq. Both had their moments. But, as the game goes on....need to pass, not a YODA but see this franchis crumbling soon!!!
Zonker40::Yeah yeah, haters like you have been saying that for years... remember when all the idiots claimed he had no chance to ever win without Shaq?
twentyanite::kobe is easily the best scorer the game has ever seen since mike. he scores in every way the game allows you to score. even at 16 years in because of his incredible conditioning and fundamentals he is still getting 30 a clip. no question who the best player is.  AND STILL...........
twentyanite::nah frank. but i am eyeing starting a new dynasty. how are things down at the river walk these days???
sharar09::^if that's the best insult you can come up with, i'll take it
FrankPistachio211::You still eyeing that 3-Peat, chump?
Roy-Williams::at least he won one... lebron is eyeing that first ring
Zonker40::At least it's nice to win two in a row every now and then...
JacobJcn31::Kobe NBA's leading scorer!!!! Letssssss gooooo!!!
rajdi@att.net::do you guys think that kobe missed the last jumper to win the game on purpose so he can get more points?
Khi_in9CoGi49::totally. hater
sharar09::haters hate. kobe's ballin.
mrjrob1313::Sorry...but F*** Kobe. Yes, one of the greatest b-ball players in history. Will give my props as a JAZZ fan. But seriously NBA, great players get all foul calls regardles.....come on. Plus stop whinning about every missed called #2, you get every ticky-tack call ever. Wish Raja Bell would have knocked you whinney $@% out!!!!!!!!
Qzhoopin72::Woulda, coulda, shoulda....that's folks always say!!!
mrjrob1313::Read the message...didnt say he was a tough guy. Just would have loved to see it happen.
Jeronimo5::Yeah...cause Raja is such a tough guy.
Ball-aholic::Real Talk. The Lakers will get bounced in the first round. Bynum &amp; Gasoft will eventually get tired of being part of the clean up crew. When you account for fouls, Kobe is averaging 40 shot attempts per game. Even the most passive player will get tired of that. Look for a couple of disengaged &amp; frustrated players coming soon..
ajansan::They won't be around in the first round they'll be traded
rajdi@att.net::first of all, kobe is avering 27 shots a game, 30.3 a game, second, theyre wining the playoffs , nba west con finals, west finals and finals against the heat. kobe is on a hot sreak right know, look for them to be up there in top 2 seeds battling with okc for the top seed

TreODU1993::Lol yeah through 12 games that means soooo much
pmd49er::Sorry haters but old $@% Kobe is STILL the best player in the league....nice choke job by LeBrick again last nite.... I LOVE LA!!!!
joy1652aol::Kobe was 2/6 in 4th quarter and 1/5 in ot...enough said
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::Still?  When has Kobe ever been the best player in the league?  Never.  Kobe is still the same old Kobe.  Inefficient shot chucker extraordinaire.
JacobJcn31::Definition of shot chucker- 5 championships, 1 MVP, 2 finals MVPS and the NBA's leading scorer

Spek_takulore::You guys need to get a life.  Jordan is the all time best.  He did the most with the least.  (See what happened to the bulls during the two years he was gone).  Kobe has skills, but not the killer instinct.  LeBron has even better skills, but no ball smarts or emotional maturity.  He will never be able to prove anything hiding in Miami.
YourRealFather76::And I honestly believe within that last year or so, Kobe has finally began to get his leadership swag going. He's just finally starting to hit a mature age. A same mature mindset of which Jordan grasped later in his career as well. It was around this time that many people finally began giving Jordan his due.  I also don't buy the fact that Kobe is old or done. I think he's just now getting his old man game going. Lots of good basketball still left to come.
YourRealFather76::People said the same thing about Jordan back then as they say now about Kobe. They have very similar set skills. Jordan was a better leader. And could be more aggressive at times. Kobe has more of a pure scorer's mentality. But has "directly" played against much more skilled athletes in today's arsenal of players. Nothing wrong with either one. We should all be lucky to have watched either of these guys play in our lifetime.
Spek_takulore::Who's his supporting super star?  Pippen?  Pippen was nothing without Jordan, well maybe not nothing, but certainly average!  There was no Shaq, no Wade, no Gasul... no where near the talent Kobe has had around him in his championship seasons.  Since LeBron doesn't have any, he doesn't even come into question.
nunya2414::You're an idiot. Pippen &gt; Gasol. Pippen took his team to the Western Conference finals without MJ. Gasol couldn't even win a playoff game on his own
nunya2414::Kobe no killer instinct? LeBron better skills? Lol you don't know jack buddy
nunya2414::Marketable skills? Lmao.. time to clock back in at the gas station huh.. Still laughing at the "Kobe doesn't have killer instinct" comment. Must not watch basketball often.
Spek_takulore::Wow, scathing response with undeniable logic.  Congrats!  But what can I expect on a board like this?  Those of us with marketable skills have to go off lunch break.  Been fun.  BTW  Wikipedia is much more reliable then what your mommy tells you.
nunya2414::you're the one who should do some research little kiddie instead of going by what you read on wikipedia
Spek_takulore::You guys must be a bunch of teenagers who never saw Jordan play.  I'm not a Bulls fan, but Kobe doesn't have near the killer instinct Jordan had.  Kobe's good... don't get me wrong, but we're talking about comparisons.  Do your research, grow up, then tell me what I know.
Steve Blake is a lepricon::"He did the most with the least" you on crack!
