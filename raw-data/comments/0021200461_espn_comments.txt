airic.ad::Monster game from Josh!
Irish12709::Am I on the right message board...
gcburns::Wish Andre Drummond got 36 mins p/game.   In last 11 games, he's averaging 10 rpg in just 23 mpg... which projects to leading league in rebounding.

Sir_Sleepy_Slept::#500 post gets a bl ow job from Kathy Griffin :-)
Lemuel7043::Why are there Den and LAC fans here? too many trolls on your board?
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::really though the Hornets got punked in the 3rd and overall missed a slew of freethrows
mandarae0623::iguodala was better with the 76ers
mandarae0623::76 ers kill the haters tonight

creeddude96@gmail.com::Hawks? Ha! Failcants? Ha! Baseball? Ha!
mandarae0623::keep shooting willie green
Lemuel7043::lolwut?
Rip City Forever::Hey hey pelicans hahah
mandarae0623::say good night nuggets
Lemuel7043::everyone lets go to the NYK board. they just lost to Portland lol
Lemuel7043::I really like our pick Jenkins. I think he's a steal :D
FratBernstein::Threesus!
Jeff7429::scouts said he couldn't dribble....but his all around game is better than advertised.
Lemuel7043::I like it that during the early season he didn't get any playing time, but when he gets a chance, he immediately proves what talent he has.
zdunn1785::and he has great work ethic so who knows what he could turn out to be ray allen or reggie miller is fine by me lol
Lemuel7043::He's more of a catch and shoot. But I think dribbling can improve faster than shooting %
Nargash15::I told people before the draft to remember his name and it was about time. He will be like Ray Allen for the Hawks..!!
Nargash15::Lou Williams 46 min and Teague 41 mins talk about shortening your rotation..!!
Lemuel7043::37 and 40. we don't have Devin harris so there is no back up PG
Nargash15::Yea I know but Teague and Williams feed off each other really well..!!
Nargash15::DAMN IT. I was short by 1 point of my prediction. 9 points isn't bad tho..!!
Jeff7429::I would honestly trade gordon once he gets some numbers under him.....  Trade him for a small forward.
JonathanGeorgeRD::so they can start Rivers? how about not.
MontezATL::Josh Smith is really articulate...
Lemuel7043::Gordon is a ballhog.
dwighthowardsamazing::We were down by 5 kind of making a comeback until we let lemonhead Gordon take over
Lemuel7043::Vasquez is good, I see some Steve Nash in him
Jeff7429::the best  + / -  player you have.
Jeff7429::Smith and Horford totally beat the crap out Davis, Anderson, and Lopez tonight.  Took them to the cleaners.
Lemuel7043::Hawks fans, notice that Larry Drew is a genius in making up plays from a timeout? Most of the time results to an alley-oop.
FSoccer::Oh well, Vasquez was ballin' hard as usual so that's one good thing to take away from this game. GG Hawks.
Jeff7429::by far the most valuable Hornet.  Not even close.
mojart::we need a coach that wins us game.....:)
creeddude96@gmail.com::Moral victories don't exist. Losing does. Losing builds character. We are OKC. We are San Antonio. We are Chicago. We are every team who has went through this process. Lose. Lose. Lose. Then the winning comes. The players get older and more experienced. The hornets will be a great team in a few years. Just watch
TexAugMan::We are getting moral victories!
Jeff7429::If Hawks actually play a real team next game....they will lose.
creeddude96@gmail.com::Dumbas*
Lemuel7043::so OKC, LAC, Memphis, Chicago, Indiana aren't real teams?
hussein623::its clear u dont watch much basketball
Jeff7429::I watch enough to know Smith was actually awake tonight...and he takes some games off.
Lemuel7043::such as?
Lemuel7043::When I watch Eric Gordon, I see so much of Iso Joe Johnson haha. Goodluck with that guy lol
Ben Sheets could be the second half savior for the Braves::Good game Hornets. Screw your football team though
Nodat1::I don't think the Hawks or Falcons are winning a championship anytime soon like the Saints.  Go Hornets and Saints!!!
kennybarrett::Twilight Zone marathon- sic fi channel
hussein623::gg hornets
Jeff7429::I'm sorry but this was a logical spot for a Hornets win tonight....Hawks on a back to back.   You look at the coach when you see this result.
TexAugMan::If Demps continue to justify keeping Monty, Benson need to get rid of him also!
CGraceIII::It's a rebuilding process. Check back in two years.
kennybarrett::Gotcha Ben
