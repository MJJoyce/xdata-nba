Cameron46500::Finally the warriors show their true self. 5 losses in a row is more like the REAL warriors. We all knew they were playing above their heads this year. It's about time they came back down to earth. This is the same team from last year, not the imposters they've been portraying to everyone this year so far.
Grindhouse2413::SMH at GS, do you even want to be in the playoffs cuz I cant tell
tungcn2010::MeloOF, LebronOF, KobeOF &lt; LOF
emthomasjr::Houston's offense is ridiculously potent.
NguyenDragon::This was with a hurt Harden...
Blacks are Inferior and Can only Dunk::Jeremy Lin is no good
setrue::big yawn.....
Nargash35::Warriors are back being lazy on D. This team is really going way down the hill..!!
Aweiy::Why did Lin have a successful run with the Knicks? Chemistry. Go back and watch some Linsanity videos and you will see that everyone was on the same page. It might take a while but when the Rockets start to REALLY click  I think they could be a top 4 team in their conference
Myjohnlai::If you have Tyson Chandler, Steve Novak... to pass to, that makes PG look good.
DuaneXC::Aweiy - Why did Lin have a successful run with the Knicks? Chemistry. Go back and watch some Linsanity videos and you will see that everyone was on the same page. It might take a while but when the Rockets start to REALLY click I think they could be a top 4 team in their conference  I too think they can be a top four team but, I do not believe the team can contend as built.  They're definitely ahead of schedule but, they need a lockdown defender / consistent scoring threat at the 4 and improvement on the defensive side of the ball.
NguyenDragon::Anyone see the new ESPN commercial with Lin?  It would have been funnier if that was SAS...
asian-balla::you must be obsessed with lin uh...
3rdCoastTexan281::I will vouch for NguyenDragon. He is not a LOF, he is a Rockets fan.
NguyenDragon::asian-balla - you must be obsessed with lin uh...  One comment about Lin and I am a Lin lover?... Dumbas.s... Rockets fans that frequent this board often knows I am a Rockets fan first...
setrue::Don't be jealous asian-balla, you want Lin all for yourself?  LOL.
Dawan208::Every time a point guard has a better game than Lin.  People say Lin should not be in the league.      Well Lin had 5 three printers in the last game against the Warriors.  So there!!!    The Warriors lost. And Lin  along with his teammates won that game and this one!!!!
Myjohnlai::Lin is the best open court long passer. He can always pass to a guy in a crowd. That is amazing. He is just like a quarterback in making those long passes.
asian-balla::and you're another lin lover?
DuaneXC::Why all the noise?  He had 14/10 and 0 TO's last night.  He got off to a rocky start for the season but, has improved as it has gone on.  This is not to mention that while he is not a great on the ball defender, he is one of the top thieves in the league.    Is he elite?  Probably not.  But, is he getting better?  Absolutely.
cityhunter4::What happened to Lin trolls boasting that Lin shuts down who he guards?  27 points by Curry shuts down Lin trolls.
eenz3::I watched the whole game and I think curry was 2-11 when he was guarded by Lin (It might not be accurate). His field goals however came when he was guarded by Beverly.
Myjohnlai::Most of the 27 points were scored on Beverly. Lin matched well with Curry.
setrue::Check the scorebroad, did Curry's 27pts win the game for the Warriors?
emthomasjr::That's actually pretty good because Memphis has lock down defense and Curry averages 30+ vs. us (but they still lose).
Dawan208::Wow your life must be miserable.  All you live for is to hate on this kid.  If you are a old man it's pitiful.  I bet you could never play basketball and proably the last kid picked on teams.  So shut up already .  He got a Double Double.    By the way Lin and Beverely guarded Curry idiot!
mspearlmay::If Lin were not asian, he would not be in the NBA.  Curry played him like a school boy which is the level of his skills.
Myjohnlai::Lin's talents were unnoticed because he is an Asian-American. He was offered no college scholarship, undrafted because he is an Asian-American. He is very smart and a quick learner. He is also a team-player. He got 3 fouls early and that was it. He learned how to keep himself away from foul trouble. The average between the last two games tells you Stephen more often than not was frustrated while Lin was guarding him.
Bulls Bears Cubs::I remember last game between those 2 teams, Curry got schooled by Lin, and the whole GS team got schooled by Houston.  Where were you?  Curry not good enough to be in the NBA last game?
Dawan208::You must not be to bright mspearlmay.  Because their would be more ASIANS in the league and he was cut by two and almost three teams last year.  Some people know nothing about bb when they think they do!!!
DuaneXC::...and Curry lost while Lin won...
lomahtw::I thought Lin was born and raised like any other American or even you if you were too.  I am a bit confused.  Isn't he American?
NguyenDragon::There is still a lot of ignorant people around...
bocabenny33433::it's folks like you with your attitude and your fans that make America take a turn for the worst.
Dawan208::There's a name for it it's called "THE UGLY AMERICAN".  It's when americans put the bias attitudes and think they are the supreme race.  Also when we go into their countries and try to change their culture. People like mspearlman is proably black and think that Asians shouldn't be playing.    Well get use to it because their are more and more Asians that are going to be coming to the NBA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bocabenny33433::so any white or black kid that averages 13/14 pts a game and 6/7 assists is just a scrub.  racist pig.
alin004::Lin is the only Cali HS player of the year ever to receive ZERO D1 sports scholarship offers.  Sounds to me like not only are you a r.acist, but you also have it completely backwards. Lin has overcome discrimination at every level to make it.  Kid is only 24 and at worst is already an average NBA starting PG.
HoustonTexan357::Rockets looking good. Harden is putting up Lebron-type numbers
HoboJustice::Really his consistency has been amazing
MunkySnuflz::No turnovers for Lin I guess...
bocabenny33433::you can count ... why so surprised?
bobbydagreat::"I hope Lin leaves this $@%!$@ PG position in Houston where they don't even let their own PG handle the ball every possession."  Me too, I don't dislike Lin, but if it takes him going away to never have to hear from his annoying, ignorant fanbase again, I'd be all for it in a heartbeat.
Myjohnlai::I still think Houston offers a great learning experience for Lin. The rockets run a different offense from the NY offense and yet Lin is coming around and start picking up. At the end, I still thinks he would be the PG that the Lakers need for a championship team. The fans in the Bay area and NY would appreciate Lin more than any other place.
Bulls Bears Cubs::Bobby, you a Lin hater yourself.  You hate his fanbase, but you ignore his haters.  Which means, you do agree with the haters.  There are a lot of Lin haters post here but I dont see you wanting to get rid of this group.
bobbydagreat::You aren't a friend of logic I see. How many Lin "haters" would there be if Lin were gone along with his fanbase? I'm guessing not that many.
Dawan208::Don't read comments then!
NguyenDragon::The sad thing is all these Lin only fans are making people hate the guy they are idolizing...
bocabenny33433::And Houston can be irrelevant and off the radar again .... and no one needs to know that their crap fans barely fill up half the seats for home games.
KeriTheCreoleTexan::I'm sorry, but nobody needs you. The Rockets are one of the most valuable NBA franchises, with or without Lin's fan base.
ofsfan::bobby is a liar.  He claims he doesn't dislike Lin, but is using the fanbase as a scapegoat so he can justify being a hater.
bocabenny33433::bobby is probably some racist redneck.
bobbydagreat::That's just stupid, you must be new.
Lorenzomax7::Why don't you just ignore them?
eenz3::You can blame it on the haters. In my opinion the haters are the ones who are creating fake accounts to act as overzealous Lin fans so the real fans would look bad.
NDFRockets18::Kind of hard to when they flood the game boards.
NDFRockets18::By their logic we should be able to get LeBron for him. I'd pull the trigger on that.
bocabenny33433::Offer accepted, why don't you pay his salary yourself Mr. Moneybags.  What do you do bobbydagreat?  Public assistance specialist?
NDFRockets18::The Hawks got the Nets to take Joe Johnson, maybe we can do the same.
bobbydagreat::To get rid of that stupid fanbase I'd damn near give him away for free and offer to pay his salary.
Vik.::Wherever the Dubs finish, it'll be a success.   I thought they'd win 32 games this year, and they should be able to go at least .500  That's a great improvement over last year.
NDFRockets18::They've taken a huge leap over just last year. Like Houston they were never suppose to be serious playoff teams or contenders but a team of the future. Their best years have yet to come
DuaneXC::NDFRockets18 - Your best player is young and will only get better. There still is this year for you guys. No team in the West is unbeatable in a 7 game series.  Houston has no chance against San Antonio, OKC, or LAC in a 7 game series.  Love the Rockets but, I'd be surprised to not get swept in any of those series...
NDFRockets18::The Spurs bench showed they could compete with the East
bobbydagreat::Yeah because the East is basically the Heat and the Pips. Very little talent in that entire conference, I'd argue that pretty much any playoff team from the West would make the conference finals if they were in the East.
NDFRockets18::The first round in the east is always brutal. They make me want 5 game series in the first round back
bobbydagreat::Gotta love how competitive the West is.
NDFRockets18::Your best player is young and will only get better. There still is this year for you guys. No team in the West is unbeatable in a 7 game series.
Vik.::There's always next year for GSW fans.
Far from it. Faaaaaar from it.::Rockets humiliate the Warriors yet again.
NDFRockets18::I feel like the PG position for Houston has been like the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher position in Harry Potter where they only last a year and then go. Last 5 years we have had Alston then Brooks then Lowry then Dragic and now Lin. Here's hopin Lin can hold up and stick around
Bulls Bears Cubs::I think it is all due to Harden.  He like to have bball in his hand instead of others.  That is just his playing style.
degjoe06::Agree with NDF on the last part. All of them had their best years with the ROX. Where I disagree is Dragic wanted a GUARANTEED 4th year. The ROX wanted team option for 4th year. Same money was offered as what Phoenix gave him.
february1088::I hope Lin leaves this $@%!$@ PG position in Houston where they don't even let their own PG handle the ball every possession. Dont blame the players leaving, blame the system that made all these players leave. There's a reason why they're not sticking around, its unfriendly to PGs and stunts their development because it's a position being told to do much less
NDFRockets18::False. Alston, Brooks and Lowry were traded and Dragic wanted to stay and was vocal about it but Houston didn't want to give him a 4th year on his contract. Fact  Look at the stats, those 4 had their best seasons in Houston then under performed with their next team. I don't believe their development was stunted
Easygoer8964::I stick by the Rockets.  Been a fan ever since Clyde the Glide and Hakeem the Dream!  That's when I started watching the NBA.
NDFRockets18::Yeah it's great to have this team that has direction and a high ceiling as oppose to the team that was a carousel of moving parts that we had going since 09
amak110::Again if Matt Scahub doesn't get us to the super bowl then he's gotta go!!!!
NDFRockets18::I want Kurt Cousins from the Redskins.  Either way, I don't wanna wait another season for Schaub to "prove us wrong"
ScrewedUpTexan713::I thought GSW were gonna come out and put it on the Rockets but they didnt lol
elementz101::houston did to much damage to them in the last game no confidence from GS.
NewcastleFanVL::Rox top scoring team : 106.3/game.
ScrewedUpTexan713::yea after houston put that beat down on them the first time they just fell apart a lil bit kinda like the Texans agains the Bears after Texans won Bears just didnt look like the Bears
NDFRockets18::Yeah the Bears D just collapsed after that game.
setrue::Ultimate bad Karma:  Jeremy Lin &amp; Rockets 4,  GSW and Knicks 0.
Myjohnlai::The last time Houston got him back, they add $24m to his contract. It is very costly to let him go and more costly to have him back.
NDFRockets18::In that case Lin should go to every team for a game and then come back. 82-0 seasons
Tyrone_Sez_Stuff_It::The argument for putting in lin is so he can work thru his mistakes. Sorta like phil jax not calling a timeout during bad stretches, but if they dont  see lin as the future, no sense giving him important 4th quarter minutes
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Well, out of beer. Night gents, GG and see you next time
Easygoer8964::Same here, except I just drunk my last sip of liquor just a minute ago!
NDFRockets18::Take it easy, hopefully you guys get it going again soon. Houston had their 7 game slump in January so I'm sure GS will bounce back quick
tomBabauts::GSW season went downhill after the Feb 5 HOU game. Mark Jackson thug move,sorry old-school move to have no easy shots or to "hurt" HOU players attempting another 3. Karma is a B****h!
sports guy12::How did the Jazz win?  Kevin Martin take the shots for OKC
NDFRockets18::He also played the defense for OKC
kjleon10::Chandler Parsons simply does not receive enough attention.
ScrewedUpTexan713::super underrated
NDFRockets18::His performance in the 3rd quarter is the main reason Houston won tonight. He'll get more attention as Houston continues to get more.
amak110::Plenty of chicks give him attention
amak110::I'm just hoping that Matt Schaub can throw like Flacco next season
ScrewedUpTexan713::we'll worry about that when the time comes
tomBabauts::What happened to GSW?
ScrewedUpTexan713::hand down man down !
tomBabauts::I thought they will be good when Bogut returns. I though wrong.  Bogut = good center, Lee=All-star, Barnes, Klay(solid shooter), Curry(almost an all star)
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Bogut has a few weeks yet before hes on his game and the system has fully incorporated him in
LightsGoDownIntheCity::They thought having a Bogut at 80% was going to help them and their D
NDFRockets18::had a horrible stretch in the 3rd but other than that had a very solid game.
KeriTheCreoleTexan::Reality.
amak110::That's weird I only asked what LOF stood for in this chat  then I went to the lakers suns chat and asked it there but I gues it got posted here twice
KeriTheCreoleTexan::I don't think they know what it means.
NewcastleFanVL::Amak, you must be related to Asik: butterfingers !
amak110::H
LightsGoDownIntheCity::p  damn, too late and ruined the game
NDFRockets18::I blame ESPN's horribly laggy boards, not you  It would work brilliantly if it said positive instead of p
NDFRockets18::V
eenz3::Positive
eenz3::Positive
sports guy12::I
amak110::What  does LOF stand for
KeriTheCreoleTexan::Read the responses to your previous post.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::stated below
sports guy12::30 wins before the break would be nice
NDFRockets18::No Harden though, fingers crossed. Hopefully Lin, Parsons etc can step it up like they did against SA the game where he was out.
DuaneXC::Honestly, I really hope they do shut Harden down for this game and we don't see him until OKC.  There is no reason at all to push nagging injuries to the knee and ankle when a week's rest will probably do the trick.
amak110::What does LOF stand for
bocabenny33433::You can do both ... I'm a NY Jet fan (I know, embarassing), but I am a Tebow fan as well. You can't say anything bad on how that young man (or Lin) handles himself.  When the Jets act like jerks on how they treated him, I root for Tebow to one day show them up just like he did last year while on the Broncos and beat them.  Bottom line - Team is just a group of folks that play in a city .... while the player and his character should is beyond the team.  Would you root for your home team if it was a bunch of thugs?
KeriTheCreoleTexan::Lin Only Fan
ScrewedUpTexan713::lin only fan which mean he only roots for lin not the Rockets
wHiTeTiGeR007::DUDE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ROOT FOR CAUSE THEY'RE STILL PART OF THE TEAM.  INSTEAD OF SINGLING OUT LIN FANS, YOU NEED TO STOP BEING BIASED BY LABELING HIS FANS WITH NAMES CAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU DIVIDE THE FANBASE AND CAUSE HATE;)
ScrewedUpTexan713::thats the thing we root for the team not just one person and if there fake well nothin we can do about it there cause trouble and real rockets fans are gonna defend the TEAM
wHiTeTiGeR007::I'VE NEVER SAY LIN WAS A GOD AMONGS THEM.  I'M JUST RESPONDING TO THE ONES WHOM ARE BIASED TOWARD LIN FANS;)
wHiTeTiGeR007::REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU ROOT FOR, THEY'RE STILL ON THE SAME TEAM SO THE LOF CRITICS JUST NEED TO CALM THEMSELVES DOWN.  AND AGAIN, MOST OF THE HATING ARE CAUSED BY FAKE LIN FANS TRYING TO DIVIDE THE FANBASE SO THE REAL FANS COULD TAKE THE BLAME FOR IT;)
ScrewedUpTexan713::yea but he scores 30 and loses and Lin has like 9 points and doesnt play u blame the coaches harden the players but dont question lins play
KeriTheCreoleTexan::wHiTeTiGeR007 - screw ACTUALLY THE FANS ARE ONLY COMPLAINING WHEN HARDEN GOES 30 +PTS ON 5-30FG IN A GAME LOSS.  OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S ALL GOOD;)  You can't be serious...
wHiTeTiGeR007::screw ACTUALLY THE FANS ARE ONLY COMPLAINING WHEN HARDEN GOES 30 +PTS ON 5-30FG IN A GAME LOSS.  OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S ALL GOOD;)
KeriTheCreoleTexan::Red, as stated below, there is nothing wrong with rooting for your favorite player. It becomes an issue when one roots for that one player, flood the board with hatred against everything, except that one player, and does it consistently every game.
ScrewedUpTexan713::yea that fine but how about you just root for the team instead of the player cause its a team game thats all im saying your fav player plays for the Rockets so root for them not just lin
wHiTeTiGeR007::I'M JUST SAYING STOP BEING SELECTIVE AND BIASED TOWARDS LIN FANS, WHICH IS USUALLY THE CASE WITH LOF HATERS.  THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH FANS ROOTING FOR THEIR FAVORITE PLAYER AND A WIN TO GO ALONG WITH IT.  SERIOUSLY WHAT'S THERE TO CHEER ABOUT IF YOUR FAVORITE PLAYER IS IN A LOSING GAME?;)
ScrewedUpTexan713::but yall dont as soon as harden gets points and wins games you say he shoots too much and doesnt pass whens his ast shows that he passes
NDFRockets18::I'm rooting for the Rockets to win and hope Harden has a good game in that win but it's secondary. I'm happier in a Rockets win where Harden plays bad than a Rockets loss where Harden scores 45
wHiTeTiGeR007::SO IF I'M ROOTING FOR HARDEN, THAT MEANS I'M NOT ROOTING FOR THE ROCKETS AS WELL?  HAHA GOTTA LOVE THE LOF CRITICS AND THEIR LOGICS;)
NewcastleFanVL::Nonsense.
wHiTeTiGeR007::LISA ONLY FAN;)
LightsGoDownIntheCity::7 players in double digits while Harden was hurt, pretty incredible night by Houston. Really spread the ball around, Id love to see the Rockets do some damage to a team like Denver or LA in the playoffs.
m_gunners::i believe while it was a good win,Rockets took too many 3 points attempt while they leading which for me is not a good coaching strategy.....they were only 295 after making over 30 attempts but still won...therefore it was an escape today as GSW were playing bad....for improvments,Rockets must learn from their other losses but Mchale seems to fail to do it!
FlopFloat::Rox still inexperience playing to their opponents unless pressured into playing hard.
NDFRockets18::The game was very tight except for that period in the 3rd quarter where it felt like Houston had 5 fastbreaks in 3 minutes. In all fairness Houston got outplayed in the first half, they were lucky to be close and especially be up by 1.  Denver though is probably the last team I wanna see in the playoffs. They always seem to have our number.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Exactly, Westbrook is still too young and inexperienced to carry that weight although give the guy a few years and hes going to be scary
NDFRockets18::For some reason I feel better about OKC in the playoffs than I do Denver. Maybe it's just how they have been in the playoffs the last two years where they succeeded when Durant and Harden were hot and Westbrook wanted to become the hero and end up bricking/turning over the ball. I trust Westbrook to screw up in big moments than I trust him excelling.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Our D couldnt keep up, relied too much on Bogut being back and were a step behind and sloppy. Cant do that against a team that scores 106 a game.   Yea, we barely grabbed a game from the Nugs this year. I know how you feel, they make us look silly
KeriTheCreoleTexan::I'd rather see Denver, than OKC or SA.
I Jeremy Lin I Eat Dog LeBron James Monkey::Jeremy Lin's mouth starts to water when he sees his neighbor walk the dog.
KeriTheCreoleTexan::Unnecessary.
NewcastleFanVL::Every board got a couple of MFs like this .
sports guy12::time for bed
LightsGoDownIntheCity::flagged
NDFRockets18::Sigh, the only problem Rockets fans have with LOF is that they care more about Lin's stats than the team winning. Lin can be their favorite player, no issue with that however I'm sure Lin cares more about winning than the box score. I love Harden but I would rather him go 1-8 with 4 pts in a win than him score 45 in a loss. Team first, then player.
akhorahil::If it wasn't for the LOFs, I might actually be happy Lin is on the Rockets. He's a decent PG with plenty of upside left. But these know nothing celebrity stalkers are absolutely ruining the experiance for me. At this point, I'd honestly rather have a lessor PG just to see these "fans" leave.
amak110::WHat Is LOF?
JonathanGeorgeRD::Lin Only Fan, what a joke of a fan base.
C4Charles::let me clear it up for you: i'm a lin's fan and I also want the rocket to win. Wins = playoff more chance for him to play this season and improve his game. The dude is improving...
mazariamonti_fourth_profile::WHY IS EVERYONE YELLING
NDFRockets18::LOUD NOISES
wHiTeTiGeR007::YOU GOT IT BACKWARDS.  LOF DOESN'T CARE ABOUT LIN'S STATS BUT RATHER THAT HE GETS UTILIZED PROPERLY TO HIS POSITION;)
m_gunners::i have to admit that Lin has been playing well in the past few games but seems to be underplayed....(only against Kings he played longer)....well,perhaps he is carrying a slight injury or he has his stamina limitations, we won't know but Mchale did subsitute him in rather odd times as well...
wHiTeTiGeR007::LIKE I SAY, MOST OF THEM ARE FAKE LIN FANS TRYING TO RILED UP EVERYBODY SO THE REAL LIN FANS COULD GET BLAME FOR IT;)
NDFRockets18::Don't be lazy, just scroll down and look at the comments from the majority of LOF. There is your evidence
wHiTeTiGeR007::ACTUALLY THAT'S FALLACY AT IT'S BEST ON YOUR PART.  YOU'RE MERELY SPECULATING WITHOUT ANY REAL FACTS TO BACK UP YOUR ARGUMENT.  PLEASE DO PROVIDE SOME EVIDENCE...OTHERWISE IT'S JUST AN OPINION;)
KeriTheCreoleTexan::Red, you know as well as anyone here that a lot of the people rooting for Lin could care less about the Rox, as a team, success. That isn't fallacy.
wHiTeTiGeR007::I AGREED WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID EXCEPT THE PART ABOUT LOFs NOT CARING ABOUT A TEAM WIN CAUSE THAT'S JUST NAIVE AND LUDICROUS!;)
NDFRockets18::I do make sense. Everyone wants their favorite player do well and win at the same time. The issue is, if they chose, preferring the player doing well over the team winning. LIke I said, i love Harden and ideally want him to excel in a win, but I would prefer him to do poorly and the Rockets win than him do great and they lose.
wHiTeTiGeR007::keri AND YOU'RE STILL WRONG ABOUT THAT PART.  CMON SERIOUSLY YOU MEAN TO TELL ME LOFs ARE LIKE MELO FANS?  ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS HIM JACKING UP 30+ PTS IN A LOSING GAME LOL?  HAHA LET'S NOT GET CARRY AWAY HERE;)
KeriTheCreoleTexan::wHiTeTiGeR007 - AND WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THEIR FAVORITE PLAYER SUCCEED AND WIN AT THE SAME TIME?  YOU DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL;)  He's saying that LOF's DON'T care about the Rockets winning; only Lin's success. He's not wrong.
wHiTeTiGeR007::BTW, MOST OF THEM ARE FAKE LIN FANS TRYING TO STIR THINGS UP AND THEN THE REAL LIN FANS GET BLAME FOR IT ;)
wHiTeTiGeR007::AND WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THEIR FAVORITE PLAYER SUCCEED AND WIN AT THE SAME TIME?  YOU DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL;)
HoustonRoxkets::OMG MCHALE BENCH LIN FIRE HIM
NDFRockets18::Semantics. LOF still care more about Lin succeeding in a game than the team.
FlopFloat::Let me get this straight. Just trying understand where all these feelings come from.  For LOF there are either: those with Asian pride OR there are those who believe in Yellow Power?  For LOF haters there are either: those who are sensitive/annoyed OR there are those who believe in Black Power?
bobbydagreat::WTF are you babbling about?
NDFRockets18::Exactly. Houston excels against GS, Utah, NY etc but stumbles against OKC, Denver and SA. Weird matchup deals
LightsGoDownIntheCity::very true, every fanbase has its bad apples. We got our a.sses handed to us again and I wouldnt want to see Houston come playoff time. GS matches up well with specific teams but we just dont have the ability to roll with the Spurs, Rockets, Jazz style of teams
NDFRockets18::I like GS, actually I think the 2 teams in NoCal have great fanbases. I don't think many Rockets fans dislike the Warriors fans I just think a select few got defensive over how a select few of the Warriors fans reacted in the last game
LightsGoDownIntheCity::GS fans are a pretty good fanbase, we have 0 success in the last 30yrs so really have no sh.it to talk. As a whole were pretty humble. I dont get why Rocket fans have so much hate towards us...
ScrewedUpTexan713::who cares Rockets got the DUB ohhhh sorry GSW fans lol
ScrewedUpTexan713::Im a be shocked if Harden play against the Clips well not shocked but pretty suprised
FlopFloat::Idk, it looked pretty nasty. Pretty sure it will be swallon for a couple of days unless be pulled a lebron.
NDFRockets18::I want him to play because we have a better chance of winning with Harden on 1 leg still but 1 game isn't worth the risk
bobbydagreat::Yeah I don't think there is any way he plays.
ScrewedUpTexan713::I dont think so either but hes leaving hope lol
49ers9::California supplies the nation with Google, Apple, Facebook, Skype, and Dropbox, Texas supplies the nation with T. Boone Pickens and racism You decide what's better
degjoe06::Skype was a European company, now owned by Microsoft located in the State of Washington. Texas has Dell and most of HP (former Compaq and the part that makes money as in Servers and PC's and laptops). There are others but they're not as big as these two.
KeriTheCreoleTexan::lol @ Apple. Apple is garbage, dude. Like Chuck said, Google is about the only good thing you listed.
ChuckOlajuwon::Thats some crappy software companies.  Apple? Facebook?  Google is about the only good thing you listed.  Oh and Houston is energy capitol of the country and space city.  Not to mention help balance the economy that California is almost single handily killing.
sports guy12::don't forget oil, California cars do run on them
HoboJustice::Pretty sure they run on soy
HoboJustice::California is bankrupt.
NDFRockets18::Houston still supplies the nation with energy. Still better unless you want to ride your bike everywhere and light candles instead of using electricity
NDFRockets18::Oh and lets see how your software works without the energy to supply the factories that make them and what is needed to run them
wHiTeTiGeR007::SAY HI TO CHRIS DORNER;)
NDFRockets18::Say hi to the std's in hollywood
49ers9::Say hi to Barbara's bush u nasty $@%!$@%!$@%!
NDFRockets18::Say hi to the Zodiac killer. This is fun
49ers9::SAY HI TO A CHAINSAW MASSACRE :D
The Waco Kidd::I amend my previous contention.  On ***MARCH 1*** the WC standings from 6-8 will be: 6. Utah (33-25) 7. Golden State (32-26)  8. Houston (31-28) May very well change by year's end, but that's where they will be on March 1.
NDFRockets18::Still think Utah will be 8th then, Portland could even knock them off.
The Waco Kidd::Jazz aren't dealing either of them unless it's for high value and that's not likely to happen and Derrick Favors is ready to replace either of them if one does get traded.
NDFRockets18::Harden has a very minor ankle deal but that's all. My main reasoning is I think Utah deals Jefferson or Millsap before the deadline and I could see them stumble the last 2 weeks of february, depending on who they might get back.
The Waco Kidd::Are the Rockets dealing with any injuries at the moment?
