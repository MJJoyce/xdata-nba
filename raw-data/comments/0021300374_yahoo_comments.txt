Ralph::So, since Prokhorov bought the Nets he replaced the GM Ron Thorn with Billy King, and the coach Avery with Kidd, signed off on basically trading away six high draft picks for Pierce and Garnett (who'll only probably be here for one season) and Williams who hasn't played remotely at a level that justifies what they gave up for him.  Look at the record of the Nets the first three years after they joined the NBA.  That's what Net fans have to look forward to for the next 5-7 years.
