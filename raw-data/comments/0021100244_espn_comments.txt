Eltonjr28::to all u clowns who say we cant beat the heat we can and will. rip hamilton puttin up 20 against cha and 22 last night it took bogans almost 5 games just to score what hamiltion had in 2 games. we got more scoring now.
bs20kj34::heat trolls will always have something to say
chuck4dude::nigg.as still worried about some typing  nobody as.s nigg.as lonely nigg.as i bet yall dont got no friends yall moms and dads dont even like yall yo moms wish she would have swallowed you and yo siblings           NOW LET ME PUT IT IN ENGLISH Your mother wishes that she suck your daddy's dic.k so you wasn't born. was that good english
bs20kj34::"Your mother wishes that she sucked your daddy's dic.k so that you weren't born." so no it was not written well.....
yardog59::Hey, chucky.................................how do you fit so much stupid in that head of yours??
kfoges03::swing and a miss
drinking beer with cutler::Idiot ^^. His mom should be persecuted for giving birth to such an idiot
buzzard1022::no
Yesman222::White Mamba don't do it like that! Man that boy is smooth.
42Wolverine21::bulls cant beat the heat anyways bulls don got enough support for derrick
DROSE-IS-NUMBER-ONE::ha cant beat the heat? your a idiot if you really think that, even when rose is out, they still take care of business. just like buzzard1022 said, the deepest team in the nba
bs20kj34::you're cool bro...
chuck4dude::buzzard a lame as.s nigg.a the chi is the king of all cities chi crazy with nigg.as that dont have good english but we get it in popping pills smoking loud and fuc.king hoes that dont take good english to do but you cant do none of these things ILD bitc.h I LOVE DRUGS
buzzard1022::LOL, the bulls have the deepest team in the league.
CommandChiefPete::heat can't beat the bucks, so what does that say?
1 Wk At a Time::That any team can win a game.... The biggest question is can the Bulls win 4 out of 7 this year in the playoffs against the Heat... I met alot of Bulls fans that talked a whole lot in game 1 but were no where to be found the rest of the series except the cool fans that gave props to the defense.... I think the Bulls will most likely win the majority of the games in the season against the Heat while its separated, but in a 7 game playoff series when adjustments are made the game after..... That's when you find out your teams worth.
Jboat1221::"but the Nets simply were simply overwhelmed playing their third game in as many nights." - Are you kidding me? The Nets simply were simply overwhelmed? Where does espn find these people?
bs20kj34::quit $@%!$@%! about the Bulls schedule, when it was made it was the NBAs toughest. the Bulls can't help that teams are underperforming. cryami fans go to your own board and discuss how to beat a team at home that you're supposed to beat (take notes from the box score/play-by-play tabs here if necessary). sit down and shut up. lebron fans come back when he has A ring let alone 6.
chuck4dude::these is like facebook stew and stew said nigg.as are typing gangstas wont bust a grape its funny cause i find myself commenting on the lame shi.t nigg.as say people always saying something bout english the way people type thats lame shi.t the dumbest nigg.a in the world can be the richest nigg.a or the toughest so use something else cause the avg(smart) person is a nobody in life DOES THIS SOUND LIKE YOU
chuck4dude::money
buzzard1022::Can someone translate that post into English?
chuck4dude::bitc.hes do shi.t like this nobody as.s nigg.as get something to do besides worry how a nigg.a talk what you want to be my ho.e cause we suppose to be men yall acting like some bitc.hes only ho.es listen to a person talk their pimp so if thats the best you got then thats whats up soilid til the world blow ENGLISH ha thats funny         bustitbaby  make that as.s clap bustit bustit bustit
bs20kj34::lmao. this guy can't be serious.
SouthFLAnative::educated post ^^
meisenberger::When the NETS went to Back-To-Back finals with Kidd, Martin, Kittles and Jefferson we were "Hapless" as well. It was because the "East was weak" or some other dumb ESPN comment. The Nets may not have as many (BANDWAGON?) fans as teams like the (Pathetic?!?) Knicks, Bulls or Lakers but I am totally fine with that. The Nets fans out there are Die-Hards that actually support their team through thick and thin. Oh, one more thing, ESPN should always refer to the Knicks as HAPLESS. Last time the HAPLESS Knicks won a playoff game Carmelo hadn't been born yet. ESPN shows ridiculous bias and it's embarrassing.
drinking beer with cutler::Wow that's ridiculous. Chicago has by far the most dedicated and loyal fans around the world. Good try though.
chuck4dude::i dont think the bulls have BANDWAGONNERS dont be mad at chicago for not going thru what the nets are going thru now the knicks(carmelo) is something you have a point on the chi got real die hard fans look at the cubs and they sell out every game so miss the chi with that bullshi.t
JoePa got what he deserved::Da Bulls!!!
chuck4dude::I like yo name
nwhardt::Why does NJ even have a team....?
meisenberger::They don't. The Nets are going to be in Brooklyn next year. They are pretty much already there.
GVTFOO::skip bayless thank lebron for making your career then thank tebow for making it even bigger
chuck4dude::tebow should thank skip lebrick should thank wade if they win the ship for making him a champ cause he needed help and it aint like jordan pippen and rodman came the next three viatrade/free agent or the lakers cause kareem was already there worthy got drafted the celtics was the same way bird didnt go there he got drafted there and shaq and kobe shaq went for the fame and ended up winning when got there tim ducan got drafted to the spurs didnt let the city down by leaving dirk did it with a bunch of roll players in their 30's
Kickin_Chickens::D Rose is like a Ferrari with a bunch Hyundai's out on the court.
Rambomonster9::Let me just say this.... there were years when Kevin johnson had similar numbers (2 more assists per game) and was not even an all star.  sad for Mr, KJ
footbawll::the nets are atrocious, i wish they would just pack up and leave NJ forever.....
meisenberger::They are leaving, smart one.
Kickin_Chickens::They are moving to Brooklyn next year so your wish is coming true.
chuck4dude::why do other team fans come on the chicago page to say that the bulls and drose are overrated and its always a heat fan but yall wish the bulls would have drafted beasley so yall could get rose so it seems like you guys and girls are contradicting yourself you wanted him but now he is overrated dont be mad cause we got the best one from chicago and yall got the suburb guy the follower(wade), the old guy who looks gay at times(howard) and the over weight lover 300 plus 7 feet in high school and didnt win the state ship he should have avg like 40pts 20rebs in school(curry)
burdowse87::kill urself
chuck4dude::i would but i cant fill my face
chuck4dude::english dont make no money
chuck4dude::cause its some in my pocket is you rollen bitc.h i might be
buzzard1022::How would you know, you dont speak it
chuck4dude::when it does maybe then thats when nigg.as like me will have to worry money talk bullshi.t walk you type i dont talk that much
nwhardt::Quality English education ^^^
buzzard1022::It came naturally? I dont think so
chuck4dude::plus ho.es love thug nigg.as look at yo name thats english  in my type talk lol lmao lmmfao smmfh smh plus i diidnt go to school to learn english i was born here in america so it came naturally
chuck4dude::wades a follower wade used to be a quiet nigg.a now he talks is it cause the clowns came to mia that dude is a  follower just like a suburb nigg.a he doing the cam newton wade would not have did that before the clowns came the zoe pound nigg.as should be mad the circus came to town
sespi001::suburb?? And pluse... Wade&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rose pettles
Oxfordian Theory::©õõ£ š†ô®¥ ß®ø
cardseller05::Did LeGone take notes on how to win when your teammates go down with an injury?
blh7068::and lost at home to the Bucks, too.
sespi001::Rose beat the weakest team with an injured center when his average teammate was injured.... Lebron beat the lakers spurs and sixers, all with winning records, without a superstar teammate
Eddie_Z8::We're beating the teams on our schedule...we don't get to choose who we play...we'd beat those teams too if we played them. BULLS!!!
chuck4dude::so bosh aint no supastar bout time some one said some real shi.t                               my english^
chuck4dude::and rose is hurt right now
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Idk was he suppose too? seems like he's doing a good job without wade
DogOnLoose::Bucks.
chuck4dude::@blkmex if you black and mexican then yo moms got the deepest...............lol never mind can we all just get along
WddNews.com::If I was coaching in the NBA this season..  During the first 3/4s of the year I would play two 5-player units and rotate them every 6 minutes...Noone would play over 30 minutes in any game.  These guys all need rest the banging on the bodies is going to wear them down at best and cause numerous injuries.
mphilip87::Lebron: So..when can i call myself great? Kobe: Just be a 13x NBA All-star, win 5 titles and be the finals MVP 2 times... Jordan: ...Then win 1 more title be an All star 1 more time, a finals MVP 4 more times, become the season MVP 5x and u got it kid!
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::BlkMexMamba:...But even then Lebron, you will never be great.
Fantasy Loser::I missed the game last night, mens league hoop night. Did anyone else have to pick their jaw up off the floor when they looked at the box score and saw the "White Mamba's" minutes. That might be more than all of last season!
nwhardt::The Bulls have the deepest squad in the NBA
bmosheman::strike
bmosheman::[s]Strikethrough[/s]
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Your mom has the Deepest........lol never mind. Yeah, they pretty good
permatroll::OMG that move by scalabrine!!! best white player in the league. sorry dirk and kevin.
10Detroitsux10::BULLS!!
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::HEAT!!!.... i hate them, dont you? they suck, especially that one guy Lebenon....or some sh*t..
Oxfordian Theory::In 1987-88 Michael Jordan put up the greatest single season Player Efficiency Rating mark in modern NBA history with <b>31.71</b>.  In 2011-12 LeBron James is rolling with a Player Efficiency Rating of <b>35.22</b>.  Carry on.
mphilip87::Lebron: So..when can i call myself great? Kobe: Just be a 13x NBA All-star, win 5 titles and be the finals MVP 2 times... Jordan: ...Then win 1 more title be an All star 1 more time, a finals MVP 4 more times, become the season MVP 5x and u got it kid!
Akuma2K::Jordan= 6 rings  Lebrick= 0 rings  carry on.
Robert156877::Your right, it is meaningless.  LeBron could very well get 6 rings playing on Wade's team, just like Kerr got 6 rings playing on Jordan's team, but he couldn't say he is par to Michael Jordan unless he gets 3 straight, takes two years off, and then gets three more straight or just wins 9 straight, because that's what Jordan would have done if he didn't get bored with basketball twice.
SkinsFan9104478::Meaningless?  Are you $@%!$@%!?  The only thing that matters in basketball is winning the championship.  If you aren't first, you're last.
mdtuzo::meaningless observation
nwhardt::And...I can think of 6 things that make your PER rating pointless....
GrizzK4::LeBron can go f*ck a goat.
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::...Nice....   Thats the realest sh** someone has ever said on here.
miguel151551::stop trying to compare Lechocke to Jordan!!! you can be a fan of him but you have to be an ignorant moron to compare him to Jordan.......... MJ was and always will be the best that ever played!!!!!
Gogoberrymix6::LeBron is GOAT
Gogoberrymix6::Overrated Bulls
cardseller05::You have your picture as Adam Morrison, nuff said.
MJandKobe::bulls are going to slap that smile off your face when they slap over-rated/trash miami in the playoffs
drftw42134::@MJandKobe lmao!
BoobieSqueeze::That move by Scal...
Bulls now 16-3::I hope Heatster has some new jokes when the Bulls beat the Heat in the ECF this year.
Bookiebreaker48::NICE WIN FOR DA BULLS....BUT I GOTTA SAY WASSUP WIT DA COACH PULLING OUT THE BENCH AND INSERTING THE STARTERS WITH 3 MINUTES TO GO IN DA GAME UP BY 16....ON TOP OF THT THE NETS HAD THEIR 2ND UNIT IN.....? PADDING STATS? KIND OF AN $@%!$@% MOVE IF U ASK ME
dabulls2012::Dude is KILLING me with his subs! That's what go Lu hurt on Sat...put him back in with 3 min to go up by 10 against a team that couldn't score 10 in 3 min...he doesn't get it! No trophy for having the best regular season record Thibs!
devrukn::Let's skip to the post season tomorrow so the Bulls can eliminate Miami and their trolls.
SkinsFan9104478::You misspelled "will"
mdtuzo::bulls cant beat the heat in a 7 game series. fact.
Baron Harkonnen::There is Chicago's template for postseason success ... every starter scores in double digits, Rose takes only 16 shots and gets better shots as a result, shooting +50%.  Of course it all relies on Hamilton staying healthy and Boozer and Noah remaining productive ... but this is how Chicago has to look to mean anything in the postseason.
littleshovel::Bulls just puttin up the W's baby!!!  DA BULLS!!!!
Playing2wintheGame::dingleberry &gt; gogoberry
CowboysBullsLonghornsStarsRangers::Lol at ya'll  telling gogoberry how it is!!
Bulls now 16-3::Chris Hansen:  "Have a seat Gogoberry, what are you doing here?".
Gogoberrymix6::Really impressive win against the Nets tonight who were on a back to back to back
Robert156877::Actually, teams have done surprisingly well in the third game of a back-to-back-back this year.  As of Jan 9th, they were 6-0 for the third game.  I'm not sure what they are now.
Riczaj01::Look at how many home games San Antonio has had compared to us also. It's outrageous.
lovesports3409::^^^This.
saadenger11::insane. how do the bulls get stuck with the most ridiculous schedule of all time???
dabulls2012::Once the Bulls get past the All-Star break, their schedule should become a LOT easier while the rest of the league catches up...don't forget after finishing this 4-game homestand to get within 1 game of being even with home/away, the Bulls then go on the road for 9 straight over 14 days so they'll have 20 on the road and only 10 at home!
--.Bullster.--::10 compared to 8?
dabulls2012::By the way, Bulls are 7-2 on the second game of back-to-backs...not our fault the rest of the league can't handle it (Miami is 2-3...funny how they've only had 5 while the Bulls have had 9 already, huh?)
Bulls now 16-3::The Heat were more Impressive in their loss to the Bucks right?
--.Bullster.--::6 players in double figures and Orlando had 1. Also really impressive
dabulls2012::I think Orlando is still waiting to play the second half of that game tonight...
dabulls2012::Derrick was impressive too coming off toe injury...thanks @gogo!
Riczaj01::and a hobbled Rose solid too and we sat a pro bowl worthy forward in Deng. ya it was pretty impressive.
--.Bullster.--::you're right! Rip Boozer and Noah were really impressive
marcouofi::scalabrine is good, i don't know why he doesn't get more minutes. also, why are they not playing jimmy butler?
dabulls2012::Thibs subs continue to absolutely baffle me...I'm sure Deng got hurt at the end of that game on Sat when the Bulls should have finished off Charlotte earlier...would have had Thibs not inexplicably put CJ and Rip back in when they clearly thought they were done with the bench extending the lead to 15...Bulls winning thanks to Thibs' D but despite how he does everything else...
Riczaj01::If the game was as out of hand as the articles/highlights are making it out to be, the whole bench should have got more minutes.
maxsexhammer::Scalabrine for Howard straight up. Problem solved.
dabulls2012::Would Scal have been able to help the Magic get to 60 points tonight against the geriatric Celtics? Maybe you're right!
BullsBearsBlackhawksCubs::this game was won by scalabrine. white mamba in the clutch
--.Bullster.--::his 5 points plus 4 assists leading to 9 points... game really was won by scal haha
Riczaj01::He's a ginger haired beast! Gotta love that kind of talent coming off the bench, it speaks volumes that he's buried behind a couple other quality players.
Riczaj01::stunned that espn didn't delete him and his posts, pretty pathetic...looks like it was a great game for the team. Good to see Noah back to doing something on O. This team needs to get healthy and stay healthy to make a legit run. Rip looks like he is getting more comfortable w/the team.
Riczaj01::That would suck. He finally got out of the injury funk, to see him miss subsantial time b/c of an injury would really be bad
bigjoel_2000::yeah, let's hope Deng doesn't need surgery like they are speculating...
Riczaj01::ya he's been huge in getting them involved inthe game. I would have liked to see a few more of the bench mob get some more legit minutes w/the starters so banged up though, no reason to run these guys into the ground when there is so little rest.
--.Bullster.--::i wonder how many of Rips assists went to Noah. His presence is helping Boozer and Noah so much
Bulls now 16-3::Spammers must have some fascinating lives.
saadenger11::lol are u gonna change your screen name every time the bulls win?
Riczaj01::and they have now been deleted, cap/na.zi has gone bye bye; or at least his posts have...shame it didn't happen an hour ago.
DogOnLoose::You would think someone would get paid to do this... Just a habit of his/her/it's...
Riczaj01::what else do pre teens have to do after 8pm but annoy people on the internet?
--.Bullster.--::boy this party sure died...
Riczaj01::ah daddy doesn't give him enough attention apparently.
1 Wk At a Time::It seems he does this on every big market city team.... so far he's been on the Lakers, Clippers, Heat, and Bulls posts
Riczaj01::espn should have moderators watching for that kind of b.s. and delete them/their posts asap. the fact that they let that jag do that is sad and but not really suprising from them.
Bulls now 16-3::that dumb n.azi killed everyone.
samer598::Your a joke.
