Darth Apollyon::A team that does not depend on one piece to win, yet do have those pieces for when the game is on the line is very dangerous, and more when is a veteran team like the Spurs. People could get injured and the difference would not be much, no matter who it is as they have the people to substitute the void.  They should cruise to their spot in the playoffs, taking deserve rest in the final weeks, while teams kill themselves trying to reach a spot  or to stay in a spot in those same final weeks.
Christian::This is what many didn't thought off.. Belinelli was a GREAT acquisition for the spurs... seems manu / Belineli tandem off the bench is one of the best 1-2 punch of the spurs.. its like ok you beat the 1st unit but can your 2nd unit beat our 2nd unit, its almost like the 2nd unit can outwork the 1st unit given the chance.. Production from all of their streak was bcoz of the 2nd unit was productive.. Kudos to Coach Pop and the SA Org. for such a great acquisition.. :)) GSG!!!
Son of Gecko::What a team! Pop is easily the greatest manager in NBA today! Ask to the supporters of Brooklyn or New York...
PINATBATER::Fundamental basketball,   thats why nobody from the team  gets  injured so easily,  they play balance basketball.
Carmelo::Spurs knows how to win. Other teams don't.
PKM::Tim Duncan vs the New Tim Duncan.
Pebbles::Is there something wrong with Splitter? It seems he didn't start at the 2nd half.
Wake Up::What a deep bench and a great coach. Go old timers. I'd like to see them win one more NBA title before they fade into the twilight. Should have done it last year. Big mistake cost em.
fup duck::blow out
donald::Eric Gordon, your career is wondering where you are
