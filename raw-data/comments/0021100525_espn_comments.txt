themightyrule10::Pek is overrated. 37 minutes??? What?
Nikoloz3::Looks like Love needs some of the Pacers' tough pills.
The Man From Down Under::Would someone kindly tell Kevin Love that the 3 point comp is over and that he is a Power Forward?
azviking101::would someone tell the officials that when Love is getting mugged by three guys, then that is a trip to the foul line
s37en::ref's = minnesota's only competition, from every sport.  from the mlb vs yankee foul ball fair call, to the nfl not calling dirty hits. losing chance at superbowl. to the nhl letting other teams board us to the point of 3/5 top o linemen out  44 different players with ice time...  OFFICIATING vs minnesota teams is pathetic at best.
themightyrule10::ok I agree it seems the Vikings always get bad luck....but the wolves get sooo many calls. Ricky Rubio, JJ barea, and Kevin love are all masters at acting. If ANYTHING, they flop a little TOO much.
azviking101::officiating does hate Minnesota
azviking101::Well, that was easily the worst reffed basketball game I have ever seen.
Syracuse_Orange44::Steve Nash is still a monster!
SDunick::to bad he's about to retire.
SDunick::i know he's getting old. i got no source to back it up because i know old people retire.
steviebizzle::He is not about to retire. What source do you have to back it up? He just said in an interview he hopes to play another couple years. 17 assists tonight, no sign of slowing down.
GoTaliek::Woh, Nash showed Rubio how to be a point guard last night.  I'll cut T'Wolves some slack, 3 in a row!
mn_tanz::Yeah, it's tough to have three in a row, all on the road, all against teams that are fresh off the all-star break.
darkhorse2128::wow   lots of haters out there..........lets see one team on 3rd game in three nights and other team had an 8 days rest...........wonder who was gonna win? think all those old men would have been this good if it was other way around? dont brag when your team has a worst record then a team that wasnt suppose to win more then 20 games this year
doggbrown1::klove is the only good player on that team and minnesota wont even make the playoffs LOL
mn_tanz::That isn't accurate, and it didn't respond to anything dark horse said...
doggbrown1::damn bricky rubio needs to stop shooting altogether
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Steve Nash is a true point Guard.
Bricky Rubios Poor Shooting Percentage::hahahhahhaahah  Wolves suck.  Bricky "2 assist" Rubio
ShefHit::The Steve Nash Show
bobby30303::Suns win but can't handle Kobe/Lakers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmlTrVha3M8
_Hey_Joe::Wow, Rubio was 3/7 which is around 42 percent. I guess for Rubio's standard this was an excellent shooting night.
cSSk2011::KLove cant even lift his team against the suns? hes no superstar
s37en::or maybe you do it with the flu, and not getting a single call under the net. ref's won last nights game.
Murphy55410::Yeah, he only beats teams like the Clippers, Mavericks (twice).  Apparently he beats good teams and plays down to the talent of oppsing teams.  Enjoy riding Grampa Nash into the Lottery this year...
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::WOW.   Nash had 13 points, 8 rebound(???) and 17 assists!
T Dubbs::I love it, end of a back-to-back-to-back and only 8 players play. Adelman Ive been ok with you all season, but this was just dumb
49ersGoat::tater tots
MadmanMark14::KLove Sucks
DaBostonStrangler3::Nash is the $@%!$@% man. He needs to go to a contending team.
Forkitout24::read below. You missed the party dude. Good night.
SeahawkFanWOOHAA::Trade Nash to the Blazers or Mavs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
schroer123413123::$@%!$@ hate football you'd think them butches would be interested well atleast one side haha
SeahawkFanWOOHAA::Lol we got robbed by some rednecks and arena blocked by some treehugging inner city youth hating lesbians.
Forkitout24::That is what I wanted to hear. I miss the Sonics. In time you will get another team (Kings)
Forkitout24::Where is the Sonics?
Forkitout24::Saying goodnight to the LAC board right now.... night.

PhxSunsOwn13::yeah its baseball. lol
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::it isn't baseball? (and Pek is only in his 2nd year)
Forkitout24::I thought it was fantasy baseball.....LMAO. You got me.
clippsallday::I just realized the wolves got owned tonight! Can we say the other night was a fluke or what? hahaaaaa
norag1::Um idiots Wolves played 3 games in 3 nights. There is no fluke except maybe the Clips are not as good as you like to think.
clippsallday::That 3 that Love hit the first game was wide open thoo
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::1 for luck 2 for skill :p
clippsallday::Yea Nash one of my fav pgs of all time!
Forkitout24::We love Nash also. He makes Lopez a better player. LOL
Forkitout24::Possibly clippity clop! Suns are weak this year.
clippsallday::Haha will see. Nash wont go up against no rookie at pg tho..
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::it coulda been a fluke... but def not since it was the 2nd time we beat ya there
PhxSunsOwn13::Will be a great matchup.. always love Paul vs. Nash.
PhxSunsOwn13::tomorrow night we own you.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::Dangg... Suns have beaten us 9 ina row
PhxSunsOwn13::yep, saw that tweet.
Big 3 in Big D Dirk Deron and Dwight::Sources: Steve Nash demands a trade to Dallas to pair up with Dirk and Dwight Howard
Forkitout24::Dallas has already had their chance with Nash.
Forkitout24::go hide
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::dwight is along way from dallas atm
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::Anyone love watchin the tnt guys on thursday nights?
Forkitout24::I admit it I DO. Love K Smith and Sir Charles love affair
Forkitout24::Just so you guys know. I have a profile for the Dbacks also. It has a pic of a western diamondback coiled up ready to strike. That pic took me a few days to get approved.
PhxSunsOwn13::Barry Brauns
PhxSunsOwn13::nice.. whats your profile name for that one?
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::im not much into baseball, just made one for the heck of it
Forkitout24::I have enough on my plate. I have to feed this gorilla tummy and ego. Thanks for offering.
PhxSunsOwn13::either of you
PhxSunsOwn13::would you want to join a league drafting on saturday by any chance? very active league with some good owners.
Forkitout24::My forkit acct was banned 4 times so I used that one as backup. I also have another backup "SportFanatic_AZST" So I have 3 accts. LOL
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::my baseball fantasy team is gonnna own cause i got braun at like 50 because he was "suspended" at the time
PhxSunsOwn13::Oh yeah those damn Brewers fans suck... the true Giant fans are cool, but the bandwagoners suck.
Forkitout24::and Giants and Brewers! Why Brewers? Cause last year I got into it with several of them.
PhxSunsOwn13::oh yeah, I think I've seen that one before. Im so pumped to trash talk Dodger fans again... lol
Forkitout24::Fork-Gorilla-Redbird-Dback
Forkitout24::Somebody do a "planet of the Apes" as their profile
PhxSunsOwn13::I might do that, I will get sting to do King Kong then.
Forkitout24::I like both.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::great movie
Forkitout24::That chic in movie was HOT. (original one with Charleton Heston)
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::So a Pek and Gortat are good friends huh
Forkitout24::If you would have asked me last year about Gortat I would have said "trade him" NOW- OMG!!
PhxSunsOwn13::And both beast centers.
PhxSunsOwn13::yeah, what year is Pek in? Cant remember but I know he's new to the league, I own Pek and Gortat in most of my fantasy leagues.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::But Gortat owns, he's on a bunch of my fantasy teams
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::pek still has a long way to go, but huge upside, he's so strong
PadresChargersClippers::These Suns-fans comments are funny as f*ck.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::I thought it was all great until the lin lovers joined, then it got nasty
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::Pretty sure everyone has
Forkitout24::Have you heard Tebow lovers? fuckshit
PhxSunsOwn13::Thanks
PhxSunsOwn13::I mean people in arizona have great senses of humor. We fuckshit up.
PhxSunsOwn13::I literally laughed out loud.. oh god...haha
Forkitout24::I said that I would go to the local bar after the win and fuckshit an 80 yr old lady
Forkitout24::are you serious? you playin us brah?
PhxSunsOwn13::I say all Suns fan change their pictures to gorillas to identify ourselves.
MNSPORTS93::all the wolves are trying for cats and dogs but mine wont work, any suggestions?
Forkitout24::keep trying. It wil get through eventually.
Forkitout24::Can I be King Silverback? Or you since it was your idea.
Forkitout24::Did not know that. Great trivia. I got that in my fur pocket for keepsakes
PhxSunsOwn13::he really does! I noticed back in his UCLA days, called him the young grinch!
Forkitout24::LMAO, Tim Duncan.  Do you think Westbrook looks like the grinch?
PhxSunsOwn13::thats too much like Tim Duncan! lmao
Forkitout24::someone do "curious george"
Forkitout24::KING KONG. That is brilliant!! Do it.
PhxSunsOwn13::go for it.. lol I will go with king kong
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::is there any magic to changing your image? mine isn't workin
Forkitout24::It is easy.
Forkitout24::I got by the mods on my pic. I tried it again and was warned.  I say everyone try it. PLEASE.
Forkitout24::I was reading all that mumbo jumbo on J. Richardson banging Nash's wife. Hilarious. BTW, His X is hot and his new wife is hotter.
PhxSunsOwn13::J-Rich doesnt only "Slam Dunk" on the court, he does off the court as well. ;)
Forkitout24::Nash baby is white, really white.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::JJ Barea's wife is hot
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::miss universe lol
Forkitout24::reallly, I will google image her.
Forkitout24::Ok girls, I am off.   see ya tomorrow.
PhxSunsOwn13::The Gorilla has spoken.. give him his bananna.
Forkitout24::LOL
PhxSunsOwn13::Tough question: If Nash somehow ends up on the Lakers would you cheer for them to win a ring so Nash gets one? Idk if I could honestly..
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::magic, but they got nothing to offer anybody
Forkitout24::I would give Nash and Lopez for Dwight. LOL
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::You don't usually trade a star player within the division. From my POV,it would much worse if he went to the Spurs.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::any other contending teams need a pg?
Forkitout24::Bulls hate Rose
PhxSunsOwn13::magic maybe a contender with Nash, Anderson, Howard and all those shooters.
Forkitout24::Only team I can root for Nash is like the Kings (LOL) or OKC because I am a Osama Bin Harden lover and of course Kevin.
Forkitout24::good point. I like the Magic or the Sixers.
Forkitout24::Obama Bin Harden Abdul Bin Harden.
PhxSunsOwn13::lmao... Osama Bid Harden, I like it!
PhxSunsOwn13::copy.. captain fuckshit, over.
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::fuckshit that!
Forkitout24::fuckshit ditto
PhxSunsOwn13::lol
Forkitout24::hell no
PoRtEr_24::damn, I leave and come back to this.....fudge
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::i woulda been a dam cat if my picture would change
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::sh*tty internet or somethin
ARIZONAFAN4EVA:::)
Forkitout24::another cat? OMG. I cannot leave now.
PhxSunsOwn13:::)
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::My second favorite team is whoever is playing the Spurs on a given night.
Forkitout24::I want to break Kobe Bean's nose again when we meet up. I miss Raja Bell.
MandatoryMadnessInThe763::Good talking to you guys tonight, Good luck Suns fans!!!
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::Night and good luck to Wolves!
PhxSunsOwn13::take it easy
Forkitout24::I am now a wolf fan (behind guess who?). You have a great team.
PhxSunsOwn13::I cant wait for some trades to actually start going down... wonder who goes where.
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::Trade deadline is March 15th.
Forkitout24::Nash is already gonna be in the "ring of honor" at US Airways Center. So it's all good. He just better not become a Faker.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::nash deserves a title contending team to be honest
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::he does, i agree, while i would love to see him get a ring, i would rather him retire a sun
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::please no!
Forkitout24::Nash is gone! I can feel it.
Forkitout24::It is a slam dunk on retiring that 13
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::I hope not. Steve Nash should finish his career in a Suns uniform and someday have his number 13 retired by the Suns.
Forkitout24::Oh we gotta beat Griffin.
PhxSunsOwn13::I doubt it, I mean unless he asks for a trade they said they won't trade him, we'll see. At least Im going to the game tomorrow night to watch Nash maybe for the last time as a Sun... :(
bradonlywins::Steve Nash is a good guy
PhxSunsOwn13::Idk about you guys but I am extremely excited for the Dbacks this year! We gotta stacked team and things are looking up for us!
CB224737::Me too, with the Suns being bad for the first time in like a decade I can't wait for baseball season to start
Forkitout24::I will buy you a beer and dog.
Forkitout24::I'm going to March 3rd against the G's
PhxSunsOwn13::Nice.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::twins suck
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::yeah then you got the 1 or 2 year window before you have to sign your young stars to big contracts, and the yankees, red sox, and others offers are just too much
Forkitout24::When the Dbacks won it in 2001, they were 6th from the bottom of the list in overall salaries.
PhxSunsOwn13::While I agree, Dbacks and the Rays disagree. It much tougher on small markets but if you draft right and have a stacked farm system usually you can be successful.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::baseball is so dumb, why don't they just add a freaking cap, small market teams get no shot.
Forkitout24::who was that jabbawokee short guy for the Twins? oh yea Kirby Puckett. He was a bad mo fo. He  was the black Danny Devito
PhxSunsOwn13::they had there run a few years ago. Rebuild time.
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::Rubio is a true pg, hopefully we can steal him when his contract runs out ;) But really, Minnesota has a really good foundation, im glad to see small market teams be successful.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::yeah ppl think its winter all year haha, it get HOT in the summer.. maybe not AZ hot, but yeah
MandatoryMadnessInThe763::Sure hope, I think he actually has grown to like it here.  Minnesota is much more of a big city than people realize and the weather is really nice spring summer and fall.  we gotta lock him up
Forkitout24::Twin cities are cool I take back what I said earlier.
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::how does the cap space look for next yr for you guys?
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::you could possible land a star, that might propel you to contenders
MandatoryMadnessInThe763::its not terrible i think
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::dallas is gonna try to steal deron williams and dwight this offseason
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::doesn't matter, you're gonna need the "superstar" player that teams are trying to load up on now
BNS224::He’s one hundred percent Canadian. As are his tuxedos. He can speak 22 languages at the first grade level. He doesn’t do mouth to mouth because he’s all tongue. He can only give 100% the other 10% he donates to orphans... Nash = Ageless Wonder
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::sup guys
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::yeah f*ck the spurs
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::I hate the Spurs more than any other team. They are the only NBA team I proacticely root against.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::ehh, after wolves starting losing changed to knicks suck, haha
PhxSunsOwn13::Thats more of a Suns thing! ;) Fck them!
Forkitout24::and Spurs
PhxSunsOwn13::I think everyone hates NY, DAL, LA, and MIA.
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::lol
PhxSunsOwn13::scoreboard was your favorite word all night if I recall correctly?
Forkitout24::Hill is worth the money now but his first 8 years he was a liability.
Forkitout24::hey guys, We might have to trade Nash just to get cash, top pick or avail free agent. I say he has next year only and than he is out.  Thoughts?
Forkitout24::So leverage that and try to get another PG. KJ to Kidd, Kidd to Nash, Nash to ???
Forkitout24::I missed it.
MandatoryMadnessInThe763::that teardrop game winner last week was crazy!
Forkitout24::Ridnour reminds me of the old Mark Price.
PhxSunsOwn13::Telfair....? Gulp. Yuck.
MandatoryMadnessInThe763::the guy is timeless, its crazy!  hoping Ricky Rubio is even a little bit like him!!
Forkitout24::Ricky is kinda like Pistol Pete
PhxSunsOwn13::I think he has one more all star type year left in him, then another good, not great year, then he probably calls it quits and ends on a high note. We'll see though, hes like Benjamin Button right now.
Forkitout24::LOL. I actually agree. He will go out on his terms.(Canadian style)
PhxSunsOwn13::My dream lineup next year:  C- Gortat  F- Garnett F- Batum  G- Beal   G- Nash  ------------------------  I think we could talk KG into signing a two year contract to come give it one last run with Nash, we could draft Bradley Beal and then sign Nic Batum to a somewhat big deal, since we have more cap space we could potentially offer him more than what the Blazers could. That is a contender right there, with Frye, Morris, Brooks, Dudley off the bench as well.
Charles74116::Batum ain't goin' nowhere
Forkitout24::I think Ray Allen has 2 years of "shooting" for the Suns.
PhxSunsOwn13::Suns offer him a max Im sure he would.
Forkitout24::You just jinxed yourself
Forkitout24::legit lineup and backups!
MandatoryMadnessInThe763::Id go for Garnett, as long as hes starting he will ball for you im sure....  if the suns get a top 3 pick too that will be money!
PhxSunsOwn13::Yeah we just need Nash to talk KG to playing for us, and then get lucky in the lottery and we are in buisness!
Forkitout24::There are a lot of Suns fans worldwide. Barkley started it. Nash kept it alive.
