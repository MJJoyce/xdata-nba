The Anomaly::On the bright side, maybe Milwaukee will be able to get a top 5 pick in this coming draft.  God knows they need one of those big time talent players that are coming out.  It would be great if Antetokounmpo developed and they got a few high draft picks to work out around him.  Maybe Milwaukee could be pretty good in a few years.  Sorry, probably a bit too early to be thinking like that, but ouch.  Milwaukee looks horrible.
BHK::Really??... Play John Henson already.
Rico M::Hey Thunder.. Listen Up!!!.. Omer Asik wants out of Houston and your sorry excuse of a player in Perkins needs to be dropped.. Why dont you find a way and pick up Asik.. He is 100 times better than Perkins. Agree?
Mickey::Jennings is on a roll in Motown, as Middleton struggles, and Knight rides the pine!

Shane's DJ Service::come on Durant I traded the farm for you lets get some stats.
Joey::Good effort by the Bucks, way to keep it within 20!  It will look good on Sports Center!
Catfish::all you tards need to see the 5 in the PF statbox for henson, that stands for 5 personal fouls, please continue to cry about the coach not playing him 40 mins. lol
Anton::All aboard the Bucks tank
GM::Drew will do anything, and has NOt to play Henson..it's incredible
I State Facts And You Get Mad::Does OKC realize they are basically playing a D League team who is playing on a back to back
