schmoe::Don't understand how an NBA franchise could assemble such a pathetic roster. It's literally 15 role players and not a single player who would start for another team in the league. Jefferson is way past his prime. They've taken tanking to a whole new level in Utah.   The youth argument I keep hearing about is silly, they're going to need to make some huge changes to their personnel over the next 3 years to get back to being competitive.
Kobe For 3.....Clank!::Get the scrubs in already.
chuck d::I live in PGH big Pitt fan , Adams super person and the potential to be a great player. Pitt coach Jamie Dixon underplayed him and he only got a shot most of the time when he got a rebound. He is a raw talent but Dixon did nothing to help him develop; he just needs to play.I am very impressed with his play with OC but certainly not surprised.
Steven McCormick::I always like to root for the underdog, and I will certainly pray for the Jazz, but to be honest this could be another routing much like the one the Clippers dealt the BULLS earlier today.   tsk  tsk
NSkyline57::Jazz looking to be 1-14, even without Westbrook. Starting fwds are Richard Jefferson and Marvin Williams. Now that is just sad. This is not 2007...
clint::Hayward I hope this is not a contract year cause you've got D-league written all over you.
KarlL::The Jazz are well on their way to breaking the 76'ers 9-72 record.
CSONKA_39::Keep tanking Utah
Tommy SoCal::Wow. The Jazz are just terrible. I'll bet some lower division NCAA teams could beat them.  http://espn.go.com/nba/features/worstteams
Drew::Good God the Jazz are the Jaguars of the NBA. No scratch that, the Jags have more wins.
