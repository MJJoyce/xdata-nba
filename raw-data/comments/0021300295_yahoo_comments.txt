James::Brook had a pretty good line.   Needs a few more shots per game, and definitely more rebounds.   seven rebounds is not going to get it done, and he has to give up that perimeter shot.   The only people who want to see that shot are from the other club.   But overall the team slowed it down and pounded it inside, which should be who they are.   By the end of the season they should be able to get Brook 17 or 18 shots per game easy.  Go Nets!!
Barrie::The Nets are going to get it together. The season is still young!
Iron::Finally the Nets are getting out of their own Nets.
PKM::Nets are terrible but the Bucks might be worse.  We shall see
Cyril::Brandon Knight reminds me a lot of Randy Foye.  He's not really a good enough passer to be a point guard, but he's not tall enough or consistent enough to be a shooting guard. When he gets hot, he can knock down some three's and put up a useful stat line, but when he's off, he's almost useless.  I don't think his ceiling is much higher than where he is right now.
Soldier::Such a good player. Is Kidd that bad (apparently) or bad assistants? Or both??
THE REAL DWIGHT::fire him
Steven N.::Bucks #$%$, oh well losses just improve lottery chances
K::brandon knight is a terrible PG
Archie::The kidd needs to grow and learn faster
