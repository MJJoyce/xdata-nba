Aicyla22::u tell him
Djuki 3::all part of a genius master plan to make the Heat rusty and lose
Aint Bout Dis Life::so is that bath salts phase done down there or what?

cbbaseball19::You said zona fresca is a mexican place right? I dont know if thats a good idea!
FtLaudyHeatFan4Life::Besides the obvious MVP choice of Bron and Durant who else deserves I guess the third spot for MVP. For some reason I want to give it to Rondo over Melo, any thoughts?
_Furious_::Chris Paul deserves some consideration.
RunTheBall22._::Melo but Rondo should already have one. thanks lebron butt lovers for jewing Rondo
Djuki 3::so they circumsized Rondo and threw him a bat mitzvah?
Aicyla22::jewing rondo? whats that?
Djuki 3::wow what's with the anti-semitism
Aicyla22::i looked at your pictures and i dont know you, but are you at southport in one of them?

Aint Bout Dis Life::i cant wait that long.
Aicyla22::excellent question
_Furious_::Most frustrating Heat player for Heat fans to watch:  (a) Mario "What the hell were you thinking?" Chalmers  (b) Joel "Please catch the ball Joel!" Anthony  or   (c) Norris "I think I'll drive on a 6'11" guy and get pinned" Cole
FtLaudyHeatFan4Life::CHALMERS!!!
cbbaseball19::B!
brandonlee561heat22::Whats up

_Furious_::Man that keyboard - let me help you again:  "Kobe stole two."
RunTheBall22._::Kobe has two
Aicyla22::** derrick rose sits at home
_Furious_::I think your keyboard is malfunctioning - let me help you:  Lebron "Win finals MVP while Kobe sits at home" James

Aicyla22::dwyanewadeblockedyourfavoriteplayer3.0 are you still here? i have an answer
Aicyla22::okay i guess youre not here anymore, but in case you see this the correct way to say that would be   no one knows what my team is
cbbaseball19::Party tonight at Montaditos in Broward.  Everything is a dollar!
Aicyla22::where is it?
Aicyla22::thats right where zona fresca is!
cbbaseball19::Its inbetween peters and broward blvd.

_Furious_::If they put Zo's talent in Joel's body, wouldn't that just make him...Zo?
Djuki 3::nope, African American
Aicyla22::so hes not haitian?
Djuki 3::During his time at Indian River High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, he led the team to 51 straight victories and a state title his junior year (1987). As a senior he averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocked shots a game
Djuki 3::born in Chesapeake VA
_Furious_::I actually have an autographed picture of Zo - my Godmother used to watch his kids.
Aicyla22::i was going to say Zo is haitian?!?!?

_Furious_::Miami would dominate any team in a 7 game series...except the Bucks....and Wizards...
barcodedlife::And Pelicans
dwyanewadeblockedyourfavoriteplayer3.0::How about a 28 game series?
dwyanewadeblockedyourfavoriteplayer3.0::indeed it does, if not it could end in a tie
Djuki 3::it has to be odd silly
barcodedlife::Wow, epic
barcodedlife::I see lots of teams beating the heat in a one game series.
Djuki 3::this is true
FtLaudyHeatFan4Life::Which of the following will be true for Miami this season?  A: After the regular season the heat will be ranked in the top 5 best defenses. B: Lebron James will be MVP C: D. Wade will AVG at least 25 ppg when healthy. D: The Heat will finish the with the best home record in the NBA. E: Heat will will face the Knicks in ECF and they will take them to 7 games. F: All of the above G: More than one but not all  Vote Now!
FtLaudyHeatFan4Life::If that is the dark side call me Lord Vader cause I have been eatin them fer years
cbbaseball19::Me too buddy me too!
barcodedlife::All false.
_Furious_::Only A.   James will deserve MVP but will not win it.   Wade will not average 25 even when healthy because they don't need him to.  OKC will finish with the best home record.   The Knicks will not make the conference finals.
cbbaseball19::Ft. Laudy we brought Alycia to the dark side!  She is in love with the buffalo and ranch chicken tender sub at publix!
dwyanewadeblockedyourfavoriteplayer3.0::C is improbable with coach Spoelstra as Heat head coach

Djuki 3::ooh yeah i remember that show, i guess i can see the resemblance
Aicyla22::are your gums bleeding?

Djuki 3::try writing a nice poem once in a while
Aicyla22::you trying to lose this one too? haha jk   cb is well behaved
_Furious_::I didn't even think it was that offensive to be honest - maybe a 24 hour suspension... they banned the account lol.
Djuki 3::yeah you can't say anything offensive, you have to be very polite
_Furious_::I'll have to try that.
cbbaseball19::I dont say anything stupid......
Aicyla22::its not that bad i could be rooting for uf.  ucf will be good 1 day
cbbaseball19::Well good thing you didnt follow them!
Aicyla22::everyone from my school went to UF
cbbaseball19::Thats where everyone in my high school and st thomas went.  Its ridiculous.
Aicyla22::yes i went there
cbbaseball19::Im guessing you went there since you have the obligation and also the ucf logo on your favorite teams
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::And this is why it's better that no one knows............
Aicyla22::is this like mad libs?   ... that you're gay? ...that you're a lady?

RunTheBall22._::unlikely but Rose could surprise everyone and make an AP like come back. if that happens with the way Noah is playing and the toughness of this team the heat will be in trouble. better hope not bron bron
_Furious_::Do you really believe that?
Aint Bout Dis Life::Remember when bron bron shut down d rose in 2011 ecf????
Aicyla22::all i see is blah blah blah wah wah wah
cbbaseball19::I would like to congratulate the Miami Hurricanes on stomping UCF in basketball yesterday!  wooooooooohooooooooo
Aicyla22::thats not saying much
Aicyla22::i dont follow ucf sports at all.  ive always been a miami fan but feel obligated to root for ucf
Aicyla22::which is weird considering mj's son was on the team
cbbaseball19::Actually UCF is a solid basketball team. They dont get any attention though...
RunTheBall22._::best thing to happen to the heat is Howard leaving and Rose goin down. the two biggest reason they won last year and have a shot to get back to the finals this year
Aicyla22::wrong! pat riley is the best thing thats happened to the heat
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Run.. I'm not by any means a HEAT fan.. I wish they fail but I won't make enemies because I like another team... try to be cool.. you'll see it's feel gREAAT
Aicyla22::we dont pay him any mind. hes a little pesky at times aka all the time, but it wouldnt be the same without him
RunTheBall22._::i don't need pretend friends on a heat board, i have real ones and only come here to pass some time and talk some ball. find some real friends and you will not feel the need to make them here

Maybe a little bit of jealousy? -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  She don't like me a bit Duro... I threw down my towel.
Aicyla22::i dont mind you and i minded you initially
Aicyla22::youre pretty cool
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::starting to like you, think you are cool... sounds a lot better than "i don't mind you"
Aicyla22::mind is such a small word
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::What does what mean?
Aicyla22::what does that mean?
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::mind is such a small word.
cbbaseball19::PROGRESS!
Djuki 3::sorry man, i tried =/
RunTheBall22._::Kobe with 7 consecutive 30 or more point games. when the last time Wade even played 7 in a row. just sayin, you heat fans need to show a little more respect to the real King
