Cyril::Larry Sanders' totals from the last 3 games - 13 points, 13 fouls, 5 turnovers, ONLY 3 blocks, 5-17 shooting, one technical foul, one flagrant foul, and one locker room altercation.   This is why you don't rush out and give a guy a contract extension just because he suddenly turns it on mid-season and plays 30-35 games of great basketball. You can't ignore the first two-and-a-half seasons of his career when he was basically terrible and couldn't stay on the court for more than 20 minutes because of foul trouble. You also don't overlook the 14 technicals and 5 ejections he racked up last year.   If he doesn't turn things around soon, that $44 million contract is going to be one of the worst in the league.
Fred Derf::Man, the Buck are a mess.  Sanders fouls out with 1 pts ?  Knight takes 21 shots and only makes 5?  Middleton play 29 min with only 3 pts?
Carlo::I like this DJ Augustin! His energy fuels the team! When I was watching the game, I thought I was watching Derrick Rose!! I will be very disappointed if the Bulls will let him go this offseason. I will place Augustin as a 2nd starter for PG behind Derrick Rose. Trade Hinrich for picks so we can rebuild. We need a PF who can shoot 3.
J::Bulls win another meaningless game against another really bad Eastern Conference opponent.  Yawn.  The Eastern Conference is a joke and so the Regular season try-hard teams, like the Bulls, will win plenty of games.    Nobody cares.  It doesn't make them a contender for any title.  Not even close.
mark::Captain Kirk is having another great game! What an awesome shooter!
The Question::Wow,the Bucks must really be bad.
Mr Clean::Total tool is the HC for the Bucks.
andy::Them Bulls deserve all the props in the world.  Countless never-ending injuries and missing tons of key players , losing Deng and they continue to win
Richard::Oops, the Bulls are winning too many games, better trade couple more.
Ron::the bucks are leading.. in fouls haha!
