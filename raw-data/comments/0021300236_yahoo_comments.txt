Mark::Looks like a 2-team race in the Eastern Division and the other 13 teams plus Utah will tank for the 2014 draft.
John H::Yeah I don't see Miami repeating this year-Indiana has the title on lock down.
cj::congrats to the pacers on beating another bad team. the schedule's been pretty easy, thus far (only played 1 team above 500 and that team was only 1 gm above) but that's about to change so far, both heat and pacers played 3 teams from the west difference is all 3 heat opponents have better records than 3 pacers opponents plus, the heat played the only other team in the east with a winning record (hawks) and pacers haven't in the next two weeks, pacers will play best of the best (not the worst of the worst as they have been up to this point)
fcbonilla::This would be a good match-up to watch. Washington's fast paced game against Indiana's defense. This game might be closer than people might expect.
Anton::Typical Indiana home cooking. Wizards 1 FT attempt 1st half.
Gotham::After this game. The next 5 of the 6 will get very gritty for the Pacers. The wild wild west trip Clippers Blazers, Spurs Thunder (Jazz an easy win), & a showdown back home vs the Heat.
Aj Putian::almost Quadruple Double performance by Lance . Pts,Rebs,Asst,TO's
JY::Get that triple double Lance
Gordon::Clippers, Spurs. Blazers, OKC, Heat, we'll find out if they're the real deal or not in the next couple of weeks
Online Tough Guy::It'll be interesting to see when Granger gets backs, or if they trade away Granger for another key addition.
