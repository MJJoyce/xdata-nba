Rab::The ball movement by SA around the 7:30 mark of the 4th quarter was awesome. Adelman should leave some of the "Wolves" behind who I won't name just look at the box score in SA for the purpose of attending some Spurs practices to get a better idea of how to play the game. Who the H is the 'Wolves' defensive coach? They don't seem to have a clue how to guard, leaving their man open for easy shots. The 'Wolves" are a circus of over paid actors trying to act out the game of basketball.
El Jefe MN::What is amazing about watching the game last night was that both teams run basically the same motion offense with high pick and rolls.  One sets solid screens, has players that know how to use and cut off those screens, makes sharp back door cuts....  the other is the TWolves.
Jeff::Boy I am so glad everyone was elated when Ricky Rubio decided to play in the NBA. Wolves sure wouldn't be the same without him.
A Yahoo! User::Shut up, South Park (a.k.a. Bob, Barney, Greg, Davey Crocket, Turd Ferguson, Michael Scott). We all know you hate the Wolves, say the same thing over and over again, and couldn't capitalize a word to save your life. Stay off mommy's computer until you grow a brain cell.
Slip N' Slide::3/4 of the wolves roster is absolute trash. Please stop hyping the wolves people and get a clue.
Dan::Come on Wolves, it's not illegal to win back to back games.
Ron Doe::and Ginobli is the most unorthodox player. Hard to defend the lefty because he flails around everywhere with almost no game plan.
Ron Doe::My Aryan brothers the Wolves will get it together soon and start beating up on these bums. Too many games are rigged against them now.
Ron Doe::The NBA has always kept the Spurs in contention because they want everyone to think that small market teams will thrive. They've chosen the Spurs as their small market symbol, so no one suspects the conspiracy!
Ron Doe::Minnesota's got this.
