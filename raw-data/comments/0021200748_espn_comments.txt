carolinafan976::the bobcats are the worst basketball team in NBA history right now , but they have a good potential players , they just need a clutch shooter , the 4th comes nobody cant score and they take  bad shoots , if the Bobcats get a player like Seth Curry , we will be a lot better 4th quarter team.
pnete::you would think that someone on bobcats would figure out that the second is better tnan the first.
Dev614::Lavoy with 22 rebounds??!! Where the hell did that come from?
arrogantespncommenter9::Being a Cats fan is so depressing. Kemba is a beast, though.
ShakeWellAfterUsing::I'm going to every board to spread the news of Jeremy Pargo.
RZA_CONSOLE::next game he's 1-6
CoreyGallagherArt::6-1, he's going to shoot 600%
bballdon32::Hopefully the Sixers can pull out these next 2 games. And hopefully the Bucks lose their next 2.
YOURE A TOWEL::Lavoy Allen is the best player we've taken in the past three drafts!
CoreyGallagherArt::Um, Holiday...
salemram15::Jrue was 4 drafts ago, last 3 were turner, vuc &amp; lavoy, harkless &amp; moultrie.
ShakeWellAfterUsing::Bobcats have the talent to win games. Win some game, Bobcats!!!
JHCASHION 88.9::no they dont
ShakeWellAfterUsing::Pargo or Scalabrine?
RZA_CONSOLE::why does evan turner always sound like a muppett?
bballdon32::Come on Detroit..... beat the BUCKSSS
ShakeWellAfterUsing::Come on Bobcats win some games!!!!
UnitedStatesSportsRule::12 pts 6 assists and 4 ribbies in 30 mins?  Nothing special, why is he special?
ocbboarder06::He plays in another realm. Those are only the stats they could record.
ocbboarder06::This date will go down as the night Pargo took over the league.  Rules will undoubtedly have to change to be fair for other players.
RZA_CONSOLE::philly needs to replace dee lynum with her husband
IggyIsClutch::GG guys I'm out too cya!
CoreyGallagherArt::I don't know about you guys, but when Doug says Swaggy it makes me happy
Ten1997_Sixers::Exactly
UnitedStatesSportsRule::Welcome The to Wells Pargo Center
LaMarcus Aldridge::Hey FlyGuys, get the Jeremy Pargo SN...
Charlotte Bobcats NBA Champions 2013::<b>The Bobcats are 5 starters away from building a solid championship team</b>
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::In all seriousness though, do we try to trade turner?
IggyIsClutch::If we can get some value
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::like what though? besides tyreke, no one stands out to me
FlyGuys623::aight peace guys. we are seeing history
IggyIsClutch::Cya man
RZA_CONSOLE::mullen is the demise of the bobcats  he's garbage. imagin bismack in practice with mullins
ocbboarder06::Im naming all of my children Pargo followed by numbers.
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::Pargo reminds me of the 2000 AI
iwarner22::More like an 1990 MJ who is also strikingly handsome
FlyGuys623::is it monday yet?
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::what happens monday..?
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::it could be the new lebron vs KD
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::oh right. pargo vs. CP3, what a matchup
FlyGuys623::next pargo ga... i mean sixers game
PATSORGENOS2012::So where is our ESPN hype for Pargo, ala Lin?
CoreyGallagherArt::PARGOMANIA
PATSORGENOS2012::hahahaha
IggyIsClutch::They don't want their website to crash
FlyGuys623::dwight howard eating cereal is a top story, this obviously isnt
LaMarcus Aldridge::Fargo, ND is changing it's name to Pargo.
FlyGuys623::people will actually want to live there now
binkinainteasy::Odds that Bynum plays in February?
PATSORGENOS2012::Watch Doug will play Pargo 3 mins next game
IggyIsClutch::I would forever hate him
jackson0780::THANK YOU SIXERS FANS FOR MAKING THIS ONE EASY
ocbboarder06::Pargo for World King.
PhillyBri99::Pargo's game was a fluke
ocbboarder06::True dat.  Everything ever
iwarner22::You mean king of the universe
DaKing0325_::60 rebounds for philly
Charlotte Bobcats NBA Champions 2013::<b>Is there enough room on the Pargo bandwagon?</b>
FlyGuys623::its still very early in his reign. yes you can
IggyIsClutch::Plenty
UnitedStatesSportsRule::Jeremy Pargo, why are we excited about him?
iwarner22::whats this disrespect towards the great Pargo? You watch your mouth
CoreyGallagherArt::Learn NBA please, lol, this UnitedStates guy...
ocbboarder06::Greatness.  Like Ali, only a basketball genius.
IggyIsClutch::Don't act like you don't know him. He's a legend
FlyGuys623::watch him
CoreyGallagherArt::Chris Paul vs Jeremy Pargo, who you got?
IggyIsClutch::Pargoooooo
FlyGuys623::thats established
LilDwayne21::I can't believe it. Philly has a shot at making a credible playoff run this year. Unbelievable. Bucks better hunker down and maintain their focus,cuz Philly iscreepin' on a comeuppance for that #8 seed.
RZA_CONSOLE::hoilday is the best player by far. but its a poor man's bulls  hawes is not noah  better shooter but so is byron mullens
RZA_CONSOLE::the sixers don't have the 'killer' player to win any playoff series
CoreyGallagherArt::Holiday? Even prior to this season he's played stellar in the playoffs. Also, Bynum in the East is still an unknown, when games become a half court affair as they do in the playoffs he could absolutely dominate
RZA_CONSOLE::if i was the bobcats owner  keep kemba,mkg, trade everyone else
LaMarcus Aldridge::If you were MJ, why not just suit up instead?
UnitedStatesSportsRule::Lavoy Allen looked great vs The BOBCATS. Only the Bobcats thid year.
potato623::He's always looked better at the 4
UnitedStatesSportsRule::I agree, idk why Collins felt the need to shuffle a million times.
potato623::Why now do the Clippers decide to get their whole squad together...terrible timing :(
PhillyBri99::Hey don't leave Lavoy out of this
IggyIsClutch::They all wanted to see pargo
PATSORGENOS2012::Got a much needed win....gotta get rolling.  Maybe if we can squeak in with Bynum, we can at least make it worth watching in round 1.  And if we got the Knicks, the city would be on fire
bluedevils1148::11 of Lavoy's 22 boards were offensive.
Charlotte Bobcats NBA Champions 2013::<b>$@%!...I don't know what to do now</b>
PhillyBri99::His name is a lie
Raiders1377::Bring Larry Brown back to Charlotte? I dunno.
Ten1997_Sixers::Lol
Raiders1377::Nice name, hahaha.
potato623::Chef VoyRD!!
bballdon32::Bynum's been teaching Lavoy how to rebound.
potato623::And to hit an 7-9 spare
ocbboarder06::Pargo fan club sign-up below.
PhillyBri99::Bri
PhillyBri99::U suck
Linda33763::This Fago is in the D league. No team want him. And he is 5 feet tall, on a 10 day contract, with no game. Philly have the worse fans in history. So brag on a loser, like your city. A BIG FRODD.
YOURE A TOWEL::You're a
DaKing0325_::king
PATSORGENOS2012::PATS
IggyIsClutch::Iggy
