WarriorsWarrior::If the shoe is off you must cast off!  -Jarret Jack
Mr. Nut Job::The Warriors are Clipper wannabes.
HK-47.1::That's why the dubs already beat the Clips in L.A.
SFWildcard::If the Warriors want to to be Wannabes , they would want to be Celtics or Lakers wannabes , teams with history of winning not a team with decades of losing like the Clippers
kay-raider::FREE CHICKEN NUGGETS!
jeff050578::If Golden State were in the Eastern Conference they would be a 2-3 seed. Their record now has them tied for 3rd but if the Dubs played in the east they would have a better record because they beat up on east teams(Like most west teams do) not including the Magic
jeff050578::Mark Jackson for CoY.  He has changed the culture in the locker room. They play hard and believe they can win. The last 3 drafts havent hurt us either. Now all we need to do is get Bogut back and hope Beidrins continues to play 10-15 productive foul trouble free minutes until we can shed that large contract.
HK-47.1::The problem i have with Jackson is t he dubs always give up leads. Only once did they not  have a huge let down in the 4th quarter. He also plays way to much small ball, i know they miss bogut but you need to play a center in crunch time. Lee and Landry combo is decent but they get pulverized on the boards. Lee plays much better next to either Festus or Biedrins. Plus i would much rather see Barnes play in crunch time over Thompson.
Kidcudi5193::I was at the game. Haven't been to a game in a couple of months, it  was good to finally see the Warriors live after so long
Drun2400::Those plus/minus numbers are ridiculous. holiday had -60 and curry had +55? wow
rickeye369::Jenkins +55 in 9 minutes, you didnt see the warriors 9 minute run they had?
douchewein8::how is that possible?
oOARaiderOo::Thadeous Young is a G.   GG Phi.
FriscoWarriors415::The game was fun tonight! Saw Jack throw D wrights shoe into the crowd, got free chicken nuggets because of the horrible 76ers FT shooting, and the dubs getting the W. great night
torrtis::Been voting for David Lee for All Stars Weekend. But going by the votes so far, don't think he has a chance. Bay area folks not voting? I'm a Rockets fan.
jeff050578::I have been voting for him. He deserves it.
WarriorsWarrior::Go Warriors!
cxlo::Did someone spill coffee on the +/- machine today?
PartyInTheBackfield::wow 20-10. It really is incredible to be at this point after 30 games. We're so used to being 11-19 at this point or 10-20
Ellis_Curry::he would also take 30 shots to get 25 pts
drat4567::^^ No? Monta ellis would keep them in a lot of games.
FriscoWarriors415::We wouldnt be this good if we still had ellis. He has a low basketball IQ and takes too many shots. Would of traded him for nothing
EL_ABALLARDE::The Ellis effect
FlyGuys623::That lunch clip of Bryz is better than the universe clip
bizplayboy::why did turner sit out the last 5 or 6min of the 4th quarter?
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::Is Orlando the only Eastern Conference team the Warriors lost to?
jeff050578::yes
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::cool :)
supe540::I think so.
dudemanbrohella::warriors are 20-10 baby!!!
IggyIsClutch::Things I got from this game 1. The Kwame and Lavoy front court is probably the best one 2. Doug like small ball way too much 3. Swaggy can take over a game 4 jrue can't handle too much pressure
potato623::This clip is hilarious http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVqbTVa7LBU
EL_ABALLARDE::Kwame got 8 rebounds...something is wrong with the Warriors...
PartyInTheBackfield::Our 7 ft Aussie is hurt. Thats one problem
supe540::kwame solid in his short stint with warriors.  learned to appreciate the guy.
dudemanbrohella::yeah its called boguts injury
FlyGuys623::He is good defensively
FlyGuys623::I would say spencer but I haven't seen Bryz disappoint me in a long time so idk
potato623::Seriously Bryz should have his own TV show
K B Z::Warriors come out and play!!!!!!
cymbalcrasher579::jarret jack outta nowhere having the season of his life...nowhere near what david lee is doing but jesus who saw that coming?
cymbalcrasher579::always been a good player but he's averaging more points and 3's this season than his overall career average...he also blinked during his photo for his espn player card lol
supe540::Jack's had lots of excellent seasons.  Check out his stats.
Leefost::ok bed time, 6am here in the UK lol things i do for my american sports :) goodnight
Leefost::seeya
Leefost::I coach american football for 10 year olds, its taking off over here
PartyInTheBackfield::is it really? Thats interesting to hear. Take it easy man
_Neanderthal Hipster 2.0_::cool !! cheers :)
Leefost::You guys are better athletes period
PartyInTheBackfield::damn you actually like our sports? I thought you guys hate it
FlyGuys623::I don't kno if I hate spencer or Bryz more
SUHperHigh::Bryz, hockey over everything
IggyIsClutch::Hawes definitely. Remember the game he had against Memphis? Look at what he did today
potato623::Gotta love Bryz, at least Spencer isn't scared of bears!
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::omcghee curry a all star, are you kidding ----------------------------------------------------------- not gonna happen.. Chris Paul, Tony Parker, Russell Westbrook, Kobe Bryant are automatic, then Jeremy Lin, James Harden because of the Houston factor
dudemanbrohella::theirs a much better chance for curry because of the warriors record. coach's might vote him in
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::Im NOT saying he's NOT, BUT he's facing what Ellis faced two years ago: A Glut of Guards.  Luckily with Lee, there's NOT enough Quality big men ahead of him.
potato623::The Bryz visited some space exibit place hhaa  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA7ymWx9TD4
potato623::I don't understand a word of this but it's hilarious haha!
FlyGuys623::Such an idiot
FlyGuys623::Bryz smh
IggyIsClutch::At least the Knicks lost
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::2nd best defensive effort ive seen by a Warriors opponent all season.
Leefost::See the lakers won, anyone think they will miss playoffs?
Raiders Godfather333::Nice win Warriors.  Good game Sixers. They were my second favorite team when Dr. J was playing for them. Yes, I know, I am old!
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::With the GLUT of Guards in the Western Conference, I understand IF Steph Curry does NOT make it to the All Star Game, BUT IF David Lee gets left out, that's going to be a snub of Biblical Proportions.  No 4/5 is playing better than Lee this first half in the Western Conference.
tomcghee::curry a all star, are you kidding
Timdiz85::yea, he's played like one besides this game
Timdiz85::Yup!
tomcghee::16 fourth quarter points, really. home court and they play like they are out of shape
FriscoWarriors415::Still got the W. Isnt that what matters?
IggyIsClutch::At least we have the flyers...oh wait Dammit!
SUHperHigh::Still waiting for my season tickets it sucks
floyd_131::hopefully the Phillies have a better run with the recent trades
potato623::Did you hear about Bryz haha?
IggyIsClutch::Lol
potato623::A russian reporter wrote an article on him saying he looked like he was is space playing and he told the reporter he wasn't talking to him because he is a space cosmonot or something like that, funny as hell
IggyIsClutch::What happened? Is he sucking
FlyGuys623::NAh
FlyGuys623::It stinks
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::reasonably good job despite being lousy in the second half. Steph can't have too many nights like this. Win's a win though.
douchewein8::jrue will be all defense one day
SB4LlFE::at least curry didn't force shots like he would on a bad day
potato623::Jrue shut him down, luckily Jrue pulled his inner donovan mcnabb on offense tonight for the Warriors
potato623::Shot 20 3's, what the hell
FlyGuys623::Lol @ all these gamblers
cjoconn82::LOL @ the dude who dresses up his dog
IggyIsClutch::Lol @ the dude with a bad comeback
FlyGuys623::U r so mad haha
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::Still waiting on the Jesus reference by David Lee
HtownTiger225::i hate jrue holiday. damn him.
ballerbooboo::nick young didnt want to cover...seriously a FAR 3?? you couldve got a better shot. holiday set up a horrible pass ruined the back door
AINOKEALLBUSUFAKAWOT::LOL must feel even better after I made you think the cover was a lost cause =D
Leefost::FU! -5.5 :(
smk5002::refs in nba r the absolute worst. words dont even describe
smk5002::nobody bets teams in the nba. they bet the shady lines
smk5002::nba is way worse. i agree the nba is the WWE
Leefost::NFL refs basically call holding for nothing all the time
PartyInTheBackfield::and NBA refs call a foul for just playing defense
PartyInTheBackfield::they are. They make the NBA like the WWE
Leefost::not as bad as NFL buddy
Igglesnation::GG dubs fans,  we gotta win tomorrow
AINOKEALLBUSUFAKAWOT::wooot they covered!
Leefost::lol loser
JZ I loathe ESPN Alvarado::All I gotta say is THAT im glad for the Win and glad this Brutal game didn't GO into Overtime
direwolf748::$@% the celtics
DaKing0325_::This loss is on Collins and Holiday
chuckeezy::Surely.

bballdon32::Lol @ Philly Coaches..
