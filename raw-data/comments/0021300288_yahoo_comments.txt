Chris M::Solid, well configured, deep, young, athletic, and hungry to win group of players.  I said in the off-season when they were working free agency and the draft this team almost had two starting groups of five and would be at worst a #5 seed.  Despite the great start and awesome play it will be hard to maintain this rate of winning and they may slip to 2nd in the division but they are still a #5 seed at worst in a very, very strong Western conference.  If they can get the #1 or 2 seed we may very well see them and Indiana banging heads in the Finals.  Everyone get on the RIP RIDE - GO BLAZERS!
Tony::I am excited to see McCollum returning in a month or so. He will bring more offensive punch from the bench. Hopefully he will get playing minutes.
Justin P::Excited to see Thomas Robinson find a place where he can contribute and improve. Rockchalk Jayhawk!
