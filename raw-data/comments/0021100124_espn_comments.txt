UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::I miss having Matthews on the JAZZ!!! For a Blazer fan who would you rather have Wallace or Matthews? Why? You can only pick 1.
Tha L3GEND::Wallace for now ... Matthews in 2 - 3 years ...
blazers13inarow::Matthews, because he is one of the best shooting guards in the league.
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::I think it is a toss up right now. But for the future I would say Matthews. What a stud though....undrafted!!! Wallace is a beast though! The Blazers have a lot of good years ahead of them.
Matthew85633::Wallace because he represents the state of Alabama.
rockndoc3::NICE! I fell asleep with the Cavs only two points behind.   I thought we were going to have a problem, but it all worked out.   I thought for sure they should send Kyrie and Tristen down to the D League, but Jamison stepped up tonight.  We need to be losing these games that we are supposed to lose!   Cavs need to suck just enough to let The Devil get us Harrison Barnes.
NorthNorth10100::kyrie Irving is sick
RayKrebbs1978::I don't the result of this game was much of a surprise.  The cavs are getting better, but they are not that good yet that they could expect to go into Portland and win in the Rose garden.  Check this out - http://www.lakecounty-sentinel.com/index.php?p=51_9
Kobelies247::GreaT players dont let their teams lose by 30 to the suns!

Kobelies247::Griffin is 100 times the man LA will EVER BE!
Kobelies247::This team is no different from years past....Beat bad teams at home lose to good teams away!
blazers4lyf::he's a cry baby craving for yogurt! hahaha
Antsea91::He's a typical no-life hater that needs to put others down to feel better about himself.
blazers4lyf::and why the hate dude?lol
Kobelies247::not a laker fan idiot! Learn to read
blazers4lyf::your team (lakers) lose to a BAD team away! how was it? you barely won against warriors. who sucks eh?!
blazers4lyf::and your lakers lose to kings?? hahahaha you suck!
blazers4lyf::mad bro? hahahha
dankfranks_155::Good bounce back win for em. They were awful in PHX.
Kobelies247::Thats because they suck
Kobelies247::A good team would of scored 100!
blazers3333333::would have* re $@%!
dankfranks_155::Wow
speakmemory::I guess the Blazers are good again.  Lakers fan here.
MNwildBB::I didn't know that the Blazers were going to be this good. The NW is a really solid conference this year!
gopheyboy::Stop trollin bro lol
Kobelies247::They beat the cavs idiots!!!
PortlandBlazers1004::Division*
rromero076::I've been a long time blazer fan. This team has surprised me as far as the good start but still am not sold until there is more consistancy. They have a veteran group and have enough depth to wear teams down especially with the shorter schedule which you would think be in there favor. Even though they had a nice lead towards the end of the game, the blazers seem like they still struggle going a long period of time without making shots which killed them in the Phoenix game. As the season progresses hopefully they improve in that area and see how they fare with back to backs.
DucksRUNPac12::In other news, lamarcus has come out strong this year, he's scoring alot of points. I just hope nate doesn't wear him out come playoff time.
samuel_97355::not as funny as your username
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::LOL but it's funny.
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::I hope LaMarcus doesn't get Oden'd and have to pull a Roy.
PortlandBlazers1004::Too far.
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::Like this comment if you think I'm j/k with the username.
LeBronIsNumBerOne::<b> <i> <u> OH SHIIITTT</u></i></b>
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::And a few years back, you probably idolized LBJ. Heh, how time flies!
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::#6
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::My mom's dead, bro...
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::I'm pretty sure even LeBron will get a ring before you do, "King" George.
KingGeorge53::Since your mom is dead, you need some guidance.    I'm being polite by telling you to go to bed.
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::I'm sorry, but who are you to tell me what to do? That's what I thought.
KingGeorge53::then show a little respect and go to bed.
KingGeorge53::I"m pretty sure your mom wants her lap top back.
ctownbrown16::alright fuck it... done fighting.. lol good game portland... you had our number! go on a run this year! i am pulling for you in the west... FUCK LA!!!
samuel_97355::I know what you're saying though...traditional fans who pull for their cities team are more genuine and have a sense of respect while the bandwagon homers are wannabe elitists with zero entitlment and no parents
KingGeorge53::cya next game ctown.     Can't believe the crap I've seen today from these Portland "fans".
DucksRUNPac12::How do fans not talk trash? Thats part of the game. Its just to what extent do you say enough is enough.
PortlandBlazers1004::'fans' don't really trash talk. It's probably heat bandwagoners...
KingGeorge53::Yupp.   I've spent some evenings with a few myself.   I guess we just got lucky and got the kids staying up late in grandma's basement tonight.
ctownbrown16::I know some true portland fans... they are all cool... most of these losers were just cleveland haters i assume
PortlandBlazers1004::Thanks.
PortlandBlazers1004::All no-defense team Thoughts? Derek Fisher Kevin Martin Carmelo Griffin Amare
KingGeorge53::I think that's what she means.    Her list is made up of band defenders.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Fisher needs to retire. Derrick Rose made him look terrible.
SlSU28::Does anyone here like Ron Paul?
blazers13inarow::he sucks
jaijames::yes
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::I dont know how I feel about him. Im pretty nonpartisan. If I had to pick a Republican candidate it would be him.
PortlandBlazers1004::Palin!
MeadBucky::He is ok
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::RICK PERRY
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::In other news, the Blue Jackets are now on. Such a sad franchise.
ctownbrown16::LOL that is OLD news
LeBronIsNumBerOne::<sub> <sub> <b> "WHO WANTS TO GO TO CLEVELAND, U DONT HEAR ANYBODY SAYING THEY WANT TO GO TO CLEVELAND!" -NOAH</b></sub></sub>
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::Says the guy who's writing in all-caps.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::To the best of my knowledge Lebron is #6.
KingGeorge53::What's a tramp stamp?
Theclekid89::WIlling to bet you got a LeBron tramp stamp that says "property of LBJ" huh?
KingGeorge53::butthurt for what?
LeBronIsNumBerOne::<b> U MAD BRO HAHAHAHAHA BUTTHURT CAVS FAN</b>
SlSU28::Dont know why there is all this hate, but lets get one thing straight...  Portland and Cleveland gonna play for the 2014 National Championship  Portland MVP - LaMarcus Aldridge Cleveland MVP - Irving
ctownbrown16::shit? LOL im just kiddin bro
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::Natty Light, perhaps?
KingGeorge53::What's a Natty?
KingGeorge53::ok    never heard it, but thanks.
MeadBucky::probably national championship
SlSU28::National championship
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::SOH MAH LEE UH
SlSU28::I never said that $@%!...
ctownbrown16::you started it... "SOMALIA" LMFAO
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::I hope by some strange power of God the Kings make the playoffs so we get their pick.
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::The Kings having the WORST record in the NBA? You just complimented the Nets and Wizards with that comment.
DucksRUNPac12::Your stretching it there. New coach, the team is full of ball hogs, they don't play like a team. They will have the worst record in the NBA.
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::The west is looking weak this year. If the Queens get a little lucky, they might get an 8th seed and get Sanduskied by KD, Westbrick and the Choklahomo City F--kers.
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::Somalia &gt; Cleveland  YEEEE
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::It's called having fun. At least people are agreeing with me. No one likes trolls.
ctownbrown16::well you're just a troll... no one cares about your troll opinion
ctownbrown16::"rather live in Somalia than Cleveland" GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE LMFAO!!!1
BillOntario-341.0::Sorry for spamming guys i just have no friends
ctownbrown16::funny i was thinking Portland fans were humble and respectful... but after looking at some of your comments i was WRONG... MY GOD YOU PEOPLE ARE DUMB
DucksRUNPac12::When it gets dished, portland fans dish it back. But by all means when intelligent fans come in to have a good convo then we can have a intelligent conversation.
ctownbrown16::usually how it goes bro... i just sense more tension from you guys
KingGeorge53::It was good for about 1 hour earlier today.
DucksRUNPac12::You know, if Cleveland had a bona fide star, it would make kyrie that much better....he needs a really good big guy.
KingGeorge53::Tristan is very good around the basket and has a nice mid-range jumper.     He's also got some leaps on the D side of the ball.   "Get that weak stuff outta here."
DucksRUNPac12::Haven't seen much of him, seems as though his build is similar to lamarcus, isn't he from texas also?
KingGeorge53::Tristan is not a SF.   He's PF.    LeBron is one of those tweener players.
DucksRUNPac12::thats what i thought.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::UNC. I hate to say it but he is built kinda like Lebron. He should be a solid SF which we need.
MeadBucky::Tristan is from Texas Longhorns
Theclekid89::UNC
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::I would like Harrison Barnes personally
DucksRUNPac12::He'll be a beast.....
KingGeorge53::Tristan will be that.    Cleveland needs a SG, SF and a C
KingGeorge53::NOt really.     Anderson, Sessions, Gee are three I'd like to see kept.
PortlandBlazers1004::Pretty much a whole new team outside of Kyrie and Tristan?
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::LEBRON IS BETTER THAN KOBE WHO IS BETTER THAN MIKE. I WIN
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::Eh?
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Congrats on the win.

MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::LEBRON WHAT? MOFO
Theclekid89::brandon roy
BasketBalljon3s::Hey you brought up the past so I obliged lol. I have faith, and I think most people would agree that the Blazers will. Not many teams in the West at this point that look like they can hang but we'll see.
Theclekid89::hanging the hat on the ole 77 trophy huh? Ahhh the glory days.... Maybe you can make it out the first round this year huh?
BasketBalljon3s::ha well at least we have one to your none. so congrats again. and btw, it'll be a lot sooner than you'll get one, if ever.
Theclekid89::Let me know when y'all pick up a ring. Don't worry, i'll wait....
BasketBalljon3s::better than not making the playoffs, congrats.
Theclekid89::only to lose in what, the first round. congrats..
BasketBalljon3s::Difference is, we're still winning. awwww.
Theclekid89::greg oden
KingGeorge53::Nice!
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Clever.
PortlandBlazers1004::The last Blazers thread was more interesting than this, and it was all dick talk. Blazer fans+Suns fans= One hell of a funny board.
KingGeorge53::please go back to that board.   this one would clear up in a hurry.
SlSU28::I actually like Cleveland, they are my second favorite team jeesh. I like their uniforms and Irving is gonna be a beast
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::They need to go back to blue and orange. Just sayin.
SlSU28::Yeah i think so too!
MeadBucky::Scott should play him more
PortlandBlazers1004::Portland&gt;Cleveland. End of story.
ctownbrown16::no shit look at the scoreboard dumb fuck my baby cousin could figure out Portland&gt;Cleveland after the final score LOL
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::You guys have a huge advantage in MLB and NFL success...oh wait.
KingGeorge53::Good.   Now go to bed like a good little boy.
MeadBucky::Neither city should be talking  http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/02/0226_miserable_cities/2.htm
PortlandBlazers1004::Mainly because of the depressing weather.
58rhodes::Like most lists its only addressing one 1 10th of 1 percent of the population
LBJisbetterthanKBandMJ::THUMBS UP IF YOU AGREE WITH MY USERNAME
convolutedthought::thumbs down
SlSU28::Why are Cleveland fans talking so much crap, even though their team just loss, who cares. There are still 60 something game left so dont worry about it folks...
ctownbrown16::seriously! you cleveland haters started it LOL
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Go live in Somalia since its better than Cleveland.
KingGeorge53::What crap?
KingGeorge53::Sis, why are you showing a page of Portland as the worst city in the world?   I've always thought that Portland was a pretty good city.
MeadBucky::I'm not a Cleveland fan
SlSU28::KingGeorge53   "   http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/02/0226_miserable_cities/2.htm   "
58rhodes::I was on this board before the game started, and in my 5 yrs on here Ive never seen such @$$ holes
PortlandBlazers1004::That's what I was saying. I thought Cavs fans were classy. But I was wrong.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Than you have never been on a Laker, Knicks, or any New York teams board.
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::ALL THE "GOOD" TEAM BOARDS ARE FULL OF SPAM, SO IM HERE.
PortlandBlazers1004::No wonder I never see you on Knick boards since you don't go on good team boards.
PortlandBlazers1004::I'm as much of a try hard as Carmelo is a defensive player.
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::YOU A TRYHARD?
ctownbrown16::funny how cleveland haters are still thinking we are sour about lebron... i like team players who like to play in the 4th quarter... lol people are so ignorant... i know we all root against the heat naturally... but i never hear anybody crying about... you cleveland haters are the ones that need to "get over it" LOL
epickylesimms::EVERYONE WANTS TO WIN YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD AT YOUR JOB TO DO IT
ctownbrown16::LOVE our owner... he wants to win
KingGeorge53::I know this is going to be hard for you to understand this, but since he bought the Cavaliers, "his" record is better than the collective record of Portland.   Now go to bed.
perrypete::lol doing a great job!
epickylesimms::WHO IS YOUR BEST PLAYER AGAIN? HICKSON???
perrypete::lmao yeah he's not a team player!  and you call someone else ignorant!  and judging by this comment you are sour about him leaving, which you should be mad about the job dan gilbert is doing!
Theclekid89::??? why would you be mad with Dan Gilbert? dude brought us the No. 1 pick (Irving) by trading Mo Williams and then brought in Tristian Thompson. Last time i checked, there 2 of the best rookies playing if not the best. The guy isn't afraid to open up his checkbook either. Believe me, nobody in Cleveland is upset with him.
perrypete::to someone with your education!
perrypete::exactly!
ctownbrown16::LOL huh??? your comment made absolutely NO sense
KingGeorge53::Dan Gilbert is loved in Ohio.
KingGeorge53::So true.
perrypete::cleveland is classless!
ctownbrown16::you're intelligent
perrypete::point proven!
PortlandBlazers1004::But real talk. If you guys think the Thunder could take us in a 7 game serious, you need some help. Because Durant would get Sanduskied by Wallace and Batum. I don't see them winning unless he puts on at least 15 pounds of muscle.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Wow. I feel bad for you sir.
epickylesimms::SANDUSKIED....NICE
epickylesimms::IRVING IS THE FUTURE...............MAYBE NEXT LEBRON

mbeckurr::i dont have their numbers
PortlandBlazers1004::Ask the almost 4 mill people living here.
58rhodes::lol
KingGeorge53::Wanted to talk basketball, but I see the only ones in here are the classless fans of Portland and a few heat fans.    To the real fans of Portland, if any left, best wishes to you and your team.    Go Cavaliers!
SlSU28::Wanted to talk basketball, but I see the only ones in here are the classless fans of Cleveland and a few heat fans. To the real fans of Cleveland, if any left, best wishes to you and your team. Go Portland!
KingGeorge53::well played.    Except you fail to realize the purpose of what I did.   I hope a real Portland fan schools you.
58rhodes::get out
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::If your team is playing the Cavs: 1. You MUST bring up Lebron atleast 10 times per quarter. 2. You must bring up how Cleveland is a crap city even tho you have probably never been there.
SlSU28::http://scaredmonkeys.com/2010/08/07/10-worst-places-to-live-in-america-cleveland-detroit-las-vegas-miami-among-many/  There's our proof
