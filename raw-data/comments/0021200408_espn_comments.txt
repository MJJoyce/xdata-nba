ewwthatsmell::The east is just so weak it is pathetic.  Heat get to walk through a field of dandies and the Thunder have to fight off the wolves at every turn.  LeBron never won a final after a full season.
Dawan208::Knicks too!
NewcastleFanVL::Would you prefer to have Melo or Harden on your team ?
Dawan208::Of course Harden!!!
H-Town Dream Shake::Harden.

npse6636::Can anybody tell me who decides what teams to play on Xmas day? Who decided Rox to play on Xmas? Thet could easily pick Spurs/Grizz/Wolves.
Dezagcoog::the league head offices. Y'know those people who make the schedule every year.
JCDish::Any one know if Royce White will return to the Rockets ... to atleast have some kind of an impact?
H-Town Dream Shake::He will be practicing this week with the orginazation.
NewAges::Rockets should test Royce White in some home game first,before making any further commitment.
rEdBuLxTaSy::HE'LL NEVER BE AN IMPACT...AS LONG AS HIS ANXIETY ISSUES ARE NOT TREATED :):):)
WOOPZZZ::you're back! hows them kids?
JCDish::If this guy can iron out his health issues he could really bring something worth while for Houston.
Seskatchewan::J. Lin is like Javale McGee. Has too many up and down rollercoaster games... both great players though
2LikeABoss6::McGee is an idiot. Lin is smart.
ScrewedUpTexan713::I remember a Bulls fan telling me Asik is gonna be garbage for the Rockets ...LOL wonder if he still thinkin that
ChalupaBatmanMcAsterisk::Those Bulls fans got to see first hand last night.
ChalupaBatmanMcAsterisk::Those Bulls fans werent very smart. I figured he would play great for them. He always played well coming off the bench for the Bulls. His hands are kind of weak but overall he is a good player.
JCDish::I bet the Bulls wish they had let go of Boozer instead of Asik LOL
tharle1956::Asik should still be a Bull
JCDish::-the entire Bulls organization
NewAges::Loser fans just proved their iq below 2 year old
JCDish::I see, thats' pretty good, but is it me or is that Royce White on that pic of the bill-board?
JCDish::i'll check it out
NewAges::Go to Google search Rockets New Age
JCDish::to be honest no I didn't, just haven't payed attention much to the Rockets marketing terms
NewAges::if you don't know what is the New Age? Thats the latest Rockets marketing term
JCDish::... by 23
JCDish::are you a bulls fan or what? are you just cranky cause the bulls lost?
bengalsrgay43034::lol @ bulls
Seskatchewan::Jeremy Lin had a double double last night......
JCDish::Wow, Rex Walters is half japanese.
nba is the worst::Rockets blowing out the east
Seskatchewan::Delete your ESPN account NewAges
Dezagcoog::I love how Ride just keeps burning you and then you try to come back and it sounds like the comeback of a little kid.   well...well...you sound like a child!
Dawan208::Such 2 year olds
NewAges::with 2 year old brain dad....sound about right
ThanksForTheRide::Don't you make me take your toys away!
NewAges::lol.....sure Ride
NewAges::you sound like adult with 2 year old brain
ThanksForTheRide::I have a 2 year old kid.  He's smarter than you.
NewAges::lol.....sure anyone can say it...but do it is the problem
ThanksForTheRide::agreed.  now go do it and delete your account.  adults are talking here.
NewAges::lol.....Thank4aride....calling name make you smarter?
ThanksForTheRide::pretty much everyone is smarter than you.
NewAges::Why? because I am telling the truth?
Seskatchewan::Talk about his game all you want, just stop bringing up he's asian
ThanksForTheRide::no because you're being an idiot.
NewAges::Think about it.....Asian only has 5% of US population, Asian in Asia, many do not read English nor they can access English sites. So the only real reason the media keep use Lin's name to stir up the racism, hatred so the media sell their hits to the haters...
ThanksForTheRide::Lin is Asian?
JCDish::@ Dezagcoog  MY BAD, you're right. How could I forget about YAO MING, sorry everyone ... oh and Yi Jianlian. But to support my previous comment, what I was thinking was Jeremy Lin balling at his position, thats my main point on that. Yao Ming played center, Yi Jianlian plays forward ... but Jeremy Lin is a point gaurd.
Dezagcoog::well I totally agree. No one cares about his race except these crazy fans.
Dezagcoog::Well Yi was terrible. And to be honest Lin hasn't proven anything yet. when he gets consistency and diversity in his game we can call him great. so far he's a good player with potential. I really like him and I'm happy he's here. I think he's smart enough to realize his potential but lets see if he actually does it.
JCDish::And it plays into the main point of my first comment, that It's NOT ABOUT RACE, It's ABOUT BASKETBALL skill and talent.
JCDish::Jeremy Lin is showing that race is not an issue in basketball. Whether you're from Europe, India, Africa, Australia, Asia, Antarctica ... you name it, if you got skills and work hard you can make it to the NBA and show that you can ball with the rest.
JCDish::It's all about basketball, Lin is represents the asian population, AND who can remember the last time an asian basketball player made it to the NBA and could play like Jeremy Lin, nope can't. So Jeremy Lin is doing something no other Asian player has ever been able to do, it's that simple.
Dezagcoog::Yao was the best center in the league for YEARS. Made the all-star team for  years. Kicked Howard's $@% CONSTANTLY. THATS the last time. Not too long ago,
Dezagcoog::WHAT???? I don't know, just this one little guy named YAO MING. WHO ACTUALLY WAS BORN IN CHINA!!! hmmmm lololol how delusional are you people. You don't even know a single thing about basketball...
Seskatchewan::Lin represents the asian population well. agreed. people talk about his bball skills though, noobs talk about his race
Quang6864::Lin a Harvard grad, go get your money bro!
NewAges::According to a lot of haters, Lin gets attention because he is Asian....
Dezagcoog::Haven't heard a single hater say that, what I have heard is a bunch of Lin worshippers claim he is hated cause he's asian....hmmm interesting
Dezagcoog::yeah they use his name to stir up racism. instead they should talk about him by saying the guy with the really dark hair and is the pg for the rockets. Y'know cause names aren't meant to be used when talking about someone...LOLOLOL wow delusional
rEdBuLxTaSy::MY RESPONSES HOLDS WEIGHT UNLIKE YOURS SO HOW CAN I USED MY OWN WORDS AGAINST MYSELF?   GEE, YOU'RE THE IDIOT HERE, WHO HAS TO PLAGIARIZED SOMEONE'S WORDS CAUSE YOU GOT BURN LOL :):):)
Dezagcoog::OMG I LOVE IT!! you're sooo dumb I use your own words against you and that's all you can say!!! LOL love it when a person burns themselves
rEdBuLxTaSy::HAHA HOW SMART!  I SHOULD BE CLAPPING FOR A TROLL WHO FIGURED OUT HOW TO COPY/PASTE HAHAHAAHA :):):)
Dezagcoog::HAHA when you can't respond in kind, you resort to picking someone on their posts. HAHA what a joke you are after shooting yourself in the foot LOL :) :) :)
rEdBuLxTaSy::PLEASE REMIND ME WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU POST SOMETHING INTELLIGENTLY?  THAT'S A RARITY @ESPN NOWADAYS.  WELL AT LEAST YOU EXPOSED YOURSELF FOR BEING THE TROLL MASTER YOU ARE :):):)
Dezagcoog::LOL i did respond in kind sir, you didn't the first time. oh man I love when people call themselves out.
rEdBuLxTaSy::HAHA WHEN YOU CAN'T RESPOND IN KIND, YOU RESORT TO PICKING SOMEONE ON THEIR TYPING.  HAHA WHAT A JOKE YOU ARE AFTER SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT LOL :):):)
Dezagcoog::and why are you typing in all caps as if you didn't know that normal speech patterns and punctuation didn't exist!! Now that delusional for you   LOL see I can also claim something weird and random about you to call you what you just said....LOLOLOL
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND WHY ARE YOU MAKING HIS FANS SUCH A BIG DEAL?  AS IF ANY OTHER TYPICAL BLACK NBA PLAYERS DOESN'T HAVE FAN FAVORITES.  LOL WOW NOW'S THAT DELUSIONAL FOR YOU :):):)
Seskatchewan::Everybody is overpaid in professional sports, Linsanity and his 25 games or so is the cause of his discussion. and him playing well with Harden. NOT being asian... fool
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS INSISTED HE'LL NEVER BE AN ABOVE AVERAGE PG IN THE LEAGUE AFTER JUST 50+ GAMES AS A STARTER BECAUSE THEY THINK HE'S ASIAN AND CAN'T GO LEFT.  NOW THAT'S DELUSIONAL RACISM AT ITS BEST.
Seskatchewan::nah, i'd say the Lin controversy is surrounded by "Lin-sanity" and his huge contract,  not that many people bring up him being Asian
rEdBuLxTaSy::GEE, SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE NOT RACIST?  SERIOUSLY YOU NEED TO GET YOUR HEAD EXAMINE IF THAT'S THE CASE.  YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER TROLL WHO LOVE TO BE SELECTIVE AND BASH THE LIN FANS WHILE THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS GETS A PASS.  TRYING TO SOUND ALL GROWN UP AND SH.IT...NOW THAT'S HILARIOUS. :):):)  BTW, I'M A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN SO IT'S FUNNY YOU'RE TRYING TO CALL SOMEONE A LOSER.  I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISE IF YOU'RE THE BUM AROUND HERE. :):):)  P.S.  YAO HAD HATERS TOO SO KEEP PRETENDING EVERYBODY LOVES YAO :):):)
Dezagcoog::typo is when you misspell something. You sir are a giant brain fart. You're a moron. All you proved is that you can't even look three posts up to see what you wrote, let alone remember it. Mean what you say and say what you mean. Your life is going to mean nothing if you blame everything on racism. Yao had no haters. EVERYONE loved him. Grow a pair then come to the big boy table. When you do. Tell me and we can have an adult discussion where you don't blame everyone on other people and racism. LOL loser
rEdBuLxTaSy::OKAY SO I'LL ADMIT THAT'S A TYPO BUT AGAIN YOU CANT SAY YAO DIDN'T HAVE HATERS FROM THE GET-GO AS WELL.  SO THAT PROVES MY POINT, HATERS GONA HATE REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY PLAY BECAUSE RACE DOES PLAY A ROLE IN IT.:):):)
Dezagcoog::rEdBuLxTaSy - EVERYBODY DOUBTED YAO EVEN BEFORE HE SETS HIS FOOT IN THE NBA BUT HE PROVED THEM HATERS WRONG.  AND LIN IS GETTING THE SAME TREATMENT BUT WORSE BECAUSE HE'S NOT 7'6".  SO YEA STOP OVERREACTING TO MY POST AS IF I'M YOUR BF LOL  :):):)    yeah I don't see the word "EVERYBODY" in there at all HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
rEdBuLxTaSy::LEARN HOW TO READ FOOL.  I NEVER SAY "EVERYBODY" HATED YAO BUT HE DID HAVE HIS SHARE OF HATERS.  AND I NEVER SAY LIN WAS THE BEST PG IN THE LEAGUE BUT THAT HE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE ONE SINCE HE HASN'T EVEN HIT HIS CEILINGS YET.  GEE, FOR A GUY WHO TALKS TOUGH, YOU'RE REALLY LOUSY IN COMPREHENDING SENTENCES. :):):)
Dezagcoog::thats not what you said. you said everyone hated Yao, no one did. You never said any of that. and you're calling me delusional? you've constantly said lin is the best and everyone is keeping him down cause he's asian. Grow a pair and back up what you say. Mean what you say and say what you mean...
rEdBuLxTaSy::LIKE I SAY YAO'S 7'6" SO HE WAS A BEAST.  LIN IS JUST ANOTHER PG WHO HAD TO PROVE HIS WORTH OVER AND OVER  SO PLEASE STOP BEING SELECTIVE AND DELUSIONAL AT THE SAME TIME :):):)
Dezagcoog::yeah sure they did, that's why he was drafted number one overall. LOL I actually lived through it all. EVERYONE was singing his praises and saying how great he is. Come to reality soon please.
rEdBuLxTaSy::EVERYBODY DOUBTED YAO EVEN BEFORE HE SETS HIS FOOT IN THE NBA BUT HE PROVED THEM HATERS WRONG.  AND LIN IS GETTING THE SAME TREATMENT BUT WORSE BECAUSE HE'S NOT 7'6".  SO YEA STOP OVERREACTING TO MY POST AS IF I'M YOUR BF LOL  :):):)
Dezagcoog::yeah it's the name you moron, that's why everyone hated Yao Ming too...oh wait no one did, and no one hates Lin. You just overreact whenever someone says something about your boyfriend.
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND 90% OF THE BUMS IN THE LEAGUE ARE OVERRATED/OVERPAID BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.  OH I GET IT, IT'S CAUSE THEIR LAST NAME IS NOT LIN :):):)
NewAges::I just stated the facts..otherwise, I don't see why the media keep use Lin name whether he is doing good or bad
JCDish::The media keeps talking about Kobe, so are you gonna break out the race card every time the media uses Kobe's name. C'mon bro calm down.
bobbydagreat::The media uses most NBA players names when talking about their teams....
Seskatchewan::you do realize your now the only one bringing race into things with all your posts, right?
rEdBuLxTaSy::PLEASE YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER TROLL STICKING UP FOR THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS.  IF YOU HAD ENOUGH SENSE, YOU WOULD KNOW MOST OF THEIR POST ARE ABOUT LIN'S RACE :):):)  P.S. KEEP DENYING IT...AS IF THAT'LL CHANGE THE FACTS :):):)
Dezagcoog::No one needs to admit that, he said EXACTLY the opposite. You "fans" are the ones bringing race into it, not the haters. Can't you read?
rEdBuLxTaSy::WELL YOU HAVE TO ADMIT MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE MAKING HIM A BIG DEAL BECAUSE OF HIS RACE SO HIS FANS ARE JUST RESPONDING IN KIND TO THE RACISM :):):)
bbears88::Good to see a game live yesterday in person. I was surprised how much a force in the middle Asik is compared to last year. He simply outworked and outplayed Noah. Bulls couldn't get stops, and had no offense except for Nate in the second half of the game. I like both teams, and the only disappointment was it was a blowout--not a competition.  Despite the loss, I think the Bulls will bounce back tonight against the Pacers.  However, I wonder how much juice in the tank the Rockets have left against the Wolves tonight.
Clutch 5000::This 8 man rotation will catch up to the Rockets tho. Mchale needs to better distribute minutes but its tough with our bench being bad
H-Town Dream Shake::Actually they have a good bench compared to most.
Dezagcoog::As the youngest team in the league, more than enough.
npse6636::finally the posts are over 5000+. I think it is bcz of LIN.    To be honest, he is a very good player. But to be a great player, we still have to wait and see.  But the attention he is getting now is unbelievable.  Just hope he keeps improving.
npse6636::Be fair, he is still getting a lot of attention.  But the bottom line is he has to keep playing well.
rEdBuLxTaSy::THAT'S LITERALLY ALL A LIN FAN COULD ASK FOR...JUST HOPING HE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE HIS GAME DOWN THE STRETCH.  LIKEWISE TO THE HATERS, ANY SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT IS ANOTHER SLAP TO THEIR FACE AND THEY WILL CONTINUED TO STIR UP THE POT, BY INJECTING RACE INTO IT AT THEIR CONVENIENCE WHEN ALL OTHER EFFORTS FAILED :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::OH YOU MEAN HOW CHAMLERS/COLE COMBINED FOR 6 PTS, 5 AST 5 TO'S AGAINST LIN THIS SEASON LOL?!  :):):)  GO AWAY TROLL :):):)
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::Jeremy Lin got shut down by Mario Chalmers lolol
NewAges::Lin is not get attention but hatred and racism from the haters.
NewAges::Rocket stars maybe &lt; other teams stars but Rockets can beat any team since they play team game not individual ISO game
Dezagcoog::there aren't that many teams with 4 potential all stars. don't totally agree
rEdBuLxTaSy::HOPING THEY KEEP PLAYING THAT WAY FOR YEARS TO COME :):):)
crumandforster::Rockets are 11-2 out of conference and 4-10 in conference. They should request a transfer...
ryan.arnold936::Great win for the Rockets
rEdBuLxTaSy::LIN FANS :  LIN IS AN ABOVE AVERAGE PG  OBSESSED LIN HATERS:  NO WAY, HE'S JUST AN AVERAGE PG, CAN'T GO LEFT AND HE'S ASIAN  P.S. THE HATER'S DELUSIONAL CRYSTAL BALL VISION ARE JUST APPALLING/DISGUSTING :):):)
Dawan208::You couldn't of said it better!
Barry Bonds of Men Softball::James Harden &gt; D-Rose
mattoc113::Not even if Rose tore both ligaments in both knees.
Clutch 5000::Hmm, I wouldn't say that yet. I want to see how rose comes back from that injury.
NewAges::Some sore loser fans pretend to be lin's fans and stir up the racism and hatred
Dezagcoog::and FYI this NEVER happened with YAO. It's all the NYC media/ESPN's fault with their shameless promotion of the knicks and "linsanity"
BadBoyTX::Yes, you are absolutely correct.  If the Rockets played in NY, Mia, or LA this team would be the toast of the town right now.  You have a team that has 1 starter back from last year and they are the youngest team in the league.  If you watched ESPN today you would have thought the Laker vs Knicks and OKC vs Mia were the only two games on yesterday.  And please don't tell me it is what everyone wants to see because where I live most folks could care less about any of those teams unless they are playing their team.   Not crying just saying .
rEdBuLxTaSy::EXACTLY!!! AND IT'S A TREND THAT WON'T BE GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON.  EXPECT THEM TO RIDE LIN'S NUTS UNTIL THE DAY HE RETIRES :):):)
Dezagcoog::Some??? dude i've counted no less than like 8 between yesterday and today.
GetItFast01::I hate reading recaps and watching highlights and seeing very little of Chandler Parsons. The dude is crushing it and all I get to read about is Harden and Lin.
jchristyj::I love how that during halftime and postgame of the Rockets/Bulls did the panel on ESPN did not once mention or do any highlights of the Rockets' game at all.  Instead they kept going back to the Lakers and the Heat.  Then they talked about the Clippers.  WHERE WAS THE ANALYZING OF THE CURRENT GAME???????
BadBoyTX::I have given up on ESPN.  Totally a biased network.  I understand they are in it for the money and are playing to the masses.  When players are aloud to pick and choose where they want to play the smaller markets are totally of of luck.  If you watch ESPN everything is Northeast biased.  I do understand that they are located in Conn. but it is a national network.  They are biased in their reporting in every sport.  Baseball, football and basketball all we get to hear is the Yankees this, the Red Sox that, sickening.  Do you think it was pure luck that C. Paul was traded to the Clippers.  Not a chance says Mr Stearn, I am in charge here and I want him in LA, so no Rockets and whoever else wanted to trade with New Orleans.  Really looks like the Hornets got the best of the deals offered huh.  I guess if you relate it to politics you have the 2%  (NY, LA, MIA, Boston) and all the rest of us in the 98%.
Clutch 5000::iI disagree. He has been important but Lin getting hot is what has sparked us on this win steak. Asik has been averaging a double double. Hes easily number 2. Parsons D is great but hes no offensive force.  I understand why some would rank parsons higher. I just feel Lin is more valuable to us
Dezagcoog::woah! no offensive force? he's the second best scorer!! behind Harden. What are you talking about? and the season has been almost 30 games long, not 3. Lin has done well for 3 games not 30 like Parsons has.
Clutch 5000::Harden, asik, lin, parsons. In that order. Parsons doesn't get enough love because of what he does. A defensive 3 that can shoot a 3 when healthy. That shoulder injury has held him back
Dezagcoog::no way dude. Parsons has been just as important as Asik. it's difficult to decide which of the two is second and third. Lin has definitely been fourth. He might move up as the season goes on but in no way is he parsons fourth. Parsons has been the second best scorer, best perimeter defender, second best defender overall, and has carried us through no less than a third of our games. The guy has been massively important this season.
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND YOU HAVE TO ADMIT WHEN PARSON/HARDEN WAS SHOOTING BRICKS, THEY WEREN'T GETTING CALL OUT FOR IT LIKE LIN NEITHER:):):)
nbafanatic69::We all know TD is dead last.  If there's one thing we need to apologize for, it's unloading him to you guys...
Dezagcoog::HAHAHAHAHAHAHA agreed!! he's terrible. but in all fairness he has helped us win a couple of games. All of a sudden he started playing well like 10 games ago.
Dezagcoog::agreed. probably second best player on the team so far. It is  between him an Asik. Obviously Harden as the best.
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::Wheres the white people calling racist like all theses asians??
NewAges::If you are the Rockets fans, Lin's fans, Harden's fans....enemy of your enemy is your friend, so ignore other loser fans with racist comments..
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::My pity to you rockets fans cant believe you have to deal with this BS all the time.
Dezagcoog::Yeah it's gotten completely untenable.
Clutch 5000::Lets stopthe racism. It was a great game by asik, harden, and lin.  Nate Robinson too.
Jalfmar3::I'm going away now. Here the Rockets are balling and I have to read this racist this, racist that crap. The rest of the league would be laughing at us if they bothered to read this.
nbafanatic69::You guys are such a classless bunch.   You'd never hear this kind of crap on the Knicks boards, unless of course a Lin worshipper started it.
Clutch 5000::I blame moderating lol
Clutch 5000::Im a lin lover. I consider myself classy. Quit stereotyping people. Lets just not attack each other
rEdBuLxTaSy::STOP PRETENDING THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE CLASSY AND BEAUTIFUL.  YOU'RE AN EXAMPLE OF ANOTHER ONE SIDE BIASED TROLL TRYING TO STIR UP THE POT AGAIN
Dezagcoog::then sir you are the exception. I like Lin and am very happy he's here but 99% of Lin lovers/worshippers/fanatics are annoying and many have been racist. Bombing the boards and making it impossible to have anormal conversation.
rEdBuLxTaSy::ANOTHER TROLL WHO LOVES TWISTING THE FACTS.  BELIEVED ME WHEN I SAY MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE RACIST DIRTBAGS CAUSE THEY ARE  :):):)
Dezagcoog::exactly, it's all Lin lovers
rEdBuLxTaSy::FUNNY THING IS MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS TEND TO GET ALL BUTT HURT ONCE THE TABLE GETS TURN.    "IT'S ONLY RACISM WHEN WE'RE THE VICTIMS"  ~~ OBSESSED LIN HATERS :):):)
Dezagcoog::Can everyone please flag tiesto, no need to have all this racism on the boards
tiesto281::AWWWWW... DID I HURT YOUR FEELINGS. POOR GUY.
Dezagcoog::No, you're just a disgusting Human being.
rEdBuLxTaSy::MOST LIN FANS ARE NOT RACIST BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT THERE ARE A FEW EXTREME LIN FANS WHOM ARE THE EXCEPTION.  WITH THAT BEING SAY, MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE RACISTS AND WILL POINT OUT LIN'S RACE AS A FACTOR BEHIND THEIR ILL-CONCEIVED JUDGEMENT:):):)
Quang6864::I'm a Lin fan, and I admit some of the Lin fan starting $@%! for no reason. There are fake Lin fans here instigating , putting fuel on the fire.
rEdBuLxTaSy::SAYS ALOT WHEN ALL YOU COULD SAY IS THAT :):):)
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::Wrong
nbafanatic69::Can't wait to see what these racist Asian Lin fans are gonna do once Lin starts tanking again.  Oh you'll blame whatever black guys you can, from Harden balhogging to Melo flashbacks and maybe McHale's white man tendencies to suppress the yellow man.  You guys are a joke and need to go back to your regular interests -- like anime crap or video games.
NewAges::Coming from a sore loser Knicks fan.....Really want stir up the bs
Clutch 5000::Melo isn't going to be MVP.
rEdBuLxTaSy::GEE, ANOTHER BUTT HURT KNICKS FAN WHO CAN'T GET OVER LIN LEAVING NY.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO WAY PLEASE :):):)
tiesto281::I'm going to make any and every excuse to prove I'm not a wetbag, but I really am.  -Dezagcoog
tiesto281::HAHA!! WOW!! YOU MUST REALLY HATE YOURSELF TO BE MAKING LIES LIKE THAT. WHO IN THE HELL GOES FOR A (MEXICAN) SOCCER TEAM OUT OF THE BLUE? LMAO!!! SHUT UP JEW BOY
Dezagcoog::How do you know it's out of the blue?? You don't know what reasons I have for that.....OHHH wait I forgot you Lin fans know EVERYTHING so you know why I'm a fan of them...Get a life. I didn't know being born in the Methodist Hospital at the Texas Med Center makes you a wetba.ck...
tiesto281::i'm not making it a race thing, just need dezag to admiy it, which he still hasn't. U ASHAMED TO BE A MEXICAN? I KNOW I WOULD. LOL
rEdBuLxTaSy::I WASN'T...READ AGAIN :):):)
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::rEdBuLxTaSy - I  HAVE TO SAY WE SHOULDN'T STOOP THE THE LOW LEVEL OF OBSESSED LIN HATERS...RACISM IS RACISM IN MY BOOK :):):)  Then why u making racist comments idiot
Dezagcoog::if being a White Jew with a Polish and Arabic background to you is called Mexican, then sure I'm a Mexican LOLOLOL
tiesto281::AND YET AGAIN, DOESN'T COME FORTH AND ADMITTING HE'S A BEENER! LOL. I DON'T BLAME YA SP!CK
rEdBuLxTaSy::I  HAVE TO SAY WE SHOULDN'T STOOP THE THE LOW LEVEL OF OBSESSED LIN HATERS...RACISM IS RACISM IN MY BOOK :):):)
Dezagcoog::but you're not making it a race thing???? LOL seriously? you just can flat out lie the very next sentence with a straight face. I'd show you a picture of me but I'm afraid you'd try to send a hitman cause I said Lin isn't perfect.
rEdBuLxTaSy::HEY LET'S NOT MAKE THIS A RACE THING ALRITE.  THIS IS THE VERY SAME REASON WHY THERE ARE OBSESSED LIN HATERS IN THE FIRST PLACE :):):)
Dezagcoog::Im going to say racist things to upset people and be a troll. and insist on it over and over because I'm not getting the rise out of them that I want cause I'm a racist hate monger loser.  -tiesto281
npse6636::Watch out Rox when playing against Westbrook of Thunder.  Westbrook just poked two people's eye two games in a row, one Kevin Love of wolves &amp; C Bosh of Heat.  One caused KLove to sit out; the other was bad but bad but not that bad.  U might think it's by accident and the intensity of the game.  But two games in a row and did that while Thunder was losing, go figure.
tiesto281::i liked westbrook but he's been acting like a spoiled punk as of late. shane did a touch foul last night and he charged as if do to something. wut a punk!
nbafanatic69::Earlier suggestion of us taking back Lin?  Are you nuts?  I bet Lin's dying to come back but we'd never take him.  NYC is so over Lin and his average play that we wouldn't take him free packaged with draft picks.
Clutch 5000::Lol Knicks would love to have Lin back. You're on crack.
Avenger5454::Hell yeah! Why would Lin want to come back?! He got paid in Houston for potential and he has tons! NYK very little potential or upside with their current roster!!
rEdBuLxTaSy::COMING BACK TO WHAT?  A CESSPOOL OF LUNATICS WHOM COULDN'T GET PAST THE 1ST ROUND LOL?! :):):)
rockus_2008::How to sell Lin's jersey.  You have to create 4 types of Lin's jersey.  1.  A regular Houston Rockets Jersey with Lin's name on the back for the regular fans. 2.  A non-descript Jersey with Lin's name on the back for Lin's fans so if he's traded, the jersey is still usable. 3.  Both jerseys from 1 and 2 but with Lin's Chinese name on the back to cater for the more than 1 Billion fans. 4.  Both jerseys from 1 and 2 with Lin's name on the back but with an X on it for Lin's haters and doubters.
NewcastleFanVL::wow! kudos!
nbafanatic69::Oh watch, any critique of that nice kid but hopelessly outmatched LIN and you're labelled racist.  I don't care if he's Chinese or Taiwanese or whatever he calls himself these days. He's exposed and limited in his skill set.  Sure he can play, just not as a starter.  I still shiver at the memory of how he turtled and trembled when he played for us against the Heat back in Feb.
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND LET ME REMIND YOU AGAIN, LIN GOT ZERO HELP FROM HIS TEAMMATES BECAUSE MELO/STATS GOT ISSUES AND THEIR EGOS WERE AS BIG AS THEIR HEAD.  KEEP ON SPINNING THAT DELUSIONAL RANTS IN YOUR HEAD OVER AND OVER...AS IF THAT'LL CHANGE THE FACTS LOL :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND I GUESS YOU ARE THE GENIUS TO DETERMINED LIN'S WORTH?  LOL GTFO AND GO BACK TO IMPROVING YOUR BUM OUT LIFE :):):)
ThanksForTheRide::Hated or not (mostly not), Lin is easily the most talked about player in all Rockets games.  Linsanity pwns all you haters lol.
Dezagcoog::what all haters? the one knick fan? no one hates Lin, just annoying fanatics.
ThanksForTheRide::I'm refering to those who have spewed hate in all Rockets games this season, and last season for the Knicks too for that matter.  Every time a troll posts a hateful remark without a substance to aback it up, he's dropping a $100 bill into Jeremy's piggy bank.
rEdBuLxTaSy::I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH HATE IN SPORTS SINCE LINSANITY.  IF YOU ROOT FOR THE GUY, THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS WILL LABEL YOU A BANDWAGONER OR PYSCHOPATH.  THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE THE KING OF TROLLS :):):)

Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::Lol you bragging that your people work for pennies a day? Great life
rEdBuLxTaSy::FOOL IF YOU HATED CHI.NKS THAT MUCH, PERHAPS YOU NEED TO BURN YOUR ENTIRE HOUSE DOWN SINCE 90% OF THE CONTENTS ARE FROM CHINA...THAT'S IF YOU OWN A HOME LOL :):):)
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::I dont shop at walmart try again
rEdBuLxTaSy::HAHA YOU REALLY THINK CH.INKS ARE THE MOST HATED?  FOOL, YOU COULDN'T STOP SHOPPING AT WALMART SO WHY TRIPPING LOL?  :):):)
Dezagcoog::no, you shouldn't lower yourself to their levels.
Dezagcoog::I really hope that all you racists live in Asia. I'd hate to think you were here in the US. No I'm a white jew. My dad is of arab descent and my mom is of polish descent FYI.
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::Im sorry for my comment you shouldnt fight racism with more racism but you Lin fans are unbearable.
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::coming from a chi.nk the most hated people in the world
Dezagcoog::Wait...You think that everyone who goes to UH is hispanic? you do know that UH is the second most diverse campus in the nation right?
rEdBuLxTaSy::IT'S SAD IF THAT'S REALLY COMING FROM A BEENER...THE MOST HATED ILLEGALS OF THE USA :):):)
tiesto281::shows you root for UofH(University of Houston) and America(MEXICAN SOCCER TEAM) SO YEEES, YOU'RE STILL A BEENER!!!!!
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::LOL and Lin haters are racist s.t.f.u
Jalfmar3::I feel so bad for Lin having to have these people as his fans. Just like Tebow. These are the same type of people that drank the Kool-Aid in Jonestown. They don't want their own lives, just that of their savior, whoever they choose that to be. They are no longer "fans" in the colloquial sense, but truly fanatics.
Dezagcoog::wow perfect way to say it  "They are no longer 'fans' in the colloquial sense, but truly fanatics."
Dezagcoog::lolol yeah but its almost not worth dealing with this....
Jalfmar3::Thank you, just calling it as I see it. I always liked Lin, even before they cut him previously. I like him now quite a bit. He's a good, serviceable point guard with flashes of genius from time to time. He may prove more than that as he gains experience. I will not hold his fanatics against him. (Mostly because they tend to wiggle and it's hard to get a good grip, b'doom bam.)
Dezagcoog::Hardest time ever to be a rockets fan. In 23 years I've never had to deal with such crazy people. On one side butthurt knick fans, on the other side psycho obsessed Lin fans(most seem to be racist cause they keep bringing race into the discussion). Wish all these people would go away. Lin doesn't even seem worth it at this point.
Jalfmar3::Lin is at least trying to prove he's worth the circus. And to their credit, the Rockets are letting him. Tebow got screwed over by the Jets. Understand I am NOT a Tebow fan. I just think they abused the guy.
rEdBuLxTaSy::APPARENTLY YOU CAN'T SEEM TO COMPREHEND THE SIMPLE FACT THAT MOST OF THE DRAMA $H.IT GOING ON ARE CREATED BY OBSESSED LIN HATERS :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::SO WHAT IF A FAN WANTS THEIR IDOL TO BE SUCCESSFUL?  WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH GETTING HATED ON?  GOLD FIGURED...HATERS GONA HATE REGARDLESS :):):)
Dezagcoog::LOLOLOL cause in the past 50 posts there's been ONE Lin hater who is a knicks fan but the other 35 posts are obsessed Lin fans. yeah the haters are causing the trouble. evidence speaks for itself.
tiesto281::That doesn't matter. It's going to come with the territory. Just learn to deal with it somehow.
Dezagcoog::would rather trade him back to Knicks for pennies so they can deal with this mess. They caused it. With their stupid east coast media creating linsanity.
tiesto281::rEdBuLxTaSy &gt; J.Lin
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::rEdBuLxTaSy is the reason people dont like Lin.
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND YOU'RE THE REASON WHY LIN FANS WILL CONTINUED TO BE LIN FANS :):):)
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::Seriously I like Lin, but you guys are so ignorant it makes it hard to root for him.
Dezagcoog::and a few others. I like him, but see that these people cause hatred cause of how rude and obnoxious they are.
rEdBuLxTaSy::MOST LIN FANS EXPECT HIM TO BE AN ABOVE AVERAGE PG.  THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE THE ONES PUTTING HIM HIGH ON A PEDESTAL, ONLY TO WISH HE FAILS JUST TO MAKE A POINT AND THEN BLAME THE LIN FANS FOR IT.     P.S.  JUST GOTTA LOVE DELUSIONAL OBSESSED LIN HATERS :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::A REMINDER TO THE DELUSIONAL HATERS ARE MUCH WARRANTED :):):)
Dezagcoog::yeah, trolls feed off this huh. I do hate lin fans. Love lin though.
Dezagcoog::You've said that a thousand times....go away already.
rEdBuLxTaSy::IF BEING A FAN OF AN ATHLETE IS CONSIDER "PSYCHOPATHS", THEN PERHAPS YOU NEED TO GET OFF ESPN YOURSELF AND STOP BLOWING AIR OUT OF BOTH HOLES HYPOCRITE! :):):)
Dezagcoog::lol why? cause you're idiotic obnoxious psychopaths lol thats why.
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND WHY SHOULD YOU BE HATING ON LIN FANS?  THEY ARE FANS AFTER ALL AREN'T THEY?  PERHAPS YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO YOURSELF AND GO JUMP OFF A CLIFF IF LIFE IS AS BAD AS YOU PAINT IT OUT TO BE :):):)
Dezagcoog::haven't ranted about lin. Ranted about you dumb lin fans. But somehow the difference doesn't seem to get through to you. You're sooo obsessed with Lin you think you are him. You're like one of those crazy stalkers who ends up killing who they stalk.
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND YOUR MEDIOCRE RANTINGS OF LIN ARE GETTING OLD AS WELL.  PERHAPS YOU NEED TO GO WAY YOURSELF
nbafanatic69::About time a Rockets fan called out Lin for what he is-- a turnover machine who needs considerable improvement so he can be trusted with the ball.  I like the kid, he tries, but he needs a lot of work and more experience.  I shudder to think what our record would have been had he stayed with us and not chased the big payday in Houston.  Linsanity was a overblown event showcasing an average player who could reliably give up TOs as high as 8 per game.  Knicks fans are thrilled he's no longer our problem.
nbafanatic69::I don't know what's more laughable; a rockets freak lecturing me about my team with this year's MVP melo and most experienced PG tandem in Felton/Kidd, or the very idea that an average EXPOSED player like Lin will get better over time.  A kid who would rather TO the ball or make his own shot than pass the ball around.  Smh.
BadBoyTX::Yes it was terrible to watch the Knicks get their $@% handed to them by the Rockets on two occasions this year.  MVP.  Please that usually comes from a team that does something.   I guess you are just lucky that the Rockets aren't in the East.  Rockets are 11-2 against the mighty East.
H-Town Dream Shake::I guess you didn't see the way Felton played on Christmas. He was terrible and a TO machine. Knicks are done since they can't make those wide open 3s anymore.
tiesto281::if by experienced tandem you mean old then sure. that age and wear and tear on those old farts on your team WILL catch up....
Dezagcoog::LOL sorry mr. Butthurt knicks fan. Lin has stopped bieng a turnover machine. The guy is becoming much more efficient and BURNED the knicks. Get over it. He's growing and getting better and will continue to. I shudder to think what your record would be too. Y'all would be almost perfect and no one likes the knicks so who would want them to have a perfect season.
rEdBuLxTaSy::ANOTHER OBSESSED LIN HATER WHO WILL CONTINUED TO HATE THE KID FOR AS LONG AS HE IS IN THE NBA.  KEEP ON HATING...AS IF THAT WILL DO YOU ANY GOOD HAHA :):):)
Dezagcoog::Dude don't you have anything better to do with your life?
tiesto281::lol. Really? go crawl back in your hole Lin-Hater. I'm not making him out to be John Stockton but the guy has amazing speed and his shot has gotten better. For you to sit there and make him out to be a high school b-ball player shows your ignorance.
tiesto281::Rockets should go for either Aldridge or J-Smooth....
JPPenjoysBullying::..In FA
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::I dont think people hate Lin as much as they hate his fans. Boy you guys are obnoxious.
rEdBuLxTaSy::BUT WE UNDERSTAND ALL THE HATE BECAUSE LIN IS THE MOST HYPE AND BELOVED ATHLETE AT THE MOMENT :):):)
Dezagcoog::lol beloved!!!!!!! The worst of the worst is back!
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND LIN FANS ARE THE WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE RACIST PIGS SO IT'S ABOUT EVEN IN MY BOOK :):):)
Dezagcoog::exactly. Plus you are the racist ones. I've barely seen anyone say anything about lin being asian, but i've read sooooo many lin fans hating on black people...kinda sad and scary to be honest.
Swag Police Miley Cyrus Itty Bitty Workout Outfits::No actually you guys are just toxic and hate all the other players on the team that arent Lin.
Dezagcoog::THANK YOU! I don't think anyone really hates Lin, but you say a single thing about him that isn't him being a demi-g-d and they jump all over you and claim it's everyone's fault but his. The guy is pretty good, can probably develop into being pretty great, but he isn't now. I was really excited when he got here but I didn't realize how much baggage came with him...
dhomerding::Boozer and 2nd Round pick for P. Gasol!
Dezagcoog::LOL no one wants boozer. He was only ever effective when he was playing under Sloan in Utah and was allowed to flagrant foul everyone without getting a single call against him.
