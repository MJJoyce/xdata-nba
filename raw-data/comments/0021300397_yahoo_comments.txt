Amir::Worst NBA offensive roster ( its worst 100% without Rose, Deng and Butler) is on good pace to score 120+ against worst coached team in NBA. Cavs coach should come in Europe in Belgium or Portuguese league that is right place for him.
Larry::Wow another Mike Brown special!
another1::Cleveland doing a better job of tanking than the Bulls.
Amir::Bynum defensive mobility in paint protecting and helping  is something unrecorded in pro basketball history.
Teams stink::I thought cleveland would EASILY beat the bucks and barely pulled out the win.  I thought they would run over the bulls, too, but after that last game, I found that this team really sucks so who knows who will win this one.  Go bulls!
Haven::And the Bulls ONCE AGAIN get to play a tired opponent on their back2back. The Bulls get more back2back opponents than any other team in the league, hell they get more opponents on a back2back than not.  Conspiracy
- LJ::cleaveland has no chance in this game w/out thier super rookie bennett
Naturally Tanned Man::Augustin and Nate robinson continue to prove one thing....they are 10 times better than that scrub kirk hinrich
me::I remember watching Augustin play a few years ago and he was pretty impressive.  How did he become so ? He has talent.....
Allen::needed a victory
