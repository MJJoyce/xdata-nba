CollisionofSouls::The Sixers are struggling to score.  This is not news. But Brand stepped up and took charge.  The last 45 days of Sixers losses can best be described as 'who has the ball(s) to step up and score?"  Thought it might be Turner, but he fizzled.  Dre is inconsistent and Williams is good for 16.  Brand looked like he was 23 and not 33.  Dude, you're 6-9 so just take it to 'em.  The mid-range jumper is good but just take it to 'em, buddy.  Oh and by the way, you're getting a huge check every night so we need some points and rebounds for the huge paycheck.  That was what he did last night.    I'm changing my earlier statement about the Knicks winning the Atlantic.  Their schedule is too tough and I'm not sure they'll even make the playoffs now.  The Sixers will win by a game. They won't get past the first round.
. Zone6_ATLien .::The 76ers dont scare me any more than any of the other playoff teams we actually have wins against. I didnt see game 2, but I saw this one and the 1st meeting. They were close ball games, until Philly started raining  and making damn near every clutch 3 point shot to spread it out on 2 or 3 consecutive possessions. Stuff like that could go either way, just happened to drop for the Sixers in those 2 games. I'd rather face this team that beat us tonight than the Knicks that we beat last night.

ima brave falcon hawk::and here comes the trolls
ima brave falcon hawk::good game 76ers fans
eric110377::I don't know the business side of things, but is there anyway the Hawks can trade Joe Johnson?  They need to get rid of him while he still has some perceived value.
Martin6422::Don't about Atlanta they will be ok
Calinative760::Evan Turner got paid a couple million to miss that free throw..
MileHighFan9::Well thats game

crimson-knights123::76ers sewpt them this year. how were the hawks suppose to win?
Martin6422::We will have a full roster come playoffs, don't worry
ima brave falcon hawk::well losing to a over 500 team is new than ok
Bostonfan1010222::Celtics are still taking this divsion so no need for 76ers to try so hard! They would be 7th. J-Lin out and Milwakee is inconsistent, no other team will take there spot so happy facing the Heat!
WarsawFactory::Someone obviously hasn't seen April's schedule for the two teams.
Martin6422::Really?
