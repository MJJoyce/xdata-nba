jeff050578::3-0 on current road trip. Go Dubs.
motogpboy46::This could have easily been a "trap" game for the Warriors. Playing their third game in four nights, and on a back to back, against a 2 win team... they could have easily succumbed to fatigue and took an L that would look a lot worse in print than it would have been in reality. To win 3 straight games in 4 days on the road in the NBA isn't an easy task even for championship caliber teams; Warriors are showing they can look good even without a legitimate center in their 12.
aj8707::won 6 out of last 7, and i attended that one loss SMH
Oaktown1029::lol
michol0808::I like Landry, Jarrett off season signings!!
michol0808::All of a sudden, W's have lot of good young players...   what happened?
rhoppe28::Give props to the Bob Myers and the rest of the front office. They're building a winner. Finally we have a competent GM running the show. Warriors fans are arguably the most loyal fan base in all of sports. We deserve a winning basketball team to cheer for. I think there's something special brewing here in the Bay Area. Wait til we get Bogut back. This team is gonna be scary! #GSW-HOOPS
michol0808::IS this for real??   WOW....  3rd straight road win...
oOARaiderOo::GSW = Legit.

YaImFromCleveland::you can't out-tank us DC, we'll show you
OAKLANDFUNK::\X/EST COAST!!
troy_green1::Nice win for the Dubs! Washington hung tough but poor shooting from the line, bad shot selection, and lack of rebounding did them in. Golden State did try to hand the game to Washington with a plethora of turnovers and basically general shaky play. D Lee held tough with Curry, Thompson, and Landry doing just enough to squeak out a win. Watching this game I thought early on that the Dubs should runaway with this one. So far this season the Dubs play to the level of their opponents, which is a good and bad thing. There was too much swag out of G State early on. The shot selection of the Warriors early on was one of a cocky team. The Warriors just need to stay level headed, play their game, and treat every opponent as if they were best in the league. Outside of the negatives it was good to get that win!   Good Game G State! 13-7 after 20 is a nice place to be.
rhoppe28::It was an ugly game. It was the 3rd game in 4 nights, 2nd game of a back to back, and after that emotional win in Brooklyn, this game had all the making of a trap game. The Warriors did just enough to win. This team is showing a lot of resiliency. They could have easily packed it in. I don't think they'll play like this against the teams they're supposed to beat for the remainder of the season. I just think it was what it was. An ugly game. These cats were tired.
maleckej::it was the second game of a back to back.
Jfs70ss::CAAAN YOU DIG IIIT..............!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jfs70ss::WARRIORS..........COME OUT AND PLAAAAY YAAAY !!!!!!..................................
SSparkySteelerssaysJetsStink::Boy was I wrong regarding the Warriors this year! Who needs that big fat center who can't stay healthy, he isn't needed!
rhoppe28::We still need Bogut. A healthy Bogut, playing 25-30 minutes a game will take this team to the next level.
Faizal1587::WCW!!!
blackholeson0813::work a lot of nights so i dont get to watch very often only seen two games this year so honestly how do the warriors look so far and barring injuries where do you think they will end up at the end of the season ?
Raiders Godfather333::They are playing defense and it is really helping right now. They will be even better when Bogut returns. It is still to early to tell but they could get a 5-8 seed.
Jgarcia5603::Warriors making me want to end my NBA boycott. The play of the Lakers also. Haha
Viktor Karelin::Will the warriors make the playoffs?
WarriorsWarrior::Clippers have had at least four more home games then the Warriors .05 game BACK! don't worry!
Jfs70ss::Clippers win to stay a half game up...............
Jfs70ss::D LEE IS A BAAAAD MAAAN...............!!!!!
Jfs70ss::D LEE BABY!!!!!
WarriorsWarrior::24pts 17rbs  Guess who?
BayArya::King David
WarriorsWarrior::Bingo!
Jfs70ss::Watching  Steph postgame interview.  No mention of ankle so I guess he's fine............
BayArya::Thank god Steph is fine
Jfs70ss::FO  SHOW!
Jfs70ss::WARRIORS..........COME OUT AND PLAAAAY YAAAY   !!!!!!..................................
WarriorsWarrior::I won't complain we won!  gg washington!
Cbowzer::If/when Bogut comes back healthy this dub team could be scary.
RaidersandBama::If I'm dreaming don't wake me.
supe540::I'm thinking 3 - 1 or 2 - 2 on the rest of this roadie.
rhoppe28::I think they'll go 2-2 the rest of the way but I would be happy with 1-3. Don't be suprised if they win in Miami, tho. If they do that, I think they'll go 3-1.
Raiders Godfather333::I am a realist! If they go 1-3 I will be happy.
BayAreaSportsFan16::warriors off to best start since '91!
WFan5::Bench outplayed starters tonight
rhoppe28::The bench was fresher than the starters too.
BayAreaSportsFan16::im sure longtime warriors fans thot reality hit wen curry went down momentarily and we were gonna lose the game
gsraider::Pinche warriors estan ganando
bradyandjrich::Wiz show some fight and promise...just need Wall back.
satar1::If either David Lee or Steph Curry doesnt make the all star team this year NBA doesnt know what talent is then !!! #  Curry and Lee
Oaktown1029::Lee had 17 rebounds, Landry had 9, and Green had 8 - 2 power forwards and a small forward. Ezeli only had 1 rebound and Beidrins, well, never mind about Beidrins.
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::ezeli plays good d
Oaktown1029::yeah he does.
supe540::Thank goodness the Warriors pounded the boards.  Only way they won.
gsraider::Bucher &gt; Steinmetz
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::steinmetz needs to be gone
epamobsta650::I liked Steinmetz because he said what was on his mind without fear
WarriorsWarrior::Not really.
SB4LlFE::also.. during that last FT by beal, he crossed the FT line before the ball hit the rim.. lane violation!!!
d butler16::When is Ted Leonsis gonna clean house at the end of the season fire everybody now. This team is something that comes out of your a.ss
epamobsta650::Stop betting if you don't like to lose
WestCoastSuperiority::better even, stop blaming others because you're losing.
supe540::GG Wiz fans.  See you back in the Bay.
bjb7224::37 points in 5 minutes
MoonMan2425::Golden State is gonna win it all
cballou18::^said no one ever
bjb7224::the under was on all the way until 5 minutes to go
SB4LlFE::couldn't play any better for the win... survived the turnovers, the refs, and the hot shooting wizards toward the end
bjb7224::what bullsh!t
WestCoastSuperiority::Is there anything more satisfying than hearing dozens of gamblers cry at the same time?  Way to go Warriors. 13-7!
TOOLFAN2006::You guys all talk fix all you want.  The Wizards team absolutely stinks.  The Warriors are good.  SCOREBOARD
champion7876::FIX is on
