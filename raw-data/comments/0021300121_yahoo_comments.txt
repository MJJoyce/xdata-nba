joseph::I have an idea.  Let's go out and give 2 people passed their primes 40 million and see what happens.
poyman::Great players seldom make great coaches... Take Jason Kidd for example...
RoMee::Up next for the Nets is Phoenix a team with ZERO superstar and it looks like it'll be an easy win for Phoenix.
Jaime M::When I think of how much the Nyets owner has paid for his roster, and can't help  but to burst out laughing. I can't think of anyone with a more bloated sense of self grandeur than a filthy rich Russian.  He just thought he'd come in and buy a title.  Welcome to NBA ownership, tovarisch.
bodhibo::Boo Nets! Let 'em loss and let the owner learn that his profligate ways don't make a team great!
thinking out loud::I honestly didn't think the Nets was this bad. I knew they weren't contenders but I didn't think they was going to be this bad. The nets might be a bigger disappointment than the Bulls this year. KG and Pierce are playing for the Nets but their hearts are still in Boston.  Deron Williams is not a PG that makes everyone around him better, lIke CP3 or even Rubio. Joe Johnson will only play one good game every two weeks.. maybe.
Jay M.::How about those championship Nets?
WSU Grad::Cousins and his nephews finally won a game.
thinking out loud::I don't understand why the Nets thought Pierce and Garnett would bring them a championship? They're old and way past their prime.
Pika_Stache::Random question...Are Miles and Mason Plumlee brothers?
