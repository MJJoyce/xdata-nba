T.c. Brown::I just love how every Bobcats game preview that comes out starts with "so and so is on a losing streak but a game against the Bobcats should help that." Get over yourselves ESPN. It's crap how you expect a team to LOSE day after day, even to the likes of Milwaukee. Pathetic. These aren't the same Bobcats.Time to come up with some new material.
