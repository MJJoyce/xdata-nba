David::Oh come now let those poor New York fans have their say. After all when one considers that  BOTH New York based teams COMBINED have not won as many games as the Pacers this year, it is obvious that they can't play basketball so trash talking is all they have left.
tony m::GO PACERS   I'm headed out now to make the game with my son.  Got balcony seats. Hopefully some folks wont show on the lower levels due to the weather and I can move down
Paul G::Not going to win many games shooting 30-81. Ross, Johnson, Valancuinas and Vasquez a combined 3 for 26.  The rest of the team 27 for 55. Why were these guys shooting? After a while you have to say it is not my night and dish the ball. Looking at the assists, they were not doing that either. Coach needs to get in there a little more I think.
Mister E::And trade Lowry and Derozan.
Mister E::GET THE BALL TO JONAS!! And fire Dwayne Casey.
Miami Best::Indiana scrubs will lose again to torronto scrubs lmao
it is what it is::Funy how one Knicks fan keeps showing up here with the same pathetic sentence over and over:  "hillbillies and scrubs".  It is REALLY pathetic they feel the need to keep typing the same thing over and over and can't say anythiing on their own team's pages.  Oh yeah they are a Knicks fan.  They have the sideshow team of Melo and Smith to "support".  What an embarrassment to the league.  And by the way Knickschump:  those guys you are calling hillbillies are NOT from Indiana.  It is evident your intelligence is REALLY from the shallow end of the gene pool with comments like that.  LMFAO
mark::Toronto Crack Mayor will pull out his remaining hair on his head after this disappointing loss. And then he will do some crack to ease his pain. Thanks for nothing Raptors,you turned your Crack Mayor back into a Crackhead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HORSESHOE::Let's go Lance - let's do another triple double!  GO PACERS!
Joe S::Go Indiana!  Pacers win again!
