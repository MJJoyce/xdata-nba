mjsanders::With each Robin-like performance, it still amazes me how people can seriously say that LBJ is far &amp; away the MVP this yr!  To put it as simply as possible, LBJ is NOT main reason that MIA wins or loses gms.  When they've won close gms, it's been Wade who's been the go-to in Q4 each time.  They've lost gms b/c they missed Bosh's inside presence.  They've won plenty of gms when LBJ was the 2nd or even 3rd best player on the team -- like last night!  This is not MVP stuff!  By comparison, OKC only goes as Durant goes.  When they win close gms, he makes the crucial plays down the stretch 90% of the time.  He always takes the last shot -- make or miss, win or lose!  Westbrook &amp; Harden are very good players, but they're clearly sidekicks.  Durant is the man on that team from start to finish of every single gm.  KD for MVP!!!
054sandra::The people who confess to be fans of NBA and focus merely on what LeBron James does for every moment that he's visible on the court. I have but one thing to say for you: GET SOME HELP! This thing - that ails you - isnot going to go away all by itself. There is no other athlete that you can justifiably say deserves all of the hate that is spewed on him - just because he left ANOTHER team other than your own. (That last part is a fact; as rarely do you hear from Cleveland Cav. fans that do not live in Cleveland) LeBron leads - as in; in front of, the first - his team in almost every category except blocks. In addition, under the magnified scrutiny I'd say he is the leader for another MVP! (see Jeremy LIn for pressure of scrutiny)
LilFitz_datboi::LeBron is a boss....the man only got 14 points and still was a stat stuffer with 12 rebounds, 7 assists, 5 steals. Clutch Defense and Clutch Dimes are King  traits that Wade, KD, Kobe and Melo have forgotten about.
kidmandavid::yeah d wade is hecka dope.. and so are the other guys u mentioned
Hey where did Tebow go::where's that heat fan chick with the huge b00bs?
Los P.E.P.E.S::Oh yeah and the Dolphins are a damn disgrace!! Ireland needs to go and Ross needs to sell the team to real owner that doesn't have shares for sale of team to be celebrity owners!! They making this organization seem like a joke and I say this as a lifetime Phin fan!! Marino coming out of retirement will be the only move to stop this mess for the qb position down here smh.. It's a f ing joke!!
Los P.E.P.E.S::lmfao these lame as.s haters getting cornier by the second... haters gonna hate lol...
Lebrons 4HEAD::^talk about my 4th qrtr chokes and you can fry a dozen eggs on me ^
Los P.E.P.E.S::great time at the game yesterday but even better was seeing Miami take care of business on them boards yesterday!! Wade went off in the 4th, Bosh played great, and though Bron struggled offensively he led charge in grabbing those boards!! Big shots by Battier, Rio, and UD when needed and overall good defense throughout game! Only negative was the bad officiating and I never complaint about refs.. Being there 20 rows from the floor made it clear the refs called bs calls on Miami.. Regardless good win, lets go Heat!!
JB_Smoove_Listens_With_Dre_Beats_Only::Gloria James: "Operator. Its lebron, I cant find him!"  Operator: "where di you see him last?"  Gloria: "He said he was going to get some food. He loves chiken but I didnt see him at popeyes, KFC, or Church's.  Operator: "Did you try BFC?" BONELESS Fried Chicken?"  Gloria: "I found him!!!"
shaqatastic::Idiot
RunTheBall22::What do you call the three superstars who decided to play together for the Miami Heat next season? The Three Mi-Egos
RunTheBall22::What is Webster's new definition of pointless? LeBron James in the 4th quarter!
RunTheBall22::Why did BP contact Lebron James about containing the Gulf Oil Spill? Because they wanted him to clog the pipes with his EGO!
RunTheBall22::What did Matisyahu say to Lebron James? Your not the only king without a crown
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::?
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Dem_Canes_Man has a cold sore from all that Lebron slurpin that he's been doing.
Dem_Canes_Man::?
Dem_Canes_Man::Yes..The Dolphins need to hire Pat Riley to run the franchise, and let the legend Chuck Norris be the GM.
Los P.E.P.E.S::or Marino to find the fountain of youth to fix this qb mess down here.. smdh..
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::?
Dem_Canes_Man::diagnosis update:  Lebron-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Still fuc.king stupid.
Dem_Canes_Man::?
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Would you expect a Canes fan to have a rational argument? I guess not.
Dem_Canes_Man::?
Dem_Canes_Man::?
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::I'm not sure that would be considered a stress disorder. Actually I'm positive it wouldn't be.
Dem_Canes_Man::excellent Brandon! Medical student I see. :)
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Nice.
brandonlee561heat22::The disorder would be you using is his name 1 out of every 3 times you post, like a lot of the people that post here, do.
Dem_Canes_Man::?
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::For this to be intelligent Lebron would have had to do something to me, causing me stress, resulting in a disorder.
Dem_Canes_Man::?
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::How is this intelligent whatsoever?
Dem_Canes_Man::?
nba is the worst::Is that why his stats shrink so much in the Finals?
Dem_Canes_Man::lol....good comeback.  No, it's a description of the fan base who become irrational and filled with wrath upon hearing the name Lebron.
_misterfurious::Manning really chose to play with a team that has a mediocre offensive line and maybe the worst collective group of receivers in the NFL?  Good luck.
flyingiron2463::he hasn't made a decision yet.
nba is the worst::Guess he figured with their defense he could easily make denver a SB candidate
_misterfurious::I mean maybe - their defense is good - by the 49ers wanted him and their defense is much better.
RunTheBall22::not everyone is like Lebron and needs other superstars to carry him
Dem_Canes_Man::Lebron-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder
_misterfurious::What the hell does Lebron have to do with Peyton Manning? You should see a shrink for your obsession.
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Kobe is the only player in the NBA that doesn't have to drive to the rack to get fouled.
nba is the worst::Apparently you haven't been watching the patented heatles "neck jerk arm flail" in the backcourt
brandonlee561heat22::Tebow will now be coming to the Phins sometime in the near future.
Los P.E.P.E.S::man I hope not... Anyone but Tebow.. don't hate the guy, just as a qb...
Dem_Canes_Man::yeah....I think so.
Dem_Canes_Man::I don't think that they would like it....Marino set the bar quite high, and the fan base have been searching ever since.
brandonlee561heat22::I like the Bucs, but I think it would be good for the city. Not really sure how people feel about him in Miami
Airtight Granny::I hope as a fullback.
nba is the worst::The dirty play continues - every game vs the heatles someone on the opposing team is bleeding from the mouth.  Heatles are dirty floppers
Airtight Granny::The Lakers bleed from the vagina every single game.
flyingiron2463::oh well it gets us wins.
Dem_Canes_Man::Houston, did an excruciating number on Wade last year.
nba is the worst::(Insert mom "joke" here) - or did you mean Whitney Houston?  ;)
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Your mom is a dirty flopper.
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Right, your
brandonlee561heat22::Your*
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Baseball is a p.ussy sport.
flyingiron2463::getting hit upside the head with a 91 mph fastball isn't so pu$$ in my book.
RunTheBall22::Don't know but it's a lot
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::How many people get beaned a year in the MLB?
_misterfurious::Anything is harcore compared to baseball.
Aicyla22::curling?
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::The only touching that goes on in baseball is when they slap each other's $@%!$.
RunTheBall22::lol, sounds like you just can't hang and you have glass bones. but that does not make basketball a tough guy sport.
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Yes I have been hit with a baseball. I've also had my nose broken in basketball, as well as a broken arm, not to mention a torn ACL.  You barely have to be athletic to play baseball.
RunTheBall22::ever get hit with a baseball? one home plate collision is more hardcore than the hardest NBA foul in the history of the game. there is no flopping in baseball.
RunTheBall22::and the NBA is hardcore with all those touch fouls. lol
flyingiron2463::Dwade was clutch because he had the same shoes Mike had on against the jazz on his "Last Shot".
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::The Heat are nasty
RunTheBall22::Tony Campana snapped a 0-16 start to the cactus league when he singled  to left in his first at bat sunday so you can all calm down and stop worrying so much about it
kostas444::heat is a different team with lebron on court and lebron on bench.  it has nothing to do if he scores, or whatever, he does so many things on court and it s pretty obvious that when he doesn't play heat are just  a simple team
Dem_Canes_Man::he impacts the game like crazy!
nba is the worst::Sure was in last year's Finals, right?  :/
_misterfurious::It's a little different depending on Wade and Bosh than Mo Williams and Jamison. Just saying.
Dem_Canes_Man::Wade and Bosh are there to help...not Mo Williams (that right, Mo Williams who is becoming a little black hole in LA). Talking about he was mad because of the trade for CP3; the nerve of that guy.
nba is the worst::Leads them in scoring, rebs, ast, and steals.  Cavs fans can attest to the problems that causes in pressure moments when he freezes, and the team has to compensate...
Dem_Canes_Man::lol....touche' run the ball 22.
RunTheBall22::heat are better with Lebron, wow that's really deep
Dem_Canes_Man::I got the diagnosis for the people who are obsessed with Lebron:  Lebron-traumatic-disorder.
chadhenne07::lol
Dem_Canes_Man::ok...thanks Brandon, I have never seen him before. Now, I know how to deal with that guy! Just post rational things about basketball.
brandonlee561heat22::"ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4" suffers from Lebron-traumatic-disorder.
Dem_Canes_Man::state you business sir.
Dem_Canes_Man::?
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::that was fuc.king stupid.
Dem_Canes_Man::lol...I am going to trademark that...hopefully the government don't tax me too much! :)
RunTheBall22::Manning is the anti Lebron. He knows he is good enough to turn around a team and win a ring. Doesn't need to run and join 15 other super stars, he has confidence in his skills.
chadhenne07::nothing is wrong with bron going to miami...he just wanted to play with wade really..........if bron wanted the best team to get a ring he would have went to chicago, rose, lebron, deng, noah, boozer.....please...watch out 72 - 10 bul
Dem_Canes_Man::Lebron-traumatic-disorder.
Aicyla22::really?
chadhenne07::if manning was lebron, manning would have went to san fran
RunTheBall22::whats the point, no ring is no ring. is he doin him a favor by letting him get to the super bowl only to beat him?
Dem_Canes_Man::from getting there...you read my post, right?
RunTheBall22::because Eli has two and he only has one, and if he want another one he will be blocking Eli either way.
Dem_Canes_Man::of course...why would he want to block Eli from getting to the chip?
chadhenne07::probably
Dem_Canes_Man::if  the 49ers were in the AFC, he would be there.
kaharevic::Bosh is the most important player in the heat, if he gets 20+ points and 10+ rebounds, miami is almost unstopable
Airtight Granny::LeBron is the most important player on the Heat.  Without him they really would not be going anywhere.
nba is the worst::Of course you would say that, given you think he's the most important player in the league
chadhenne07::i totally agree.....i thought bosh was the only consistant player on the heat during the finals last year.....it hurt him the most when they lost...cuz he was balling in every game in the finals
jkool216::well hes also the most emotional one.. so that might be why it hurt him the most..
Dem_Canes_Man::lol...see Wade sir; Chalmers played well too.
chadhenne07::i cant believe the dolphins didnt get manning or matt flynn....what da hell is our GM doing, if he cant convence anyone to come here why is he our GM???/
chadhenne07::i like garrrard....i have been folllowing garrard since he played at ECU in college...ima ECU fan in football...garrard is solid...ill take him i a sec...but not over manning though
jkool216::ireland is horrible.. he neeeeds to get fired
Dem_Canes_Man::two words: Jeff Ireland!
Dane Kitazaki::u guys have the inside track to garrard
JB_Smoove_AKA_MrChocolate::Boston didnt win S H I T last year and neither did Miami.
RunTheBall22::neither did the Bucks
Dem_Canes_Man::Spammer!
Dane Kitazaki::HAHA there goes tebow
SniperFighter179::Breaking News  Manning to Denver, if anyone cares
The--I--Need-A-Life-Hotline::If I want to cheer for the team ESPN hyped up, I'll chose Miami Heat, or the Philadelphia Eagles.  If I want to cheer for a team that has their ish together and is gonna make a finals run, Im choosing the Bulls.   Choose your bandwagon carefully heat fans.
ANDBOOMGOESTHEDYNAMITE4::Bulls? please.
Dem_Canes_Man::Dane Kitazaki rose wouldnt get 24 points on 12 shots  ========================================  be real Bulls fans, true or untrue?
sespi001::thats what lucas did
chadhenne07::that would make him 12/12......does any shoot that good???...be real heat fans???.....
RunTheBall22::Manning to DENVER!!!!! WTF
chadhenne07::did he really go to denver
RunTheBall22::it's not final but ESPN is talking like it is
Dem_Canes_Man::NO!
SniperFighter179::LE-BUM
SniperFighter179::LE-QUIT-NESS
Dem_Canes_Man::nba is the worst Speculation is always "simple" (minded)  ===========================================  excellent rational post sir!!!
nba is the worst::One of the most amusing things about heatles fanboys is the frequent use of "if"...  Like "If Rose had played, "If they'd reviewed the play at the end, etc...
Dane Kitazaki::I never heard a guy quote 2 losing coaches on how to beat miami and expect people not to laugh
JB_Smoove_AKA_MrChocolate::2 losing coaches? One has a ring. try again.
Dane Kitazaki::one series is enough to say that their strategies that were so highly edified doesnt work.
JB_Smoove_AKA_MrChocolate::lol in one series. feel proud? haha still didnt win s h i t
Dane Kitazaki::um 2 coaches that lost to the heat.  hows that?
Dem_Canes_Man::lol....funny bro!!  Real funny! good job!
brandonlee561heat22::Maybe they were trying to get people riled up
Dane Kitazaki::cracked me up
Dem_Canes_Man::If Rose shoots 35% from the field again, The Bulls are truly screwed.
SniperFighter179::not 1 not 2 not 3 not 4 not 5 not 6 not 7
Dane Kitazaki::Rose plays last game, Heat wins.  simple
JB_Smoove_AKA_MrChocolate::Nice logic.
nba is the worst::Speculation is always "simple"  (minded)
Dem_Canes_Man::yes...that's not his game!
Dane Kitazaki::rose wouldnt get 24 points on 12 shots
Dem_Canes_Man::yes!
RunTheBall22::lebron doesn't play in the finals heat get a ring. simple
Dem_Canes_Man::lol...good.
JB_Smoove_AKA_MrChocolate::Who knew Heat fans coul be so ignant.
Dem_Canes_Man::Spammer!
Dem_Canes_Man::spammer!
JB_Smoove_AKA_MrChocolate::lol didnt know my posts were considered spam now.
Aicyla22::haha says the celtic flip flopper fan
JB_Smoove_AKA_MrChocolate::exactly, thats not me. I'm on here reppin Boston Celtics after EVERY heat game.
Aicyla22::you're on someone else's bandwagon every day
JB_Smoove_AKA_MrChocolate::learn the meaning of a "flip flopper fan", then try again.
SniperFighter179::I schooled Lebron James  -John Lucas
_misterfurious::? Lebron guarded Lucas like three possessions the whole game. Seriously stop being ridiculous.
jkool216::and he only made that one shot on lebron that they show in replays.. he was like 1-3 against lebron
brandonlee561heat22::<b>"JLIII = Poster boy!"</b>
brandonlee561heat22::hhahaha, I quoted that for you.
nba is the worst::;)
Dane Kitazaki::threw up prayers is more like it
Dane Kitazaki::every minute
SniperFighter179::obvioulsy you didnt watch the game
chadhenne07::and the lord answered
Aicyla22::http://www.bballone.com/johnl/2012/february/feb16/johnlucas_lebrondunk.html
RunTheBall22::thats actually is my favorite dunk of the year. how often do you see someone jump over another person in a game. crazy
_misterfurious::The only thing that matters is which team is playing their best basketball going into the playoffs.   Regular season matchups? Irrelevant.  Regular season record? Irrelevant.  Home court? Irrelevant.   Only relevant things are health and momentum. That's it.
nba is the worst::Err - multiple games with double-digit ft margins in 7-gm series...
nba is the worst::BS - do you believe in the tooth fairy and the easter bunny as well?
_misterfurious::FT attempts are determined by style of play, not home court.
brandonlee561heat22::I think some team's benefit from home court advantage a lot more than others.
_misterfurious::I think it does matter for younger teams - but for veteran teams not so much.
SniperFighter179::Heat lost to the Rose-Less Bulls.  LOL
_misterfurious::lol I'm just stating facts. Sorry if the truth hurts.
_misterfurious::I guess it's not relevant because it was so long ago....
SniperFighter179::the facts of 2011
SniperFighter179::Hey its OK.... if I was a Heat fan Id be mad too.
Dane Kitazaki::rose plays, heat wins
_misterfurious::And beat the Bulls with Rose four straight times. Maybe Chicago should bench Rose for the playoffs.
JB_Smoove_AKA_MrChocolate::Figures a Heat fan would bring up last year's success lol.
Dane Kitazaki::Bulls fans, Roses injury helped the Bulls out last game.  This isnt math and u just add rose to the total.  If rose plays, lucas doesnt.  Lucas shot the ball incredibly, and rose cant shoot like that.  Fluke game.
sespi001::the nets beat the bulls... so are the nets better... shish happens and all the heat care about is the playoffs... motivation is low right now
nba is the worst::Heatles didn't win a playoff series without at least 2 games with double-digit ft margins.
jkool216::they are trying to win every game, no team tries to lose.. except for Spurs some times.... but more than anything trying to stay healthy it really doesnt matter til the playoffs... that was proven last year when the heat lost over and over to the bulls and celtics yet knocked them out easily
nba is the worst::How?  Ref help!
Dane Kitazaki::They proved they dont need it last season
chadhenne07::if u think the heat arent trying to win the east your crazy...they want home court
brandonlee561heat22::Agree, I would just be worried about such a young "kid" getting injured so much.
Dane Kitazaki::yeah, his legs are his one and only advantage.  with back and now groin problems it makes u wonder.  But he is exiting to watch ill give him that.
