Cyril::If you look at the statistics for James Harden, Klay Thompson, Monta Ellis, Eric Gordon, and Kevin Martin, and then compare them to Gordon Hayward, Hayward comes out first in rebounds, second in assists, and fourth in scoring.  That's the list of the top shooting guards in the Western Conference.  And if you compare him to Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Andre Iguodala, Nic Batum, and Chandler Parsons, he ranks second in scoring and fourth in assists among the elite small forwards in the West.  All in all, you could make a very strong argument for Hayward as a reserve in the All-Star  game if he keeps up this level of play.  The only thing working against him would be the Jazz's record.
Anton::Anthony Davis can pad all the stats he wants but Pelicans are still trash.
Chez::i personally think that New Orleans will reach the playoffs this year and will prove to be a team that will contend for a title in less than 3 years. mark my words.....Anthony Davis will be the next big star when he matures a little bit more and when the front office signs someone to compliment him better than Greg Stiemsma or Jason Smith. Jrue and Tyreke will learn how to play with each other and this team will be pretty tough to defend in a year or so. once again, MARK MY WORDS.
schmoe::You trade away Al Jefferson and this is what happens. Even if they get Wiggins, Randle, Parker or Gordon in the draft they're going to need so much more to get back to respectability. I still can't believe this is an actual NBA roster.
donald::John Lucas must have compromising pictures of all members of the Jazz front office
KevinS::No, but the Jazz will get Parker.
Ken::Even the losers/get lucky sometimes.  --Tom Petty
NW X::This Blazers fan thanks you for trading Robin Lopez! just what we needed.
PKM::Favors is killing my fantasy team with his bad shooting.
Alex::Gordon Hayward has to be the future here.
