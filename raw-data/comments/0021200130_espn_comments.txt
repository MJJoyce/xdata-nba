Wrong wrong wrong::someone tell dwight he looks stupid with the headband
2PacAmaru1::Sick of Howard always laughing and smiling already!  Get mean like Public Enemy and Charles Barkley!
epitome1986::still don't understand how the lakers are 4-5 it seems like every game the refs hand the lakers twice as many free throws to the lakers.
YearOfTheSpur::Typical Kobe shooting 10-24 and still gets 31pts. How? Ask Dan Crawford and the refs... David Stern has given these sorry $@%!.s the EASIEST shedule and their still 4-5 LOL. Cant wait till Nets and Grizzlies play yall this week, yall better hope the games dont show on TNT or Espn, its gonna be an embarresment haha Spurs 7-2 ;)
epitome1986::exactly! this is odd specially because kobe seems to get fouled a lot on clean blocks and small contact during his jump shots. ive never seen any other jump shooter go to the free throw line as much.
xmanfolife::Nothing wrong with up tempo...at the end of the day it's all about getting stops &amp; rebounds.......that decides titles.
xmanfolife::Saw Bynum grinning on Philly's sideline......guess they do have a bank n Philly.  Safe to say the Lakers came up on the Howard deal...
ohio herd::Dantoni now 1-0!
ohio herd::more wins to come.
Terry 1953::and
Terry 1953::and
rohan_joseph84::when last has a young team won a championship? i keep seeing post about lakers old. the big 3 been to two titles , with an older group than lakers have now, nash being an exception at 38 who else on the celtics core was 20-32 except rondo? there first ring kg was 33 piecre 32 allen 33 rondo 23 and there other guys were like late 20's
Maschil::yep i think the heat have one of the oldest teams
rohan_joseph84::even the heats won with old guys, wade is 30 and batttier 34 miller 33, haslem 32, i mean common emhn old teams is who win in basketball not young teams
lakers will be 2013 champs::kobe shooting 41% from 3 point land and leads the leuge with most points per 48 minutes with 35.4
rohan_joseph84::and heats beat one team over 500
rohan_joseph84::its funny how they say lakers havnt beaten a team over 500 when the heats only beat denver who is over 500 smh. since brown left lakers are like 3-1 and shouldf have beaten spurs. great shot (danny green) he just threw it up ) llol
sand4850::LAKERS: STILL HAVENT BEATEN A TEAM OVER .500. LMAO
xmanfolife::Guess he doesn't understand the season has just started.....
Philip Rivers Needs To Stop Choking::Gsw was 3-2 mad???
Our President Can Ball::Lakers are a charity case.  The Lakers will not win the Championship because they are not that good.
lakers will be 2013 champs::bs
GrizTitan::Clippers&gt; Lakers
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::No prob.
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::The Clippers are a better team (record wise) for the time being. Thanks for acknowledging that.
GrizTitan::Better is BETTER. Thanks for responding.
RealityIsntPerception::So acknowledging D'antoni is better than Phil makes me a Heat troll? I guess Jim Buss is a Heat troll too then, eh?
Jinxster247::d has yet succeeded with no team but suns so lets wait and see. phill is loads better then d but i see y lakers felt d fit better with this laker squad.
mark35345::What really irks me is that Gasol and KG butted heads 2 years ago in the finals. Since then, why has an older KG been so much more productive than a younger Gasol? Effort and Grit and Determination. Gasol is a complacent, yellow, b&amp;%ch...KG still desires a ring - Pau retired after two...
Jayson Murillo::Gasol 2012 Stats-17 PPG and 12 RPG  KG 2012 Stats-16 PPG and 8 RPG  No other way to put it then your a dumbasss
freroht::That's definitely not a good way to look at it. Gasol is a major liability on the defensive side, while Garnett is worth more than 10 points for the Celtics
RealityIsntPerception::Euro players have been known to decline big time at 30 ie  Kukoc, Turkoglu, Peja, etc
RealityIsntPerception::D'antoni Nash and Amare are a match made in heaven! Trade Pau for Amare NOWWWWW
RealityIsntPerception::Dantoni keeps Amare cool because he keeps him involved.. Amare will be back and better than ever. He's only 30
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::Comparing Nash's and Antoni's contract to Amare's is apples to oranges. There's a big free agency coming up in 2014 and I'm quite sure the Lakers don't want a 32 year old Amare holding them down. Besides, Dwight Howard  is an upgrade over Amare. The Lakers don't need two of them.
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::Again, Amare has three years left on his contract. I don't believe the Lakers will take in any trades with contracts going past the 2013-14 season.
RealityIsntPerception::That fits in perfect with Nash and Dantonis contracts, hmmmm
nba is the worst::Just when you thought you'd seen it all as far as ESPN NBA chat, this heat fan starts trolling laker boards with "D'Antoni &gt; Phil Jackson" isht.  Too funny!
mark35345::Why would we want Amare when we just got rid of Glass Knees Bynum?
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::The NBA roster must have at least 12 players on their roster.
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::@Mark35345 - I agree. I also think Gasol will excel a bit more when Nash comes back.
mark35345::We all are hoping Nash's game will motivate Gasol to be more productive! We also need to get rid of roster spots who don't play - we need 9-10 guys to run with D'Antoni on a nightly basis..
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::Gasol's presence itself makes a difference and would prefer his presence over Amare's (in regards to defense)
mark35345::Sure, as long as Gasol doesn't hesitate to shoot (Like quarter 1 last night) and if he beats the boards like he did against the Warriors. He's just so inconsistent...but he can be a type of architect on offense (like Nash) but he needs to hit the boards more often...
RealityIsntPerception::maybe because pau sucks and has averaged 13 pts on 40 percent shooting the last 2 years in the playoffs and because amare is a perfect fit with nash and dantoni
Martin Seamus McFly::So has Stoudemire.
mark35345::Yes, Gasol has gone downhill since 2010 that's a fact.
mark35345::But he misses too many games and once again like Bynum is immature - punching a fire extinguisher in the playoffs? No thank you....
RealityIsntPerception::Oh crap.. I just thought of the perfect trade.... Gasol for AMAREEEEEEEE
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::In that case, why would New York want a struggling Pau Gasol for a younger Amare. Also, does Amare have three years left on his contract? If so, I don't believe the Lakers want to carry any big contracts past 2014 for the exception of resigning Dwight Howard.
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::If the Lakers were to trade Gasol, think they should try for bench pieces or someone like a Josh Smith. Amare's been injury prone for quite a while now.
mark35345::The only problem with Josh Smith is that we'd then have two Artests on the team. Two players who in any given half of b-ball can shoot 0-10. And Smith's knee is in worse shape than Artest's....but a healthy Smith can pass and drive and play defense?
RealityIsntPerception::and gasols been struggling and 2 years older. Why would hawks want pau? amares  younger  and would work well with nash and dantoni. you have to look at deals that both teams would want
Clueless Heat Fan::^
RealityIsntPerception::Phil: Hey guys Kobe: Go write another book, old man Jim Buss: We're going in another direction Jeanie Buss: It's not you Phil...... I have a crush on someone else... and his name is Mikey   Conference call this past Monday
Clueless Heat Fan::^
RealityIsntPerception::D'antoni doesn't win when it matters? 2 and 0 vs Phil in playoff series. Came back from 3-1 in 06 to destroy Phil and dominated with 4-1 vs Phil in 07. Playoffs matter buddy and Phil's never beaten D'antoni head to head in ANYTHING
FishingWithFredo::Another Koberific, Kobetastic performance by the greatest player in NBA history...29,726 down, 8662 to go.  Remember the "The Lakers should have traded Kobe instead of Shaq" Gumps from seven years ago?  *points and laughs*
Maschil::yep....i do wish shaq took better care of his health though
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::I think both of them were equally disrespectful towards each other.
MiamiMagicCity::if kobe wasnt so disrespectful he and shaq could of won three more
RealityIsntPerception::Phil should've known he was toast when Lakers management told him... We''ll get back to you in 7 seconds or less....
RealityIsntPerception::Mike dreams of Jeanie... and D'antoni always  achieves his dreams when it comes to competing vs fat Phil
RealityIsntPerception::D'antoni stole the job from fat Phil  in 7 seconds or less!
truetotheend2.0::like your performance in the sack
nba is the worst::You're Mike's brother, right?
RealityIsntPerception::Brother from another mother. Can't grow a moustache as good as that guy.. but neither can Phil... Or youuuuu
scottpilgrim33::O look the refs helped the Lakers to another win. Kobe going to the line 11 times? Pluhzeee. someone had money on this game
RealityIsntPerception::Phil should go coach the Knicks. He has a lot in common with Melo. Both fat. Both leech off others to win. Both overrated, Both just plain old suck! D'antoni and Mamba 4 life!!
truetotheend2.0::i bet you said the same thing about Mike Brown.  Kobe will NEVER sniff the Finals again.
truetotheend2.0::i don't have to prove anything.  D'Antoni has never won when it mattered.
RealityIsntPerception::way to backtrack and change the goal post. You get proven wrong so you change your theory instead of taking accountability for your FAIL. You're owned like Phil
truetotheend2.0::that explains the comments.  Loser is what loser does
RealityIsntPerception::lol, I've always hated brown and Phil: D'antonis always been my favorite coach. Too bad we didnt have money on that bet, sonny boy
scottpilgrim33::Steve Nash faking an injury so he doesn't have to play for a sorry @$$ squad. Can;t blame him
RealityIsntPerception::D'antoni is gong to get his sweet revenge on Melo by winning three straight titles!
truetotheend2.0::not with this OLD group of players.
bob0000010::Let's see him win 1 lol
RealityIsntPerception::When the moon meets your eye like 5 straight Laker titles, THATS D"ANTONI!!!!!!!!!!
bob0000010::Over 100 points allowed already. Great Defensive coaching by Mike Antoni!
Lakersgetterdone::Last 20 posts on this FORUM -&gt; LAKER HATERS   The game ended last night morons
truetotheend2.0::then why are you here?
RealityIsntPerception::Hey, all you Magic Johnson wannabes. Get off Phil's lap already. He can't beat D'antoni head to head in ANYTHING!  Get over it!!!
bob0000010::lol. Antoni can't a ring
RealityIsntPerception::Hey Phil, don't worry. Maybe you can coach FIsher and Fox in the NBDL you overrated bum. This team belongs to DANTONI
bob0000010::Sure, if they don't want to win
choate_sedition::Lakers will get undone by their bench, they have no one who can get a surprise 20, they should trade gasol for pieces
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::I have plenty of insight on the game of basketball. Don't question my knowledge when you don't know me. Do yourself a favor and hang out on your own team's board.
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::Anyone on the bench can get a "surprise" 20 if all it means is that a bench player has a good day. Consistancy is questionable however, but with the Lakers starting lineup, I don't think that's a priority for any of the bench players to produce that much. I would like to see Meeks, Jamison and Hill produce close to 10-12 ppg and the Lakers as a team will be fine. Under Mike D'Antoni's new offense, if lack of bench production is a problem, then trading a starter like Gasol for better bench production would definitely be optional.
truetotheend2.0::you make it seem like the Lakers can just trade and get who they want.    You are a blind fan with no insight.  The Lakers are stuck with what they have and they have 19th  best record in the league.
RealityIsntPerception::Playoff series Head to Head D'antoni 2  Phil 0  Being  picked for Lakers coaching spot Head to Head D'antoni 1   Phil 0  Better moustache D'antoni  What's next? Mike dreams of JEANIEEEEEEEEE
nba is the worst::Still boring
RealityIsntPerception::Phil who?
truetotheend2.0::yet when Phil won titles you were all over his jock.  Get over it dude.
RealityIsntPerception::are you magic johnson or something? get off phils lap. Phil can't beat D'antoni head to head in ANYTHING
RealityIsntPerception::D'antoni is the best coach ever. Get lost Phil.  Have fun being shocked by Dantoni. First he shocked you by coming back from 3-1 against you in 06 and then followed it up with a 4-1 dominance in 07. Now he shocked you by being the first choice for the Lakers coaching spot. OWNED PHIL,OWNED
sand4850::"AS LONG AS WE CAN KEEP PLAYING THE PISTONS KINGS WARRIORS AND SUNS WE'LL HAVE NO PROBLEMS." -JORDAN HILL
truetotheend2.0::Can't teach OLD dogs new tricks. Especially when the the tires are thin.     Lakers don't get a pass on age just because they are the Lakers.
JeremyLin10timeAllStar::I like Jordan Hill's plays. Lakers are lucky to have him.
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::Yes we are! Like his hustle.
RealityIsntPerception::D'antoni 2 and 0 vs Phil in playoff series (ie 06 and 07). D'antoni takes Phil's job and leaves him in shock. D'antoni owns that overrated piece of crap Phil..Mike and Jeanie would make a cute couple, eh?
nba is the worst::This was dumb the 1st time, and boring the 2nd  Phil is rated the best NBA coach of all time by most, 'Antoni rated a laughing stock..
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::Laughing stock??? Okay, he's no Phil Jackson, but labeling him as "laughing stock" is a bit overboard.
J1133B::I'm a real fan, I support MY Team so I spend my time on other team's pages.  - I'm not a troll Moron

sand4850::YEA DAMN RIGHT SCREW THE FAKERSS!! WON AGAINST ANOTHER LOTTERY TEAM AND THEY THINK THEYRE THE ISH
Kobe 6-24 Game 7 Finals::They won against another garbage team.
RealityIsntPerception::What a difference D'antoni's schemes make! Phil who?
Kobe 6-24 Game 7 Finals::Phil 11 championships and Mike "no defense" D'Antoni 0.
RealityIsntPerception::D'antoni 2 and 0 vs phil in playoff series. Now he stole his job......You know, Mike and Jeanie would make a cute couple......
Clueless Heat Fan::Heat fan?
RealityIsntPerception::Dantoni fan!
kobepac24::Kobe shooting % wont last.  The Lakers will score but cant play D.  Lakers have no bench.   Things haters say when their fear is showing.
MattRomney::this is a much better system than the Princeton.  You can't ask NBA players to play shut down defense for 82 48 minute regular season games with a 24 second shot clock.
kobepac24::As a Laker fan i must admit D'Antoni's focus on D is suspect. But with Howard and Kobe and Metta i'll give him the benifit of the doubt. I didn't like the 57 points at the half but they did hold them to 18 in the 4th which is where you really want your D to show up. Yeah its just the Suns but progress is progress. Gotta start some where.
Member_of_Lakers_Nation_Since_1987::Sure, 57 points at the half is high, but keep in mind that the Phoenix Suns had more possessions with the ball, due to both teams playing with an uptempo offense. It was a relief to see this Lakers team play with some fire last night. Also, the bench played to their abilities and that was a good sign.
The Timmy Duncan Satanic Cult::Life is good for the Lakers. They hose the 76ers and score Dwight, who has no extensive injury history, especially since he was faking that back injury business
nba is the worst::dumb for 2 reasons
