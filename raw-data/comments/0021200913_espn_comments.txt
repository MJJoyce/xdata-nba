NY NBK Far Superior x.::only 1pt win without Melo and Stat playing hurt.
JAHoyes::Durant - Refs = PICKING LEAFS OUT THE RAIN GUTTER IN UNDERSIZED PAJAMAS
GEORGE W. BUSH IS MOST BELOVED PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME::meLO:  WTF FATON, I TOLD YOU TO STOP FEEDING ME NUGGETS AND FRIES!  LOOK WHAT IT DID TO MY TORN MCL!  FATON:  OOPS MY BAD!  BUT LOOK AT IT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE...MORE NUGGETS AND FRIES TO MYSELF!  YES!!! YES!!! ;)

scape228::Everybody wants to be like Mike, and be a hero at the end of games. It's so stupid. Seriously professional basketball teams can't come up with something better at the end of games than to  give the ball to your best or hottest player and see if he can hit a contested jumper?
RUMBLEizmyWINGMAN::wow epic game.. glad we came up on top.. but was worried for a sec there
Donnie Walsh::JR Giveth And JR Taketh Away !!!  Don't Blame Him - Blame The Coach !!! Can't believe that was the play a Timeout was called for !!! LMAO
pitchersandcatchers1967::anyone watching the All Star Celebrity Apprentice?   H I L A R I O U S !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Daytona_600::Is Lebron playing today? I want to see a really entertaining basketball game.
kitastrophy34::Yea, B/c real entertainment consists of people making left turns repetitively...
Daytona_600::Im just out here gettn' BUCKETS on there youngbloods
Bamm7272::JR Smith. Mr. Unclutch  However, with Melo they probably lose by 10
kitastrophy34::Get off his back, JR had a great game...
SweetDaddy42::It's not how you start, it's how you finish.
Seskatchewan::As an OKC fan, Knicks without Melo are scarier than Knicks with....
I prefer boxers over briefs::Yep - OKC would have KILLED the Knics if MElo had played.
TaylorMaize::I just sold Kevin Durant a new car.
TaylorMaize::Yeah I was just testing if my account was still banned and was reading an article about buying a new car.  Enjoy your Royals games this year.
kitastrophy34::you lie, like all Americans, he doesn't go to Detroit unless he is forced to...
369171833::for traveling?
369171833::Times, etc. always get a little better but it has as much to do with shoes and tracks as the athlete themselves.   If you are talking basketball you add in the abilty to know how to play and desire and today's players are light years behind the players of the 80s. Some of the years Wilt Chamberlian played,  Dwight Howard was not as good as his back-up!
LES 989::Knicks would have been much better if they kept Gallo and WChandler with more cap room.  Now they are capped out with no assets facing another rebuilding because they arent good enough.  Thats what happens with a meddlesome owner Dolan will never win a ring.
the_alba_bang::Hey look, I got respect for my elders and all, but you guys are batsh1t crazy with all this Wilt, Bo Jackson are better and faster than atheletes nowadays talk.
the_alba_bang::And in 20 years the atheletes are gonna be even better, but I won't be denying that. There is some fetus right now who in 22 years is going to make Lebron James look like Kwame Brown.
TedBroosevelt::Your logic is not good either bud.  He compared Lebron to Kwame Brown, who play different positions. As far as I know, Lebron isn't a center. And he didn't say it would be exactly 22 years either.
Yup I am here.::?  Your theory is not good.  Shaq came to the NBA in 92. In 2 years there will be a more athletic, more powerful center than Shaq?
keyzersozee::Um bo Jackson ran a 4.12 40. That is
kitastrophy34::Bo was the strongest and fastest and thats a fact JACK!  -Psi Robertson
Yup I am here.::You are correct
keyzersozee::keyzersozee - Um bo Jackson ran a 4.12 40. That is  And Wilt had a legit 48 inch vetical and 500 lb. bench?
robonic30::There are certain Athletes that transcend their era 's but in general Todays Athletes are far superior!
Yup I am here.::What?   "You don't know Bo"
Yup I am here.::Bo ran a 4.12 at the combine..  Anyone do that lately?
the_alba_bang::AP tore an ACL, then came back 6 months later and was 9 yards away from breaking a record.
the_alba_bang::Bo knows. Or rather Bo knew until he blew his hip out.
kitastrophy34::Durant could dominate a game without getting a single call. He's a transcendent talent and already one of the greatest players of his generation.He's also claiming an ungodly 9.3 free throws per game. That's an incredible number when you consider that KD made his way as an off-the-catch shooter. He's not a center, and he doesn't dominate the ball, yet he gets to the line. Obviously some of that has to do with Durant's slick, much-improved handle. Some of it has to do with defenders fouling him because they don't know what else to do against such virtuosity. A lot of it, frankly, is related to how smart Kevin Durant is at selling calls.  STOP CRYING ABOUT THE REFS!
Westjag::I've been to other boards and I seriously think the NBA boards have the most trolls/haters.
kitastrophy34::yes they do
kitastrophy34::If it's not Michael Jordan getting the calls it's Pippen, If its not Lebron its Dwade, if its not Kobe its Pau... grow up!
kitastrophy34::Only on a convo board will you find a bunch of grown men acting like babies crying about officiating
crabtrjf::I think you're the only guy who wants to keep bringing up officiating .. and KD gets calls. They'll make that arm sweep of his more illegal after this season so it'll be tougher
Westjag::Haters.
crabtrjf::Yeah, he sells calls well. Helps that a strong breeze blows him over.
Yup I am here.::I am sorry. No
rex_coach::<b>  LMAO!!!!!</b>
robonic30::Todays Athletes are better than Yesterdays - that is a Fact isnt it ?
crabtrjf::In general, yes that's certainly a fact. Plus with the game being international the NBA level of play is higher
TheWyseWon::Not exacrly sure when but sometimes in the  1990s athletes peaked
TheWyseWon::Team athletes...I mean.  It involves knowing how to play and desire as well as physical ability
crabtrjf::o.O  Maybe to the nastalgic. Athletes are always improving. WRs are always being broken
Yup I am here.::Definitely not smarter. Fundamentals are lacking
robonic30::Anyone faster than Bolt ?
Yup I am here.::that's one. But the better athletes are in yesteryear as a whole
Yup I am here.::Any runner better than Bo iin his prime?
Yup I am here.::Foster? Yeah right
Yup I am here.::lol, I feel you. i am talking about today
keyzersozee::TheWyseWon - Jimmy Brown  Greatest LAX player ever too
the_alba_bang::Foster for Houston. Fastest clocked 40 at the combine, ever...
TheWyseWon::Jimmy Brown
robonic30::Faster , stronger , smarter
Yup I am here.::Anyone faster than Deion in his prime yet?
Yup I am here.::Yeah Deion ran a 4.21 and Chris ran a 4.25.  You are right. bo ran a 4.12
keyzersozee::Yup I am here. - Chris Johnson ran a 4.2 at the combine, but Deion ran a 4.1 at that combine  You are correct. Chris Johnson. Deion ran a 4.2. But Bo Jackson is alleged to have run a 4.12. But the same week ran a 4.18.
Yup I am here.::Chris Johnson ran a 4.2 at the combine, but Deion ran a 4.1 at that combine
Yup I am here.::......  I am talking about the new electronic equipment.. Stay with me here
the_alba_bang::New equipment? Oh, you mean we got new type legs now with electronics that plays mp3 huh?
keyzersozee::Yup I am here. - Yeah they set the record for fastest with the new equipment. Not faster than Sanders  Game speed v not Game also. It was more a question thought someone ran like a 4.2
Yup I am here.::Yeah they set the record for fastest with the new equipment. Not faster than Sanders
keyzersozee::Thought someone 2 years ago set the combine record.
keyzersozee::I thought til someone told me the stats on Wilt. 500lb bench 7'1" 300 lbs. 48 in vert. 10 second 100?
robonic30::The olympics prove that !
Yup I am here.::Nope.
the_alba_bang::Yeah it is, but for some it's healthier for them to bask in nostalgia rather than logic.
Children of a Worthless God::The Knicks are going to face either Boston or Chicago in the playoffs. Predictions, anyone?
Yup I am here.::Tough for the Knicks with either team
Children of a Worthless God::To be honest, I think the Knicks would be better off without Carmelo.
TheWyseWon::I still love the Isiah Thomas quote when he met Wilt Chamberlain during the 50 greatest player ceremony.   Isiah who had played in the 80s and against some of the best and biggest ever said,  "There is BIG and then there is Wilt Chamberlain BIG"
JoeBuck Yourself::Speedy Claxton + Raja Bell + Aaron McKie. Best "Big 3" in NBA history. Fact.
Yup I am here.::lol. All those players had D though
Banned_because_of_stupid_Nascar_LBJGOAT::29 shot attempt coming off the bench= The Kobe System
rex_coach::<b>Kobe on the brain from these band wagon heat fans... lol</b>
keyzersozee::LOL is that was Smith had?
crabtrjf::Notice Durant out FT'd the knicks by himself .. didn't watch the game tho so I can't judge. He does get some nice calls though
Yup I am here.::KD gets a lot of calls.
Yup I am here.::It is not just the knicks though. He gets a lot of calls against anyone
keyzersozee::I only watched the 4th and it was to get the Knicks in the bonus. That padded it some.
keyzersozee::you gotta consider Smith had a ton of points from 3
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::interesting convo but I gotta go to lunch.  hopefuly you guys are still here when I get back in an hr or so?
Corvo Attano::it takes you an hour to eat?
keyzersozee::U rush to go back to work :p
cdub2103::Just imagine how many chicks Wilt would have banged if he had twitter and sexting. You just cant compare this generations numbers to 40 years ago.
rondo2KG::you are making great point after great point.
the_alba_bang::We also got AIDS now.... so, yeah, um, dont forget about the variables.
cdub2103::But now we have condoms, and if you have enough money like Magic Johsnon you can apparently cure it
Corvo Attano::either okc is way overrated or the knicks are a better team without melo.  pick one.
D_train2724::either you know nothing about basketball or you have crap for brains. pick one
cjones191::gotta remember it was a road game for okc though
cjones191::i personally think the knicks work better without melo
robonic30::Can someone just invent a Time Machine and we can settle this argument !!!!!!!!
keyzersozee::Can go fwd. Not back. They proved it.
jrtall3n7::other way around. the past is static, you can visit it... the future is too uncertain
rondo2KG::Wilt would have eaten Dwight Howard alive. Dude was a straight up savage on the court.
keyzersozee::Just posted. Has 2 inches and an 8 inch vert on him. It is a joke, and Wilt could shoot also apparently (did not know, changes my mind about GOAT):  "his league-leading 8.6 assist-per-game season tops the best season ever submitted by (to name a fairly random cross-section of guards and forwards) Derek Fisher (4.4 APG), Tony Parker (6.9 APG), Michael Jordan (8.0 APG), Larry Bird (7.6 APG), Penny Hardaway (7.2 APG), or Derrick Rose (7.8 APG), all of whom are generally considered to be better passers. Wilt is almost indisputably the best passing center ever and the combination of his dominance inside and his passing abilities made him a fantastic teammate to have on the floor"
robonic30::against who ??
Yup I am here.::Who has Howard played against? This is not the 90's
cdub2103::Guys like Durant and Lebron have been bread to be basketball players since they were like 6 years old. Just imagine if Wilt, Russel, et. al. were training the way these guys are today.
TheWyseWon::another great point
Yup I am here.::This is how you know people do not know what they are talking about:  Wilt was a track star that high jumped 6'6", From a stationary jump position he jumped 22 feet, as a preteen he ran 440 yards in 49 secs, 880 yards in 2 minutes, and while at Kansas he ran a sub-11 seconds in the 100 meters
SweetDaddy42::People keep saying "Dwight, Dwight".  Dwight wouldn't have been an elite center 20 years ago.
Yup I am here.::Heck no. He is not even better than Zo to me and Zo was not mentioned with Robinson, Shaq, Hakeem
robonic30::u copied and pasted - lame
Yup I am here.::That was a point I made earlier. Scroll down to see I copied and pasted myself.  You are lame for not realizing that fact
robonic30::Wilt is an exception but aside from Russell name some stars he played against - just off the top of your head
TheWyseWon::There were 8-9 teams.  Imagine that many teams today and how good the players would be.  Chamberlain played against Russell 18 times a season in the regular season and sometimes 7 more times in the playoffs.  Not twice a year like Kobe Vs. leBron, etc.
Yup I am here.::And if you are going to say that then Dwight must not be anything much because the Center position is watered down these days
Yup I am here.::People Wilt Chamberlain played against Nate Thurmond: Averaged 15 pts 15 rebs a game (14,000 points, 14,000 rebs) Walt Bellamy: Averaged 20 pts 14 rebs a game (21,000 points, 14,000 rebs) Kareem Abdul Jabbar: 7'2" Dennis Awtrey: 6'11" Walt Bellamy: 6'11" Tom Boerwinkle: 7'0" Nate Bowmen: 6'11" Mel Counts: 7'0" Walter Dukes: 7'0" Jim Eakins: 6'11" Ray Felix: 6'11" Hank Finkel: 7'0" Artis Gilmore: 7'2" Swede Halbrook: 7'3" Reggie Harding: 7'0" Bob Lanier: 6'11" Jim McDaniels: 6'11" Otto Moore: 6'11" Dave Newmark: 7'0" Rich Niemann: 7'0" Billy Paultz: 6'11" Craig Raymond: 6'11" Elmore Smith: 7'0" Chuck Share: 6'11" Ronald Taylor: 7'1" Nate Thurmond: 6'11" Walt Wesley: 6'11"
SweetDaddy42::100 yards, but I completely agree.
Yup I am here.::my bad lol
TheWyseWon::w/o the benefit of today's shoes, tracks, and training.
Yup I am here.::Exactly
Yup I am here.::So how is Chandler or Howard as athletic as he was?
Yup I am here.::Howard is nothing compared to Wilt. All people say is Wilt only had Russell to play against...  Well who has dwight had? The Center position is watered down now
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::come on son, lol.  don't ask questions like that.  I'm not saying Wilt would suck against today's players, but stop.  Dwight is like Megatron but taller
TheWyseWon::Chamberlain was also way stronger than either of them
Yup I am here.::He would get bodied? He was 280. Chandler is not as strong he is  nor as big
SweetDaddy42::Simple, they aren't.
the_alba_bang::He would get bodied.
keyzersozee::Ok I was reading up. Wilt had a 50 inch vertical almost and was 7'1 and 300. He would dominate.
SweetDaddy42::Both
the_alba_bang::Hilarious. Don't be going all Pat Summit on me now, old man.
SweetDaddy42::Again, He ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9 seconds, shot-putted 56 feet, triple jumped more than 50 feet, and won the high jump in the Big Eight track and field championships three straight years.
the_alba_bang::I've seen footage of Wilt and his moves. They were dominant back then, but bring that ish to the NBA now and they would send him packing back to Overbrook HS. he was strong, but strenght wont get you to the stars alone. His compettiton was not as athletic and superior than the comp now. My basis - the dude scored 100 points. 100 points!!!! That's not happening nowadays even if he played 50 games straight against the Bobcats. The comp was weaker/slower/ etc... Put Wilt up against some of the hogs of the 90's or the Chandler's, Howards, and Bynums of today, and old man will get ran out the house.
keyzersozee::the_alba_bang - He would still be a mediocre center at best in today's league. Dude would get bodied. his league-leading 8.6 assist-per-game season tops the best season ever submitted by (to name a fairly random cross-section of guards and forwards) Derek Fisher (4.4 APG), Tony Parker (6.9 APG), Michael Jordan (8.0 APG), Larry Bird (7.6 APG), Penny Hardaway (7.2 APG), or Derrick Rose (7.8 APG), all of whom are generally considered to be better passers. Wilt is almost indisputably the best passing center ever and the combination of his dominance inside and his passing abilities made him a fantastic teammate to have on the floor
the_alba_bang::Are you 42 or was that the year you were born in?
keyzersozee::the_alba_bang - He would still be a mediocre center at best in today's league. Dude would get bodied.  I change my mind. He also benched 500 lbs. You should consider. A dude that big, and strong, and with a 48 in vert? Who actually could shoot?  V. Howard  Wilt has two inches and around 25 pounds on Dwight and his vertical may be as much as eight inches greater. Dwight is very strong, but Wilt was likely stronger.  Wilt has greater size, greater athleticism and greater strength.
SweetDaddy42::Shouldn't you be in school?
the_alba_bang::He would still be a mediocre center at best in today's league. Dude would get bodied.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::No disrespect, but Wilt in today's game is the equivalent of Tyson Chandler with post moves
SweetDaddy42::He ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9 seconds, shot-putted 56 feet, triple jumped more than 50 feet, and won the high jump in the Big Eight track and field championships three straight years.[
LeBrons Foreheads Parking Space::He'd be a black Gheorghe Muresan
SweetDaddy42::It's not an apples to apples comparison.
cdub2103::Who is that disrespectful to? If Tyson Chandler had post moves, he'd be an MVP candidate.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I figured some Wilt fans would take it the wrong way.  I agree, I actually think if NY were to somehow lock up the 2 seed and go on like a 12 game win streak, you'd have to consider Tyson anyways.  But that won't happen sadly lol.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::Tyson is just as athletic if not moreso than Wilt.  Wilt had a much better post game, thus he'd basically be somewhere near Dwight in his prime, but less athletic
TheWyseWon::Not sure if this is true, but someone said awhile back that Wilt still holds some track records at Kansas
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::what was his .40 cuz "college" for Wilt was like 60 yrs ago
rondo2KG::not. even. close. lol  watch wilt clips on youtube.  unbelievable.
SweetDaddy42::Not even close.  Wilt was an All-American track star in college.
brattwurst n mustard::exactly - but ibaka could punch wilt in his speed bag and break his knuckles
SweetDaddy42::Not if Wilt grew up today.
Yup I am here.::Why do you say that? Tyson can not do the things Wilt could
Darth Invade Her::B-)
Darth Invade Her::I think the Knicks will go past the first round... nahhhh first round exits once again baby!
robonic30::The game has evolved a lot since the 60's - like calculators compared to Modern PC's !
TheWyseWon::not really...  the players were more intelligent and the real good ones were about as athletic.   The game is terribly watered down today and hardly anybody knows how to play.
robonic30::Those old calculators couldnt process the mind numbing numbers todays PC's can
SweetDaddy42::Yes, and if kept in perspective, the calculator is every bit as important and valuable.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::LeBron and MJ could've avg'd 60+ppg in the 60's/70's
TheWyseWon::LOL.  LeBron would be knocked over every time he tried to drive and push people over like he gets away with today.  Players would not have allowed him to do it.  He would have been a grea player, but about the way he is today
keyzersozee::I actually tend to agree. IF the pay was the same. Cuz guys would do anything to keep up. Austin Carr talks about it all the time. The one thing they wouldn't is try and injure each other cuz that was their living.
robonic30::Kwame Brown would have been a superstar in the 60's
the_alba_bang::Westbrook would abuse Frazier on the dribble drive like he did Kobe and Nash the other night. Rose and Monta Ellis would do the same.
TheWyseWon::Walt Frazier could guard anybody in today's game (guards) and stop them
the_alba_bang::compared to players now... ... yes, they were. Put Earl and Walt up against Westbrook and Rondo and them old cats will get smoked.
Yup I am here.::? Earl "the Pearl" was slow?  Walt Frazier was slow?
the_alba_bang::damn right. Back then, the athletes weren't as superior and the game and players weren't as advanced. I mean, just look at how slow the average player was back then. It's like watching chess.
robonic30::All day
cdub2103::Players that would still dominate today, 80s or earlier: Wilt Cousy Frazier Pistol Pete The Big O Jerry West Russel
keyzersozee::Pistol Pete unfortunately didn't dominate then. Healthy I agree. He was what like 90% for 3 in his last year (first year for 3 pt?). Watching the stuff he did is insane.
keyzersozee::cdub2103 - I think he would be even better these days. His game is built like Rondo. A stat filler, facilitator.  Don't disagree. He kinda got screwed by teams and injury is what I meant.
cdub2103::I think he would be even better these days. His game is built like Rondo. A stat filler, facilitator.
the_alba_bang::riiiiiight...........
Yup I am here.::People Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell played against Nate Thurmond: Averaged 15 pts 15 rebs a game (14,000 points, 14,000 rebs) Walt Bellamy: Averaged 20 pts 14 rebs a game (21,000 points, 14,000 rebs) Kareem Abdul Jabbar: 7'2" Dennis Awtrey: 6'11" Walt Bellamy: 6'11" Tom Boerwinkle: 7'0" Nate Bowmen: 6'11" Mel Counts: 7'0" Walter Dukes: 7'0" Jim Eakins: 6'11" Ray Felix: 6'11" Hank Finkel: 7'0" Artis Gilmore: 7'2" Swede Halbrook: 7'3" Reggie Harding: 7'0" Bob Lanier: 6'11" Jim McDaniels: 6'11" Otto Moore: 6'11" Dave Newmark: 7'0" Rich Niemann: 7'0" Billy Paultz: 6'11" Craig Raymond: 6'11" Elmore Smith: 7'0" Chuck Share: 6'11" Ronald Taylor: 7'1" Nate Thurmond: 6'11" Walt Wesley: 6'11"
keyzersozee::Didn't Wilt say if he played today (like 3 yrs ago) he'd avg 50 a game? LOL
the_alba_bang::Wilt's been dead since the 90s
Yup I am here.::When did Wilt pass? I know it was not 3 years ago
the_alba_bang::doesn' prove anything.
Yup I am here.::It proves that they were not just playing agaiinst "small white guys"
TheWyseWon::It proves they played against people with size.  Chamberlain and Russell met about 18 times a seaosn during the regular season.
keyzersozee::Wow are OKC and the Spurs seriously 3-1 and 6-1 wow. So if I can afford to lose 200 I can bet 100 on each and at least win 100 in the end by taking them v the Heat?
TheWyseWon::Players don't know how to play the game today like they did years ago.  Anyone who doesn't think Wilt Chamberlain would dominate in today's game, never saw him play or know absolutely nothing about the game.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::Wilt would be good, but do you honestly think he'd score 100 points on any of today's defenses?  With no 3point line!? lol
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::@keysersozee Agreed 100%
TheWyseWon::You are talking about 1 game.  Maybe not score a 100 or even 50 in a season, but he would be 30+ points and around 20 rebounds
keyzersozee::I am saying it's more impressive to score 81 today as a wing
keyzersozee::There are other 7 foot guys. I'd say the same about anyone not getting a wing player scoring 81 is more impressive than a freakishly big dude scoring 100.
texrcana24::Your correct to an extent but you are also kidding yourself if you think that players today aren't more athletic than players of yesteryear.  I'm not saying Wilt couldn't play today because I'm sure he could but to say players today don't know how to play the game, I would have to disagree.
SweetDaddy42::Completely agree.  Not the same gaudy numbers, but still dominant.
robonic30::Wilt is an exception but he wouldnt have those ridiculous stats today !No way
brattwurst n mustard::chamberlain would be a bench player in today's game...he made his mark by being the biggest player of his time.
brattwurst n mustard::wilt was owned by a shorter player from boston...come on.  you his mistress?
Yup I am here.::More athletic than Wilt? No center. And i am even talking about all the Centers SINCE Wilt. Wilt was much more than just a  basketball player
brattwurst n mustard::any center on orlando
TheWyseWon::He would be the biggest player today.  Who's bigger and more athletic than Chamberlian playing today?
Yup I am here.::I agree. I also know that Wilt and Russell played against many players 6'11'' and above, unlike today
pitchersandcatchers1967::C ' MON   B A S E B A L L     :)   : )   : )   : )  : )   : )   : )
Yup I am here.::Baseball? man please
robonic30::Baseball is on its deathbed - they need to do something and fast
TheWyseWon::I agree, but What can they do?
brattwurst n mustard::would anybody else like to see upside down naked crucifixions during halftime?
pitchersandcatchers1967::NICE SN!
Oaktown1029::really good game. Intense.
keyzersozee::That's how it kills me to deal with the fouls and commercials.
rondo2KG::I will root for even the $@%!$@% Knicks if it means taking out the Heat or Lakers.  God this website sweats those two teams more than anyone...
robonic30::Knicks get a lot of attetion too- just not as much
SweetDaddy42::There's a reason for that.  If the Knicks were actually any good, trust me, ESPN would sweat them as well.  This is a business, and NY is the biggest market.
keyzersozee::You have me thinking who matches up best. I gotta say the pacers. But I don't think they win the finals. That'd be weird.
Mary Kelter::Hot chicks make the best picks: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHd4IHwma70
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::Sooner or later they are going to have to update that "50 Greatest Players" list to include guys like Kobe, Dirk, Iverson, etc...But I wonder who is coming off lol?
cdub2103::It was the NBAs 50th anniversary when they made the top 50 list, so I doubt they'll drop anyone off. Just make it the top 75 at the 75th anniversary.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::yeah more than likely.  Thats a good way to save face too, because I noticed no one is actually ranked, just 50 total players haha
robonic30::wysewon - your delusional - just think about it
fokman::They probably will just make it the top 75 players
ChiefIlliniwek4Life::I assume they'll stick them where they think they belong, and the guys on the bottom will fall off.
robonic30::I personally think some of those players from the 60's and 70's couldnt play NCAA nowadays
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::@wyse I agree with that statement, which is why you'd have to consider Dirk over one of the guys already on the list.  No question, Iverson is a top 20 player all time, so clearly somebody has to move lol.  And I don't even like Iverson
TheWyseWon::Dirk would be good in any era...not as good as Bird, but guys like Oscar Robvertson, Wilt, Jerry West, etc. would be stars in today's league
SweetDaddy42::That's not correct.  You have to compare them with the competition in which they played.  If we just based it on who would succeed now, most of the older players would drop off.  Because someone from the 50's or 60's couldn't neccesarily thrive now, doesn't make them an any less great player.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::@TheWyseWon, Dirk would be in a simlar class to Larry Bird if they played in the same era.  Not mentally as tough, but statistically/physically he would've fried a lot of guys in the 80s
TheWyseWon::Boby Cousy, Paul Arizin, John Stockton..  Cousy and Stockton remain Top 50 all-time the other shorter white guy probably should come off
rondo2KG::I agree with that 100%...way too many 6 foot white guys lol (I am white also but it is what it is)
TheWyseWon::LOL.  You are way wrong.  The Top players in the 60s were better than the Top Players today...with LeBron being the exception.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::lol yeah I don't think they wanna be disrespectful, but Iverson's stats shy.t on a lot of those older guys lol
brattwurst n mustard::knicks will be destroyed in the playoffs like an ibaka speedbag
NewJerseyDevilsGreatestDynastyEver::Lol at everyone who took OKC -7.5 thinking it was easy cash. Got ya stacks taken!!
keyzersozee::Anyone who gambles on the NBA is a goddamned fool. Even LBJ takes games off. You don't know when. It is moronic.
keyzersozee::kitastrophy34 - I'm up 2k this year and I know when the thunder are going to cover usually...  Pretty impressive. Especially because I remember reading before some pickem survivor league some economist paper about where Vegas is wrong. Usually it's Elite teams at home (they get too many points, that was NFL tho, It kept me above .500 the last few years).  It just worries me how close I watch. Dudes just cruise through games.

ChiefIlliniwek4Life::That's why it's called "gambling".
kitastrophy34::ya, westbrook tweeking his ankle didn't help them on that bet
