chris johnson 558::lol @ some fans want to fire jacque vaughn guys he is playing this season without at least two starters and despite all of this he competed in many games he is a promising coach look at doc rivers first year with the magic
Elton7323::lol to the people saying mkg is better than harkless do u realize he is the 5th rookie in the league for a reason and has better stats than him overall.
I taught Socrates everything he knew::The Magic have a solid young core of Vucevic, Tobias Harris, Moe Harkless, Andrew Nicholson, and E'twuan Moore has shown some promise.  Now they need a PG like Trey Burke or a stud SG and then build around those pieces
derek_510::you can throw o'quinn in that list
derek_510::front court is looking solid in the future, barring trades/signings s&amp;hit
bobcats 2020 nba champs::wiggins might be overrated he dose play highschool ball in canada haha you never know he should dominate them
Elton7323::remember how overrated shabazz muhamid was, he was considered the best in this class now look what happend a few month's later. i hope wiggins isnt the same.
iiMKenny::Lol his father is American though.
iiMKenny::What are you talking about? He plays at Huntington Prep in WV which is the #1 team in the Nation.
bobcats 2020 nba champs::hes at least from canada haha i was close enough
iiMKenny::14-15 Magic Starting Lineup  PG: Smart SG: Wiggins SF Harkless PF: Harris C: Vucevic   Damn that's gonna be a great lineup
bobcats 2020 nba champs::this year in the draft i think we could use another guard but would noel work out with bismac and mullens
Duke 2013 Champs::Mullens is terrible
bobcats 2020 nba champs::nvm mullens dosnt even start i just have a man crush on him
Phatepiclewts::That settles it. The Magic are the worst team in the NBA.
MagicBoltzRays::just tanking for that #1 pick.
Buzzed Killington::Dwight crying about elbows was comical..Just go search Dwight Howard elbows on Youtube and you'll see how dirty he is..I can't believe we used to defend that clown..He has thrown some nasty intentional elbows.
NHLFANZ96::Heat streak good for NBA Chicago playing them TOUGH great for NBA Heinrich take away...priceless!
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Dallas is gona catch the Lakers.
KCromie::Here's to hoping you're right.
MagicBoltzRays::At least we didn't get Bynum.
Buzzed Killington::Philly has a chance to beat the Heat if they still have Iggy and Harkless to defend Lebron and Vuc down low destroying them like he has done all year.. I'd want to hurt the GM badly if I were a 6ers fan.
TCluvcarpanthers::They wouldn't play Vuc or Harkless though.
Buzzed Killington::It could be worse for both of our franchises..We could have had a nice,young up and coming team with plenty of cap space and then traded Iggy,Vucevic,Harkless and multiple first round picks for Bynum,JRich and no more cap space..Now that is brutal..The future looks pretty bleak in Philly right now.
TCluvcarpanthers::They have Jrue Holiday, Thad Young, and cap space.
Buzzed Killington::BRUTAL TRADE for Philly. lol
NHLFANZ96::$@%!..in Ricky Ricardo Heat coach....sit down!!!
StompYourFace25::I'm off for the night. Maybe a good season before we meet again will be enough time for those moronic Magic fans to think of something to say.
riffralph16::If you had to trade harkless or harris who would it be
riffralph16::1 of them might be replaced by parker or wiggins
MagicBoltzRays::Wiggins would play SG.
MagicBoltzRays::Harkless still has more upside IMO. tough decision either way.
Buzzed Killington::That's a tough one.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Neither.
9edr0::oh Miami is so gonna loose
9edr0::hmm Nelson and a 1st round pick for Greivis Vasquez
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Child please.
9edr0::he is 6'6 also
9edr0::Vasquez is good averages 14ppg 9ast and 4.5reb
9edr0::Diop is best Center ever
9edr0::Top 10 SF's in NBA  1-LeBron James 2-Kevin Durant  3-Carmelo Anthony  4-Paul George  5-Paul Pierce  6-Luol Deng  7--Rudy Gay 8-Josh Smith 9-Nicolas Batum  10-Danilo Galliinari
TCluvcarpanthers::1. Lebron James  2. Kevin Durant   3. Carmelo Anthony  4. Paul George  5. Luol Deng 6. Paul Pierce  7. Rudy Gay  8. Nic Batum  9. Andrei Kirilenko  10. Danny Granger
Buzzed Killington::StompYourFace25 And, of course they would come to a rebuilding team if there WAS GOING TO BE 3 SUPERSTARS THERE. Pretty much what the Heat did, they were barely a playoff team. Got the 2nd pick in 2008. You are so dumb === The f*ck are you even talking about? You got downs or something? I'm losing brain cells just reading your worthless drivel.
StompYourFace25::"2 fans like this."  AKA Nupe and Buzzed Killington
StompYourFace25::ella es estupido  entenda?  si.  muy bien.
StompYourFace25::I said "Because every superstar wants to go to a rebuilding team"  You replied with the idiotic "Ever heard of Hill, McGrady, and Duncan?"  No $@%! they would go to a rebuilding team, if each one had 2 stars next to them.  That's exactly what the Heat did. But you won't see Lebron go to Charlotte for example with nobody else with him.   And if you are really losing brain cells, you might want to check that out. :P
TCluvcarpanthers::Tobias Harris, Andrew Nicholson, and a future protected 1st for Eric Bledsoe.  Yes or no?   That way the Magic can use their 1st round pick on the BPA not just their biggest need.
Buzzed Killington::Hell no..LOL Stop trying to make us worse you grimy Cat fan!
TCluvcarpanthers::You're unbelievable.
Buzzed Killington::Take out Harris too.
Buzzed Killington::I'm pretty sure they can sign him straight up in 2014 anyway..Why trade for him and hurt your chances of landing Wiggins in 2014? I see what you're trying to do!
TCluvcarpanthers::Ok, take out 1st round pick then.
Buzzed Killington::Not for all that.
TCluvcarpanthers::You don't like Bledsoe?
9edr0::no
Buzzed Killington::Stompyourface? Just because your team can't draft to save their lives doesn't mean ours can't..No f*ck off.
StompYourFace25::oh yeah I'm about to pull a Nupe on you  U MADE BR0000?????
StompYourFace25::Were did I say that l0l
StompYourFace25::Where*
Buzzed Killington::Come on Heat!!!!!!!!!!
TCluvcarpanthers::Bledsoe McLemore Harkless ??? Vuc
StompYourFace25::??? = Diop
Buzzed Killington::Magic ain't taking McLemore I can guarantee you that..It's Noel or Smart.
MagicBoltzRays::Harris
TCluvcarpanthers::Sixth man would be best for him IMO.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Bledsoe will be a free-agent right? I like Bledsoe. I think he's gona be a star  If anything a great defender.   Maybe Henny will go after him this summer.
Buzzed Killington::Heat going down
Buzzed Killington::Shame..I wanted them to beat the Lakers streak..
Buzzed Killington::StompYourFace25 Tim Duncan? Is this the Duncan I am perceiving it as? === Yes...Orlando was EXTREMELY close to signing Duncan.McGrady and Hill that summer.And I mean very close..Which would have changed the landscape of the NBA for a decade..We were technically the first team to try the sign 3 max players in one Summer thing..Worked out a little better for the Heat.
StompYourFace25::And, of course they would come to a rebuilding team if there WAS GOING TO BE 3 SUPERSTARS THERE. Pretty much what the Heat did, they were barely a playoff team. Got the 2nd pick in 2008. You are so dumb
StompYourFace25::Too bad he didn't come, so you can't use that as an example. And Hill and McGrady weren't max players... well paid but no way max.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::I was about to explain it but these are idiots.
StompYourFace25::"I was about to explain it but these are idiots"  YUP we are idiots. The irony
Budd1087::Thanks derpy
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Good one.......
Budd1087::Then you must be full blown re.tarded
TCluvcarpanthers::Top 20 Healthy Point Guards 1. Chris Paul   2. Tony Parker 3. Russell Westbrook 4. Jrue Holiday  5. Deron Williams  6. Steph Curry  7. John Wall 8. Ty Lawson 9. Brandon Jennings  10. Kemba Walker   11. Damian Lillard  12. Kyle Lowry 13. Mike Conley  14. George Hill 15. Goran Dragic 16. Jarrett Jack  17. Steve Nash 18. Eric Bledsoe  19. Raymond Felton 20. Jose Calderon  Any objections?
StompYourFace25::I would take Jameer Nelson over Dragic, Lowry, or Hill   gasp I  actually said that
theprodctz::Holiday's ranked a bit too high, no?
StompYourFace25::no
TCluvcarpanthers::Like 4 Top 10 point guards are hurt.
9edr0::hmm looks good to me
MagicBoltzRays::Bledsoe? no
9edr0::if he would start he would average about 15ppg 5ast and 5reb
TCluvcarpanthers::Anyone better than him?
9edr0::small markets succeed by drafting well....San Antonio and OKC draft excellent thus they are elite teams
StompYourFace25::yeah and we got our boy Cho from OKC about to work his magic
9edr0::Manu and Tony were both late picks
Buzzed Killington::Ohhh yes get Rondo in 2015 with that cap space to go with Wiggins,Harkless,Harris,Noel and Vuc!  One can dream...
JvrZulu::Can't build around a fake tough guy in Rondo Who gets I trouble and is hurt a lot
Buzzed Killington::We'd be building around Wiggins.Noel and Vuc..Rondo would be a complimentary piece.
Budd1087::Still sounds scrubbish
StompYourFace25::Bobcats will get McLemore/Noel, Wiggins/Parker, and we still have Detroit's pick and Portland's pick. Don't worry.
Budd1087::Sounds better than anything the Bobcats have. I hate this team so much.
StompYourFace25::"Future projections" mhm and Diop was supposed to be the next Hakeem Olajuwon/ Shaq
Buzzed Killington::Haa that's a championship caliber team based off of future projections of what each player will become.
Buzzed Killington::theprodctz He's gotta declare for the draft first. Not a 100% certainty he will ==== Uh yeah he's going pro no doubt..He's a guaranteed top 3 pick right now...If he comes back he may not even be top 5 next year..Makes absolutely no sense for him to stay. NONE.
9edr0::and with that recruiting class they have no way he stays he wont play enough
9edr0::Miami is so gonna loose
tryingtogetcolor::yes!
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::If Orlando doesn't get Wiggins &amp; drafts a dud this summer.  They still have cap space to sign two superstar free-agents 2013/2014/2015
riffralph16::Im pretty sure tracy mcgrady was more then just "solid" he was one of the best scorers back then
theprodctz::Last time we did that, we ended up with T-Mac and Grant Hill
Buzzed Killington::TMac was a superstar for sure in his Orlando days.
theprodctz::If Hill could've stayed healthy, and if we could've actually built a team around afterwards, which speaks even more to the risk behind that strategy
Budd1087::That would of been a nice tandem if Grant could of stayed healthy.
9edr0::both were solid but not superstars
StompYourFace25::Yes because every superstar wants to come to a rebuilding team
StompYourFace25::Tim Duncan? Is this the Duncan I am perceiving it as?
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Ever heard of McGrady, Hill &amp; Duncan?
Budd1087::Yeah pick up Gilbert Arenas!
Buzzed Killington::Would rather draft our own superstars and fill in the spaces with FA.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::I agree. Still a nice option. Rondo &amp; Love would be worth it.   Long shot though.
Buzzed Killington::Had we based our decision to draft Dwight back in 2004 off of his offensive skill set we would have never taken him.You draft off of potential..And no one in this draft has more potential to be great than Noel..That's just the fact of the situation.
9edr0::this year literally like 5 guys could go #1
StompYourFace25::It's official..... Nupe is the stupidest troll out there
Budd1087::He's got my vote.
StompYourFace25::U MAID BR0???!
9edr0::i guess he is a maid
JvrZulu::Build around Walker
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::*chuckles*
JvrZulu::Like when I saw u were a Eagles fan?
Buzzed Killington::As far as Noel goes...I think you absolutely take him #1..Most big men don't have a great offensive game at 18 years old...I know Dwight sure as hell didn't ...What we do know is Noel is a long,athletic big man who can dominate a game with his defense alone..Those guys are rare..Obvious choice IMO.
theprodctz::He's gotta declare for the draft first. Not a 100% certainty he will
StompYourFace25::agreed
Budd1087::He's the next Bismack Biyombo
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::I agree.
StompYourFace25::that leg man.. I'm not trusting it
9edr0::he is just 18 that will heal much better  than it would on a 25 or 30yr old
Buzzed Killington::Dude knee injuries arn't as bad as they used to be..
StompYourFace25::Watch Wiggins be the next Kwamay Brown
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Oh well. Worth a shot.  You got another idea to be great?
StompYourFace25::You make me crack up. I bet when we get him you will be begging this is true
Buzzed Killington::It's sad us Cat/Magic fans don't even care who we draft this year as long is it isn't someone good enough to f*ck us out of drafting Wiggins next year. lol
TCluvcarpanthers::The funny thing is that whole draft class is so deep. Even if none of us get Wiggins, we'll get great players.
9edr0::that is the goal lol
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::*Sighs* I said draft Noel to tank for Wiggins.   Read. Learn how to read........
JvrZulu::Drats
StompYourFace25::No $@%!. I'm not blind. Doesn't change anything you said though. You contradicted yourself
theprodctz::We can draft someone like McLemore and still have a chance at Wiggins
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::I said OR. McLemore seems like a "Henny" guy. both sides of the ball &amp; lengthy.  Or draft Noel to tank next year.
Budd1087::Learn to spell.
Budd1087::WHY ARE YOU YELLING
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Good one.....  Can you go away now? Thanks!  Bye!
theprodctz::Can't wait til we get Andrew Wiggins in 2014
StompYourFace25::me too fellow bobcats fan
tryingtogetcolor::red?
Buzzed Killington::Stern will make it happen.
MagicBoltzRays::we really should draft smart. I don't want anyone with "high injury risks"
TCluvcarpanthers::18 year olds can recover from ACL injuries and come back stronger.
9edr0::yea his body is still growing he should recover relatively quickly
Budd1087::Yeah draft Noel that's a safe pick!
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::I think Henny will draft Noel to tank or McLemore.  He doesn't seem to gamble &amp; he likes players that can play offense &amp; defense.
theprodctz::Why would we make a (presumably) top-3 pick just to tank?
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::I SAID TO TANK YOU IDIOTS! CAN YOU READ!&gt;|!?!?!?!?
StompYourFace25::If he doesn't seem to gamble, he wouldn't get Noel. And Noel can't play offense. Do you even know basketball?
theprodctz::Noel just did his knee, and has no offensive game. Can't see Henny going that route
TCluvcarpanthers::"But, personally, the best way to identify [1-on-1 stoppers] is to use Synergy Sports’ isolation defenders. Some of the more household names are Andre Iguodala (5th in iso, 0.45 points per possession (PPP)), Tony Allen (16th in iso, 0.54 PPP), Lebron James (67th in iso, 0.7 PPP), Luol Deng (152nd in iso, 0.87). MKG?? He ranks 2nd allowing just 0.45 PPP. Yes, S-E-C-O-N-D. Ahead of well known defenders named above. He’s quick, he’s long and he’s smart. Add all that up and what you get is a First Team All Defense candidate in a year or two."
TheMagicFanGuy::Someone ELSE's opinion on a statistic proves nothing. If you watched Harkless cover Durant, Lebron, Kobe, and others this season you'd know he has a higher ceiling.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::This won't win any games.........  Clearly, Lol!
TCluvcarpanthers::It proves he is a better defender than Harkless.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::So THIS makes Harkless better than MKG?
TCluvcarpanthers::Clearly his team is lacking in talent.
StompYourFace25::now you have nothing to say since he just made you eat your words saying Harkless is better than MKG. lol
Buzzed Killington::Harkless  reminds of TMac..Maybe not as good a shooter or handles  but about equal in terms of athleticism and seems to be a much better defender than Tracy was.
TCluvcarpanthers::That's a lofty comparison. Let him have a couple good seasons before starting that hype train.
Buzzed Killington::Of course I'm comparing Moe to a teenage TMac and not prime TMAC..I'm simply saying Harkless has that type of potential.
TCluvcarpanthers::Ahh, I see now.
StompYourFace25::Not even close.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Uh oh, we have a "self-liker" in here people.  Ew.
Budd1087::not really
Budd1087::^^^^G@Y
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::^^^^^Guilty.
