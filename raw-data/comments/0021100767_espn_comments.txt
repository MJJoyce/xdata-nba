Kobelies247::LOL, how many times did you have to edit that before it spelled what you wanted? LOL  And you call me a DB?

Kobelies247::This is true, but the organization has lied time and time again to its fans...I for one am done with it!  You can  keep living this pathetic dream that will NEVER see the light of day :)
58rhodes::no not at all--The Blazers got rid of McMillan and are playing decent ball
Kobelies247::Can you say two faced? haha
7 is a Legend::This is a legit question; What team were U obvious Banwagoneers rootn for b4 this season? Because we all know that the Lakers were the only LA team with actual fans. Ha!
Gang_Green02::Wesley Matthews CLEARLY got hit on the arm. His runner attempt at the end went about 3 feet left of the basket!!!!!! He doesn't miss that bad unless he got HIT. And Blake Griffin is such a little $@%!$; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrNYIBw3fw
airwhitey003::It was clear as day that Matthews got hit on the arm. Also it seems as if NBA referees believe that chris paul can do no wrong with the ball in his hands, because he double dribbled two times in this game without calls. The Clippers, as basketball players are the most fitting team for the town of Los Angeles, because they are the best actors in the league, specifically Blake Griffin and Chris Paul. They are a sad team to watch, so much so that James Naismith is rolling in his grave watching this flop-fest-garbage-ball that L.A. chooses to employ. Its not how basketball is meant to be played.This is the second game this season, in which a W was earned by the Blazers and subsequently stolen from them by the referees. But they keep pushing and playing hard, and us true Blazers fans will continue to watch and cheer despite an inevitable rough-and-tumble season. While you Clippers fans, if in our situation, would've gone back to rooting for the Lakers at this point. Go Blazers!
Gang_Green02::sampecker, and you did not dispute that Griffin is a $@%!$ because it is undeniable
sambecker1::nope, just a hand in his face. it's okay that your team sucks.
7 is a Legend::Ur obviously $@%! eyed and cant tell a slap on the arm to a d!ck in the butt... The Clippers have 2 all-stars to none, 4th seed in the West vs the 12th...and only won by 1...
jackster013::quit b!itching blazer fans
13alexrodriguez3::Blazers did well despite being at a 5 on 8 disadvantage.
Randis38::This jack $@% that wrote this didn't watch the game at all..The only reason the Clipps won is because the reffs will not give end of the game calls to the Blazers against Super star players..Wesley was clobbered by an obviously shooting foul to any reff in any game at any level the thing about the NBA is they don't have to make calls against superstars so they don't(no no no its not a conspiracy but it is a thing the reffs getaway with constantly..like the game against the thunder when LaMarcus cleanly blocked Durants last minute shot  the reffs call goal tending the game ends and Portland loses then after the game the reffs and league  say Oh sorry Portland we got that one wrong too bad you still lose..same thing happened last night..It's crap and this league it become crap..and seriously could the clips flop more or could Chris Paul travel and not get called  more?
13alexrodriguez3::Blake flops against a senior citizen (Kurt Thomas) who is weaker than him. Really refs, that makes sense to you to call a foul?
Kobe_in_my_team::Lebrons taking note
CPlame41::So, is this game the new highlight of Chris Paul's career? I can't really think of anything else he's accomplished?
johndoe106::Ha bro he was on the Hornets his whole career what do you expect?
CPlame41::Wait! He did have that cute little run to the second round 5 years ago....what a stud...
BarrelRider04::Great to see the Clips back to getting some wins, but last night again exposes just how atrocious there defense is. They play good defense for maybe 2-5 minute stretches at best. And then the floodgates open and it's "Ole...ole, ole, ole...ole.....ole!" All you have to do against the Clips is set a high pick and it causes complete chaos and they can't rotate/recover.
58rhodes::Blazers looked pretty good last night
phunky58::I swear the coaches in this league may know their x's and o's    but some of them have serious substitution problems and putting the wrong people on the floor.   i wish i could be in charge of just that for someone.     i mean how long has hickson been sitting around on the bench.    thhen we have minnesota puttin beasely on the bench for long stretches so he never gets into the flow of the game.   the guy can go off for 30 plus pts and 10 + rebounds at any moment he has way too much talent.   then we have oj mayo comin off the bench in memphis.  the list goes on and on.   i swear these coaches are trying to lose games.   damn feels good to get that out
big_east27::truth!
gobiaskoffi::22-15
Kee7676::another CP3 Dagger...lol...Your 2012 MVP!!! ...nuff said
undiscoveredgreatness::hahahah this logical1 fan is a complete idiot crying about the trailblazers who are terrible and the blazers are playing for a higher draft pick naaa not really there records like only 4 or sum games under 500 so when they get a draft pick from that the best pick theyll get is like 10 overall at best the blazers just straight blow off game for the clips tho
Logicalfan1::snuff said maybe, sniffing it much? I don't even think hes in the running. But hey if you want to get on your knees for him go right ahead.
Logicalfan1::Blazer fans, NO NEED TO BE UPSET. We won fair and square. The refs had to cheat to give the game to the Clippers. And Aldridge didn't even play! Besides remember, we aren't playing for this season. The more losses we get the better draft position we get. TWICE OVER! So who cares honestly.  You've got to love the heart that this team plays with, something the Clippers will never have. In a year, two tops. This will be a very scary team. So don't be to upset that yet again the NBA has thrown a game in favor of a Los Angeles based team. Big surprise....They've been doing it for over a Decade.
johndoe106::I feel like I heard this from Blazers fans a few years ago too. You guys were going to be sooo good when Brandon Roy, and Lamarcus Aldridge, and Greg Oden all get a little older... so forgive me for not buying into your "this will be a very scary team" prediction. Enjoy the loss.
BarrelRider04::Wow, you sound like a butt hurt little girl.
drmcfunk::THERE IS NO FLOPPING IN BASKETBALL THERE IS ONLY DRAWING A FOUL AND DOING IT PROPERLY IS A SKILL. IF YOU MESS IT UP YOU TAKE YOURSELF OUT OF THE PLAY. KEEP ON HATING PEOPLE WE ARE 1 GAME OUT OF 3RD IN THE WEST AND PLAYING HORRIBLY

SteveNashInPDX::LET ME BE CLEAR.  GRIFFIN SHOVED MATHEWS WITH HIS LEFT HAND PUSHING HIM TO THE GROUND.  THE BLAZERS GOT JOBBED.  MEOW!!!
THEALEX310::cry about it bro
CBass1317::yeah bro
yoepithet::cp3 doing his thing and telling the nation that he's the best pg in the league!
CBass1317::I'll take some Westbrook this season.  Give me the two way player.
BlackmambaStrikeFast24::Floppers won haha
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::Cp3 is the best flopper
yoepithet::ummm, no. learn your basketball.
SteveNashInPDX::HOW CAN HE BE THE BEST PG IN THE LEAGUE WHEN D-WILL DOMINATES HIM EACH AND EVERY TIME THEY PLAY HEAD TO HEAD???  MEOW!!!
yoepithet::this is such a stupid statement. so by this logic, carmelo is the best SF since he dominates against lebron right? use your head bud.
iberrypa::tough no call, really how bout blatant missed call at the end. griffin smacked mathews right on the elbow
Logicalfan1::There were many bad calls that added up to about 10-12 points in favor of the Clippers. So ya the Blazers really did win the game. Yet again another blown goaltending call. Do the refs even know how that rule works? But like my post above says, we laugh it off because the jokes on you. The clippers are going to get bounced in the first round and we get a lottery pick. And the Blazers are the better team! hahaha
_slickSixtySix_::ya ok like the blazers had a chance anyway what a joke team
Lebron_is_the_greatest::How many times did chris paul flop in this one?
-KING-ME-::I'm out gn all
