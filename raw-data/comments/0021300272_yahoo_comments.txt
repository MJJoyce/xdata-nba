Je Sui::Where is OJ mayo?
Patrick::Why aren't they playing Brandon Knight?
John::Don't look now, but we're all alone in 2nd place! Go Pistons!
DCopp::Monroe/Drummond=twin towers.  Awesome.  Jennings dropping 11 dimes is nice too!
PKM::Did the Pistons have a long night in South Beach?
doomshades::42 pts 36 rebs. The Pistons' twin towers are quite scary, and they're just 23 and 20 years old.
AlD::Thanks for the win refs, we'll take it. It almost make sup for the win you gave OKC a couple weeks ago. 42 trips to the line. Thanks from a Piston fan.
