Shabazz54::Got to say to all the Michigan Homers, cannot abide drafting Trey Burke: here is why, he's not going to be able to rush the basket at 6'0 and throw up prayer hook shots against NBA size, he took the game over himself in the Final and the big 10 championship game  totally lost any advantage Hardaway or McGary or the rest of his team could of had. That's why draftexpress and nbadraft question his court vision, specially in the half court
UConnBigO::I don't think Shabazz will be that great of a pro, I hope he is, but I don't see it.  He didn't declare did he?
retiredat23::Detroit would/should never draft Burke. We already have 3 point guards, two of which will probably be gone after this season (Calderon, Bynum). But Burke isn't a back-up. He'll be the starting PG for a bad team next year, and I'd like to see him in Orlando - I think he'd be great there. Detroit needs athleticism at the SG and SF positions - Singler is a backup SF. If McLemore and/or Oladipo are available, we should look strongly at them. Shabazz is a chucker, but he's got a ton of talent, I'm sure we'll scout him hard as well.
Tdavis2304::We have no SF or SG once draft start and free agency starts pistons should be stright.. Drafting a SG like Burke and get SF like C.J Leslie than add maybe mayo and a PF like JJ hickson or whoever idk.. Next trade stuckey and maybe JJ for a starting SF..JD need to go too
retiredat23::Hahaha "SG like Burke" what are you smoking? Burke is a PG, and we already have 3 of those!!! Leslie could be good, but we're getting a top 10 pick, so Oladipo or McLemore are probably better options for us at the SG position.
jaer04::god cleveland and ohio is pathetic
izzo is mr march::Moves I would love to see happen with the Pistons:  (1) Get rid of Joe Dumars and bring in John Hammond to un the show.  (2) Get rid of Franks and hire Bill Laimbeer.  (3) Draft Trey Burke with our lottery pick.  (4) Trade Knight and Stuckey and get a small forward and a big guard in return.  (5) Build the team around Drummond Burke and Monroe.   How confident are we about Trey Burke running the point?  Why don't we just draft a true first round SF?
retiredat23::David Kahn would be a better GM than you, and NBA intellectuals know what kind of a diss that is!
Spencer-Jones::Andre Drummond &gt; Kyrie Irving
retiredat23::Piston fan here and ......no. Not even close.
PistonFanSinceCobo::I really like Andre Drummond, but he could be a real beast if he was a 90% FT shooter.  Jonas V in Toronto is a very good FT shooter and this will only help him become an All Star.  Ditto for Andre Drummond, who if he improves this important facet of the game, will be an All Star too.
djhugh313::2 different athletes that's a stupid comparison
sponsoredbytwinkie::can't figure out why Waiters is playing.. what's the team benefit at this point of the season?
mango_33::Cavs can't finish a game to save their collective lives...
detroit tigers for the win::I WANT BURKE
sports guy12::"The tank job worked... uhh I mean we lost"- Cavaliers Management
Austin21690::saddest stat as a cavs fan:  of the other teams in the league when up 20+ points in the fourth quarter, they win 97% of the time.   the cavs? TWENTY FOUR.
4480William::Moves I would love to see happen with the Pistons: (1) Get rid of Joe Dumars and bring in John Hammond to un the show. (2) Get rid of Franks and hire Bill Laimbeer. (3) Draft Trey Burke with our lottery pick. (4) Trade Knight and Stuckey and get a small forward and a big guard in return. (5) Build the team around Drummond Burke and Monroe.
detroit tigers for the win::#2, #3 and #5 are good. #4 is iffy. #1 is a hell no
denn19641::I strongly agree on the 3rd one. Pistons won their championship through the Palace Guards. But whom do we pair with him at SG. Isiah have Joe, Chauncey have RIP, I don't see BK7 to complement but a 6th Man.
4480William::The NBA right now is about getting a point guard to run the show and be your leader.  The past few years the Pistons have shored their big guys with Drummond and Monroe. Now, if they draft Trey Burke, he and Kim English could form a solid young backcourt in the Central Division.  Get rid of Knight and Stuckey and built with Burke and English.
rp40291::This is the biggest misconception about the NBA. There are tons of elite PG's in the NBA these days. How many of them have championships as the main guy? You could MAYBE argue Rondo and Parker. Paul, Williams, Rose, Westbrook all have 0 combined. Irving is the best young PG in the game and his team sucks. You need multiple great players and many good players regardless of position.
M-V the MVP::get rid of stuckey not knight. We need knight....and burke will be a good option for now because there is no clear great SF prospect right now.
Jumeax::Should only consider burke of Potter and Olidip are already off the board, and ic Mclemore or Smart are still on the board, then of course should consider them but Burke should be plan B
Jumeax::Who wants Stuckey and Knight together? two combo guards
4480William::Get rid of Knight too!  Knight and Stuckey can be packages to get a good small forward who can stretch he floor.
4480William::The Pistons have always been at their best when a guard is the leader. Dave Bing, Isiah Thomas and later Chauncey Billups. Right now they have no leader on the court. DRAFT Trey Burke, put the ball in his hands and grow with him, Drummond, Monroe, English and Singler.  Stuckey has had 6 years to become a leader and it just ain't gonna happen. Brandon Knight is not the answer running the team or shooting the ball.
Jumeax::Heres the thing  Knight looked great in college, did well in the tournament  trey burke is a 'maybe'/probably better than Knight, and thats after an extra season in college
zachzach1010::Hey Cavs fans......... Explain to me why you believe your team will be better than the Pistons in 2-3 years.
jaer04::idk maybe tyler zeller
kristy41177::Who plays in what, 50 games a season? lol @ that.  He'll leave Cleveland as soon as he can.  No one likes to play in the mistake by the lake.
ThunderFresh::i hope kyrie becomes the king of the east IN CLEVELAND, just so you can feel like the $@% you look like
Steel_Smack::Kyrie Irving.
4480William::I would love to see a young core group of Detroit Pistons built around Andre Drummond, Greg Monroe, Trey Burke, Kyle Singler  and Kim English. Get rid of Stuckey and Knight, sign a couple of free agents and trade for a star.  Put the ball in Burke's hands and built the tam around him and Drummond.
The Ghost of Vernon Davis::Cleveland making a serious run for that 3rd pick.
joest2003::Love watching Drummond play cant wait to see what he grows into in Detroit
JohnsonnnL::People need to stop calling for Scott's job, and just trust that upper management knows what they are doing.
orange_63::Cavs must be on a 5 YEAR PLAN.................
Shabazz54::Scott should be promoted :) To head of concessions!
izzo is mr march::What do you guys think about SF Shabazz guy from ucla?   Is he a true Small Forward?  Bleacherreport has him a lottery pick
detroit tigers for the win::he's also a vag
4480William::NBA bust.
Shabazz54::Has a weird shot mechanic that could easily be disrupted by nba defenders, that I've read could make a huge bust, combine that with the fact he is the definition of a one dimensional player and he could make the team that takes him look very foolish.  Also 6'6 SF isn't ideal
TigerMichLion111::SG/SF  BUT he's a PURE SCORER which is why I love him but he lacks defense
Shabazz54::Enjoyed this game:  Mostly due to the fact that the hack a dre strategy caused my dad to swear more at a tv than I’ve ever heard before. He will give Byron Scott the bird if he ever meets him in person.
FadeBackShootAirBall4::starting drummond and monroe together=trouble, drummond just needs to learn how to make half his ft's he doesn't have to be a good or even average ft shooter he just needs to be manageable
M-V the MVP::^double trouble he means. Those two heights are lethal
Philip3664::Good trouble right?
FadeBackShootAirBall4::lol yeah good trouble
Shabazz54::Nope Double Trouble! Stevie Ray Vaughn Guitar solo engage!
M-V the MVP::Detroit can become good in 3 years. They need to keep Jonas, Andre, Monroe and knight. We need to get rid of the big paid salary  overrated players and then look towards the future. We do lose a draft pick this year, but next year's draft looks very strong. We can get a player like Jabari Parker or Andrew Wiggin, a true SF. I love Stuckey but he is not the future of the pistons. Also, we need to get rid of charlie V, Maggette, and Stuckey. We need to get a better SG than Sngler.
M-V the MVP::jonas will eventually go as a bench player, but as of now, singler is not doing a good job.  His size at SG should make him lethal
TigerMichLion111::Jonas?  He's average at best...singler is better
Brothers1759::Cacs could've had Irving-Drummond duo for a decade.....they better hope Waiters can ball.  That was a mistake.  You can always get a 2-guard....guys like Drummond only come around so often.
HunterF4444::Pretty sure we have already seen that Waiters can ball...
scottsvb1::If Cleveland gets a Defensive Minded Coach who can teach them young kids Defense and the Cavs can pick up a Top 10 player... then the Cavs will be a good team.  But without a Coach that can teach them Kids Defense and No Vet player that is a threat.. then Cleveland will always be bad.  Iriving will continue to improve offensively...so will Thompson ....Waiters? Who knows.. but Iriving hasn't learned Defense along with no one on the team.  Fire Scott...get a Coach that can Teach Defense...and pick up 1 good player.. and Cavs will be a above .500 team next year.
scottsvb1::Thanks...how much do you want to pay me :)
HunterF4444::Dude why don't we just make you GM? You seem to know everything.
scottsvb1::If Cleveland does get a good defensive coach and say with LBJ on their team again..they would win 55-60 games.. but yeah...keep dreaming.
JohnsonnnL::who do you suggest they hire?
SMANGANG::Irving overrated? can't even lead his team to 30 wins...
JohnsonnnL::Neither did Durant, and Westbrook their first two seasons.
scottsvb1::He hasn't learned Defense yet..  when he does, he will be a great player..but right now, he's like a 2nd year rookie
FadeBackShootAirBall4::overrated? hmm..nah he's just injury prone sometimes he tries to do to much on his own instead of using his teammates.
Shabazz54::Sounds like Trey Burke
SMANGANG::you're right.. thats what i've been seeing out of him.. trying to score more than playing the all around game...
detroitsports1994::Pistons need Oladipo!
4480William::Please!  Indiana turns out NOTHING but NBA scrubs. Other than Isiah Thomas 32 years ago, all I've seen from IU are overrated players.
M-V the MVP::I say we trade this pick for the 2014 draft. There are better players in that draft.
4480William::Don't be foolish!  You need a quarterback and you have one right in your backyard named Trey Burke. Burke could be part of a cornerstone with Monroe, Singler, Drummond and English.  Trey Burke has Isiah Thomas like qualities. (1) Tough (2) Leader (3) Big heart (4) Charismatic (5) Outstanding ball skills (6) Makes big time plays.  PLUS he will put local fans in the seats with his following just like Isiah did in his days.
TigerMichLion111::Burke or Porter or Shabazz...don't need another SG...
Jumeax::Not Shabaz!  Oladipo or Poerter would be good/great  It all depends what pick we get, a higher or lower pick than expected and it could mean the best player on the board trumps need  Just throwing it out there if the lottery balls screw us out of Porter/Oladipo  Dario Saric as a 6'10" small point forward, Just imagining a shades of Bynum, Gasol, Odom with a Drummond, Monroe,  Saric
detroitsports1994::you cant go wrong with those guys either
FadeBackShootAirBall4::whatever the pistons do don't draft cody zeller or tim hardaway jr
TigerMichLion111::FadeBackShootAirBall4 - whatever the pistons do don't draft cody zeller or tim hardaway jr  THJ would be a GREAT 2nd round pick what r u talkinh about?
Shabazz54::you wouldn't take a flyer on hardaway in the 2nd?
TigerMichLion111::I would take Burke as our starting PG over anyone we have right now any day
FadeBackShootAirBall4::I must admit I am a Michigan hater lol..but that's not why I dislike hardaway jr I just think he's just way to over hyped I've watched him play and he doesn't jump out at me he looks average at best..and I'm not hating on burke I said he would be good but he can't be you're starter.
TigerMichLion111::You must be a MICHIGAN hater because Burke and Hardaway were two of the best guards in the country this year
FadeBackShootAirBall4::noo noo noo..it would be a waste of a draft pick, he doesn't look good to me at all..I never understood the hype about him.
Philip3664::Big NO to Cody Zeller
Effectful::Glad to see Kyrie is playing decent again.
izzo is mr march::Do you think Trey Burke is the pistons guy to draft?  I personally think we need to draft a Small forward.
M-V the MVP::So we can still keep our lottery pick this year, right?
M-V the MVP::I thought we gave away our draftpick to the bobcats in that Ben Gordon trade....
TigerMichLion111::No it is lottery protected
Brent-Blair::Wgat about Jose?
Philip3664::Burke could come off the bench for Jose
Philip3664::If we could get Iggy that would help solve that
Philip3664::Yeah. I think he would be a better option than Knight IMO
TigerMichLion111::If we get Iggy then do you think Burke is the righ choice?
TigerMichLion111::YES, but just beause they're isn't a star SF in this draft!
scottsvb1::Good thing cleveland blew another game by purposly losing. If you give up 37 pts to anyone in the 4th quarter.. you know you don't care
Brothers1759::Good thing Chris Grant passed on Andre Drummond to take Waiters....
scottsvb1::He's frustrated cause he knows his team sucks and can't handle being a leader with a crappy coach.  Scott needs to be fired cause he don't know how to teach them Kids Defense!  Cavs need a top 5 player but no top 5 player wants to go to cleveland.. that's part of the reason LBJ left.  Wade could of went to cleveland..along with Bosh...but Miami or Cleveland...hmmm  take Miami.
Shabazz54::Irving looked pretty frustrated for someone who doesn't care
Effectful::You have to prefect the tank.
FadeBackShootAirBall4::ever considered that they're just that bad
Jumeax::9/17 FT! WOOO I can only hope Drummond has graduated From Ben Wllace Free Throws  to Dwight howard/Shaq level Free Throw proficieny 50% Baby!
FadeBackShootAirBall4::detroit doesn't need anymore pg's they already have enough...brandon knight, rodney stucky..will bynum, calderon..pg isn't the problem..this team has major potential like I stated before drummond and monroe will be a problem for any team next season.
Jumeax::knight still has potential at least on the defensive end  Stucky ... tried that..... stick a fork in him... NEXT
FadeBackShootAirBall4::agree with stucky, he's to inconsistent..he has flashes of greatness but not enough.
TigerMichLion111::DISAGREE 100%  BK7 ISN'T a PG, stuckey will prolly be traded, let Calderon go not good enough IMO and all Will is is a backup  Burke will be a top 10 PG in the NBA and dominated college Bball this year, he's the guy I want
Shabazz54::Dude he's not going to be able to rush the basket at 6'0 and throw up prayer hook shots against NBA size, he took the game over himself totally lost any advantage hardaway could of had.  That's why draftexpress and nbadraft question his court vision, specially in the half court.
TigerMichLion111::Sorry have to disagree...Burke is better than any guard we have....
FadeBackShootAirBall4::he is a pg he's just been moved to sg because the pistons have to many guards as is..and bruke will not be a great starter he'll be a good back up through
Shabazz54::I'd like to see them keep calderon for a two or three year deal.  Let knight be the 6th man.  I think he was rushed into starting pg to quickly same with rodney.  Figure knight is a younger version of Rodney so he's got more wear by the time calderon leaves he could be an overall pg.
FadeBackShootAirBall4::agreed, I think if detroit offers the money calderon is willing to come back...and I disagree about brandon knight, I think the coach was right to start him at pg that's the only way he's going to grow and become better.
TigerMichLion111::But if they suck for ONE more year then I wouldn't care much because next year is really the year to tank!! The guy I want on the Pistons the most is unrealistic but I would live for the Pistins to be able to get jabari Parker in the draft next year if they don't sign a big FA!! Of course I am in awe of the talent and athleticism of Andrew Wiggins and think he could turn the Pistons into an instant contender but Pistons would have to get #1 overall pick next year
TigerMichLion111::Plus I would love Aaron Harrison as well as our starting SG if we get in the 4-8 pick range again, kid is a beast and can shoot better and is stronger than Knight....randle as well could be a solid 3/4
TheJTram::TigerMichLion111 - TheJTram - Andre Iguodala? Hello?  Is he a FA?  I can't Rememebr but yes he would be exactly what Pistons need but would then need a better shooting SG ------------------------------------------- http://nba.si.com/2013/03/31/andre-iguodala-free-agency-nuggets-opt-out-player-option/  He will be a FA this summer as he opts out of his contract depending on the Nuggets playoff success which probably wouldnt be more than the 2nd round due to Gallinari's injury and his value to the Nuggets
FadeBackShootAirBall4::wow@monroe and drummond...this is what they should've looked like at the start of the season..starting these two would be trouble for any team.
TigerMichLion111::Draft Burke...sign a bench scorer then give Smith a max contract and we could have:  Burke BK7 Josh smith Monroe  Drummond   Bench: Singler  English FA(JJ Reddick, millsap...) Kravtsov   TRADE STUCKEY for a draft pick or bench scorer
4480William::Get rid of Knight and play English with Burke. Knight is not the player we thought he was.
Constanza_George::Hell no, we don't want Smith. I'd rather draft Otto Porter than Burke, then sign OJ Mayo. Trade Stuckey AND Knight for a PG and/or draft picks. I'm really not a big fan of Knight.
M-V the MVP::the monroe drummond combo will be so deadly in two years. The amazing part is that monroe is just about to hit his peak and andre isn't even 20 yet!
The Account of Monte Cristo::Who is BK7?
TheJTram::Brandon Knight
MansGame5313::So we have an even smaller backcourt and a front court where 2 guys cancel each other out cause they play the same way
4480William::WE went to THREE STRAIGHT NBA Finals and won two titles with a small backcourt.  If you have skills, size won't matter. I recall our guards whipping big guards like Jordan, Magic, Cooper, Scott, DJ and Ainge. Do you recall that?
Shabazz54::Greg Monroe does not play the same as Drummond.  Greg plays under the basket with a variety of post moves.  Drummond is way more of a defensive presence and cleans up 2nd chance points cause he can get so far above the rim.  These two compliment each other with their differences not cancel each other out.
TigerMichLion111::A quick and good defensive backcourt as well I could care less about size for a PG...
TheJTram::Josh Smith doesnt really space out the floor much with his rainbow bricks when he should use his athleticism to attack the paint more
TheJTram::As good as Josh Smith is, he is not the answer to our prayers
Philip3664::Why Josh Smith though
TigerMichLion111::TheJTram - Andre Iguodala? Hello?  Is he a FA?  I can't Rememebr but yes he would be exactly what Pistons need but would then need a better shooting SG
TheJTram::Andre Iguodala? Hello?
TigerMichLion111::We NEED a 6-8 SF with athletic ability and who can score 15-20 points a game!!  It's a need in today's NBA to have a premier 3 man and please tell me where else Pistons are getting one lol...porter isn't that good on the offensive end
Philip3664::Damn Henson had 25 rebounds
TigerMichLion111::WTF really??
airicad::hack-a-shaq game plans have had a 0-2 success rate this year.  it makes you lose games AND look desperate.
The Account of Monte Cristo::0.157325438
Nash_Owns_LA::Everyone loves Hack-a-Shaq gameplans until they're the victim of it
Rcrown10::niiiice L by the Cavs keep on throwing games and moving up in the Lotto
straub42::For what though? Who are we targeting?  Lets stop using this as an excuse for losing stupid games. We are pretty much locked into the 4-5 spot. We dont need to move up anymore unless we are trading the pick
TheJTram::straub42 - Hes easily the next Shawn Bradley ------------------------------------ Eh....that's good and bad on both ways.... Shawn Bradley is a good shot blocker but....he was also the NBA's posterizing doll
straub42::Im kinda being sarcastic. Bradley was 7-6 and got dominated by smaller guys all day. Zeller shouldnt be playing 10 min let a lone starting, but when Varejao is out, theres not much choice. I dont see him averaging over 18 min a gm next year
Aaron.Rob::4 game swept? ouch 4 game sweep by the hand of the Pistons? double ouch
andrewplayer21::Bring back Mike Brown.  Oladipo 4th pick Deshaun Thomas 15th pick  Greg Oden Free Agent maybe?  Need a reliable 3pt shooter.
JohnsonnnL::Why would you want Mike Brown again?
bballgun2::i think this may be a little influenced by your osu fandom. lol Deshaun thomas at 15? wow
straub42::If we take Thomas at 15 ill kill myself. He will easily be there at 34 for our 2nd second rounder.  Id rather have Isaiah Austin or James McAdoo
TigerMichLion111::No big ten guys!  Lol and I wouldn't take Thomas that high....Marcus smart maybe if he's still available could be good for you guys although you have a SG
Shabazz54::You cannot hack Andre Drummond!
verfielderbrera::Never understood why magette never played this year.
TigerMichLion111::You know what I wondered the same thing....t lest tent lose the contract this year and free up 8 mil.  I thought maggette could've helped out the younger guys playing with them during actual games, oh well
airicad::piston fans, is singler your sf of the future?  just wondering...
Shabazz54::I don't think so.  2014 offseason he'll be replaced.
airicad::lol good
TheJTram::I don't think so. I appreciated him stepping up into the role but he doesnt seem to fit with us
TigerMichLion111::NO  at least I hope not...bench player
TigerMichLion111::DRE DRUMMOND!!  What a performance(besides the FTs lol)   How are pistons fans doing?  Haven't been here in awhile but it's the end of the yer and for the draft:  Burke, porter, Shabazz or oladipo?  Burke and Drummond would be fun
Shabazz54::He can defend 4 positions and his percentages seem to show he takes smart shots when necessary.  I figure his defense would translate into transition points with our young fast big men, so he wouldn't need to be a scoring load in the same way RIP was
JohnsonnnL::That's college hes probably not defending much nba sf and definitely not pf
Shabazz54::Burke would be fun.  But i'd like the pistons to get a little tougher defensively.  I'd say oladipo.
TigerMichLion111::I agree can't go wrong but only reason I don't like oladipo is because he's a SGA AND NOT SF...we don't need another one of those but oladipo could be a good overall guy
airicad::I'm excited.   Drummond, Vucevic, Davis... the center position will become relevant again in the next decade!
Shabazz54::Like his outside jump shot for sure, savy on alot of other things not a high ceiling but will have a great career.
straub42::Dont forget Tyler Zeller!!
TigerMichLion111::kc_fan01 - TigerMichLion111 - Sorry but no lol  for real. He gets bullied by physical players everytime. lol.  Just like Cody will....
straub42::Hes easily the nexy Shawn Bradley
kc_fan01::TigerMichLion111 - Sorry but no lol  for real. He gets bullied by physical players everytime. lol.
TigerMichLion111::Sorry but no lol
TheJTram::Davis is more of a PF though. He's drawn comparisons to Kevin Garnett
TheJTram::That too
airicad::big men in general
