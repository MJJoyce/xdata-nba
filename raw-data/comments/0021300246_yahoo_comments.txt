dave::Dragic reminds me of Kevin Johnson, with his ability to slash and score. As a Suns fan for 20 years we have always been blessed with great point guards, KJ, Kidd, Nash, even Marbury, and right now we have two of them. This team will be great with just one or two more pieces.
seth::Glad to see Jefferson has gained a step back into the game.
jammin400::Plumlee needs more consistent playing time.  They guy has been solid this year when he plays and the Suns don't have any other healthy centers right now that give his effort.
Lance::Big Marvin Williams is playing another solid game for Utah!
Anton::I always knew Trey Burke would be a superstar. I vote him for ROY. 20-6-3 with 4 threes and 1 TO. That is ultra impressive against Bledsoe, and only Trey's 2nd game.
gary::The Suns were out played, out hustled and out coached by the terrible Utah Jazz tonight. With Plumlee sitting on the bench the 2nd half,  they have no presence in the middle. This should have been a game that they won especially when playing at home. Go Suns!
kevinl::pacer fan here,nice game trey burke.
ahung::I thought green is nothing but just a high-flying dunker, guess I was wrong.......
THE_CHIEF::I said it before. Plumlee is the key for this team. When he plays with energy and for a double double and defends the rim well, they win. Every game he has played like this has been a L. He has got to work on bringing it on a night in night out basis.
mike::WOW is Kanter struggling so much that the Jazz would really rather start Richard Jefferson? Or are they just that desperate for 3pt shooting?
