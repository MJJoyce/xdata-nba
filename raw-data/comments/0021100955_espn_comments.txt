The funny names are taken::poop http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/conversation?gameId=320422008
Reality_And_Truth::Greg Monroe and Brandon Knight have been good young additions for the Pistons to build a future around..........
Bouncepass McNabb::It would serve both these teams right to get contracted out of the league for this performance.
N.YCowboysfan::b
cubsfan128::greg monroe. BEAST
texasrangersin12::I’ve been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over $3,000 a month for three months straight now following this system. I found this system by Google searching the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for anyone out there that is looking for a system that actually works and is tired of not winning your bets like I once was

johnnny_drama34::Great tanking coaching strategy Casey by not playing Derozen in the 4th. Kudos Kudos - from loyal Raptor fan
kozanski2000::Bad result for Golden state.
JujuBeanYum::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKLAzyWiC4
trademarktaz::Go Pistons! We're coming back.
Ryan59264::Nobody involved in this game today deserves to get a paycheck.
lehmanator123::this was as blatant of a tank job as ive seen. DeRozan benched in the 4th after playing so well? Absurd.
det_rules::so were both teams trying to lose this game? the FG % was horrendous
minick_man83::Did anyone actually watch this entire game?
DetroitSportsFan90::when is the nba draft again?
Reality_And_Truth::The Pistons need Harrison Barnes.....
JujuBeanYum::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKLAzyWiC4
Grant8840::Unfortunately we are not bad enough to get MKG. But, Terrence Jones is not bad either
Reality_And_Truth::Terrence Jones will be a bust.....Harrison Barnes, John Henson, or Moe Harkless would all be better selections.......
torontoraps054::Pistons should take Perry jones or terrance jones. Sullinger is a flop.   Sullinger= brandon bass/ big baby davis
Reality_And_Truth::Sullinger is another Corliss Williamson waiting to happen, under sized no jumping ability and slow off his feet....Terrence Jones will also be a bust.....Perry Jones, Harrison Barnes, John Henson, and Moe Harkless are all better selections....
Mad31nD3troit::Who are the Pistons looking at/should take in the draft
Reality_And_Truth::Won't get MKG or Perry Jones.....take Harrison Barnes, Moe Harkless, or John Henson.......
Ruediculous::This mock draft has us taking Austin Rivers... OH GOD NO.
kingz3290::enjoy
Reality_And_Truth::Austin Rivers is just terrible....he is over rated and not physical at all...weak upper body....terrible shot selection.....terrible passer....poor defender......cry baby.......drives well but can not finish with his left hand.....
torontoraps054::Kobrick 2.0
detroitfan911::Bye people, this is the first time I have been on a Pistons board all year, and it will be the last. BUT GO PISTONS!
torontoraps054::tanking is totally worth it in this years draft class. Extremely deep draft.   Hope bobcats get #1, i honestly feel sorry for them
Ryan59264::Kobe Bryant was drafted by Charlotte.
Ruediculous::That place is a curse for all draft picks, name one that has lived up to the hype.... I'll wait
torontoraps054::Anthony davis+ raptors =  playoffs next year  If only we get lucky
Ruediculous::Tanking is pathetic.
kingz3290::it's easy to say that as a fan but you're not the owner paying these players looking for a cost-effective savior to come in and contribute on a rookie scale contract.
kingz3290::Harrison Barnes=Linas Kleiza basically, they play the same game essentially. Big body jumpshooters
Reality_And_Truth::Harrison Barnes is much more talented.....needs to drive more........
Grant8840::why can't you lose a couple more Detroit
Ruediculous::Lol at that Raptor fan that thinks Harrison Barnes is falling to them.
kingz3290::Harrison Barnes is a tool. All he can do is shoot. No thanks, we dont want him.
Reality_And_Truth::Harrison Barnes is a good defender and rebounder....he lacks ball handling skills to get his own shot.....
Ruediculous::That's not what torontoraps is saying lol.
torontoraps054::Droummon isn't bad either
torontoraps054::Next 2 raptors games..................   Milwaukee vs raptors- L  New jersey vs raptors-  W/L not sure
detroitfan911::Anybody else see the bunt off of the knee earlier today? Can't get over that
detroitfan911::i would rather have a slump right now though and be 10-6
MansGame5313::tell me about. Most disappointing thing right now though is the bats. But its been cold by june we gonna be on fire
detroitfan911::ruediculous u saw this right?
detroitfan911::yeah they are getting quite frustrating to watch
Ruediculous::I'm over it though. We should of scored more. Going 1-2-3 in5 consecutive innings is pathetic, I knew we would lose.
DreAllDay1988::Which sounds better? St. Louis Raptors or St. Louis Pistons?
MansGame5313::Both make me want to throw up
detroitfan911::raptors
detroitfan911::Hold on, the Pistons are above .500 at home?!?! Never realized that
kingz3290::RAPTORS JUST WON THE BRADLEY BEAL SWEEPSTAKES!!!!
torontoraps054::wooohooo
torontoraps054::haha pistons will be the bobcats of next year. Enjoy your 9-11 pick detroit!   GOO Raptors
Ruediculous::So you think we will regress? We play hard every night with this squad any big man that they draft that can contribute will be a plus. The Raptors are a mess, just as much as we are. You're here typing: "HARRISON BARNES." Like he is a lock to fall to you.
MansGame5313::I think the Pistons was feeling happy they had the lead then realized wait we trying to lose
Ryan55772::So which one of these teams will make the deepest run in the playoffs? ......
MansGame5313::Pistons no doubt
detroitfan911::Go back just under a decade and definitely the Pistons. hahaha
torontoraps054::raps next year
Ruediculous::Next year? Wake up, sir.
torontoraps054::Detroit&lt;3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thank you!!!!!!!!
torontoraps054::Harrison barnes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!thank you detroit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ruediculous::You guys are going to need a lot more than that. Isn't DeRozan a 3?
detroitfan911::And the Detroit Pistons improve to 24-40!!! OH MY!
Ruediculous::How dysfunctional.
Skip1.4ppg Bayless::lol double choke job
