10xRoc::Not that big of a deal, Grizzlies are just a better team.
----------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS----------::HAHAHAHA.LOL AT CUBANS PUNK @SS
epochme::28 rbs, the team is sending the rapist a message- which he ignores because- he's a rapist
----------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS----------::DUDE YOU ARE A STUPID
epochme::28 rebounds as a team. DH is going to beat you down kobe- you better get him the damn ball.
epochme::rapist- worst shooting night of the entire laker team- every player
epochme::Second game in a row that kobe shot more than twice as much as any other laker... and they lost... again. Kobe, dh is the new king in town and you are or should be the second or third option... dude you are old, 7/23 really- next time just take all the shots, 14/46. brilliant
Janet6838::"Mitch: please accept my apologies. You and the Buss clan were correct: this team was built for D'Antoni's system. I was wrong. No way in 'heck' would Phil and his championship Triangle was fit for this older, injured, half court team."  Magic
patchie04::Bryant walked off the court and to the locker room before the game was over showing was a classless quitter he really is.  I could care less about his talents at this point, the man is an egotist and a cancer.  Merely a week after he slammed a teammate for not playing at full speed he quits and walks off the court before the game was over.
DSeel23::In order for the Lakers to be as good as their roster shows it is, Kobe needs to instead of taking 20+ shots a game and Dwight/Pau need to both put up 15+ shots a game. With that formula the Lakers would be unstoppable down low as they share power and finesse. That being said, I'm not too worried they will do much as Kobe knows how to play one type of ball, Kobe ball (or Mamba ball if you want to put his ego in there some more)
tenntitans06::wow now that was classless... way to show the kids good sportsmanship kobe
richka523::The Lakers had a choice.  Jackson who is great for centers and bad for point guards.  Or, D'Antoni who is the opposite.  Not sure why they chose D'Antoni who favors point guards when Howard is the one they want to keep.
RjEddy919::might sound crazy but imagine this..starting lineup: nash, kobe, mwp, jamison, howard...second unit: blake/morris, meeks, ebanks, hill, gasol. we would have an immediate top 5 bench and as long as pau still produces he can finish the games. just not start them.
Ceequel91::looks good on paper, but gasol will be catching the ball out of position and swarmed with that bench
RjEddy919::might sound crazy but imagine this..starting lineup: nash, kobe, mwp, jamison, howard...second unit: blake/morris, meeks, ebanks, hill, gasol. we would have an immediate top 5 bench and as long as pau still produces he can finish the games. just not start them.
yappy cappie 15864::LAKERS ARE A BUNCH OF OVERRATED BUMS !
Chute99::15+ Seasons in the NBA and Kobe still doesn't know how to consistently get his teammates involved.  He's not the best player on the team and it's time for him to realize that.  His shooting %s are coming back to normal and it will be a disaster come February when they hit that heavy Grammy road trip.  It's simply nothing impressive about this team.
SashaNein::The lightbulb clicked in Jordan's head 7 years into his career thanks to a kick in the $@% by Phil Jackson against the Lakers in the finals and he went on to become the greatest of all time, but Kobe will never learn.
EL_ABALLARDE::It's time to chant "We want Phil" "We want Phil" You Phil me??
yappy cappie 15864::Dude its way to late for that ! your stuck with Mr.puterschmit (family guy for those who don''t know who he is)
XhinghFu::For all those who believe that stats don't lie-- Kobe Bryant 2012 Stats... SPLITS	GP	MPG	FG%	RPG	APG	BLKPG	STPG	PFPG	PPG  In Wins	6	35.0	.480	6.5	7.2	0.0	1.5	3.0	23.3 In Losses	7	38.3	.529	4.0	3.3	0.0	1.4	2.7	31.0
Ceequel91::People who look at stats are so shortsighted. Most of the time when Kobe shoots that much is because his teammates arent hitting their shots or they are already down by a huge deficit
Chute99::It's only a 13 game sample size.  Kobe's %s are coming down to normal.
Dj3garrett::It's crazy how he's been in the league for so long and still doesn't get that by being an all around team player makes everyone better and your team... I know he's won 5 rings with his playing style, but imagine if he was a team player and got along with Shaq?
diehardnr1::Dwight and/or Gasol will be next on his scapegoat list
Inbound_the_Ball::Anyone who is counting on Nash to save the day... should realize it will be a little bit before he is in game shape. He hasn't even been able to jog. And he's older, which means that it will take him much longer to get back to being Steve Nash.
XhinghFu::If the NBA had rules for 'offensive' flopping, Kobe Bryant would average about 16 points a game for career.
Chute99::Yep, he seems to be getting bailed out a lot this year.  His FTA stats are deceiving because they are coming more a result of ticky tack fouls when the team is in the bonus as opposed to him going to the rack.
cfgenesis::Kobe must really not want Dwight to re-sign, he shoots 7-23 while Howard only gets 7 shots in 39 minutes.  He has to see how ineffective that is.
Chute99::Kobe wants to win it his way.  But we all know his teams go nowhere without premium big man talent.
Chute99::"Shut up, stupid Lakers fans!!!! I walked out on the team last night and you still will kiss my **s and not blame me. Just like when I've quit in games before. So shut up, buy my shoes, believe my 'injury' stories and never blame me."   ----Kobe Bryant
Ronin565::Uh oh, time to fire D'Antoni...
JimBUSSisaHERO::Kobe walked away from a rape case what's the big deal about leaving the game early ?
jacrone1::Gotta love it... Griz have beaten the Lakers, Heat, Knicks, Thunder, and Rockets... I hope the media continues to let them fly under the radar... Griz have cohesion as a team, everyone else has a bunch of superstars with huge egos...
Ceequel91::as a lakers fan, thank you for commenting about the grizzlies. this board is full of 99% lakers haters and lakers bandwagoners
diehardnr1::Nuggets dont need no dirty stinking radar or  Superstars to beat Northeast Arkansas finest...its Grizzly Hunting Season in the Rockies all season long...just a reminder while you are all up on the fluke hot start...ala MLB LA Dodgers in April...the reason for no respect is you have to earn it first. At  least a WC Finals and then the pundits will notice y'all  But hey...Nice start...
diehardnr1::riiight...  hit a nerve huh?
machinegunkelley80::Kill yourself
caram66::Let me guess, Kobe needs more help?!
William51796::Kobe.....23 shots....Look no further !
alec613::MIke D'Antoni will get fired  Mike Dunleavy will replace him.  time to perfect the trifecta!
nba is the worst::"I'm good with that - don't want to have to learn a new name, I'm under enough pressure".  -Dwight
dwight getting advice from melo on how to get dantoni fired::<b>lakers will go through 1 coach per month - book it</b>
OHIO STATE 34TH DEGREE MASTER MASON::LAKERS AT THE END OF 2013 SEASON  1. KOBE CRYING ABOUT TRADE 2. HOWARD LEAVES FOR BROOKLYN 3. NASH RETIRES.....RINGLESS 4. D'ANTONI FIRED
alec613::Brooklyn can't have Dwight though? They'll have to find someone who would take Brook's contract for free for that to happen
alec613::Nets are way over the cap, so they cant sign Dwight as a FA
dwight getting advice from melo on how to get dantoni fired::why not?
alec613::Dwight = no post game, and the ball usually gets stripped from him Gasol = excellent post game, but D'Antoni is using him a stretch 4  Time to ship him out now. Any stretch 4 would definitely help the Lakers
dwight getting advice from melo on how to get dantoni fired::ship him out = dwight = agreed
dwight getting advice from melo on how to get dantoni fired::dantoni isn't the problem... dwight isn't lifting a finger... 4 rebounds??  lmao... the system has nothing to do with that... just lazy...
Baseline Move::"Kobe Bryant scored the final 14 points of the game for the Lakers ..."  I see Dantoni's offense will really focus on spreading the ball around and keeping everyone involved.
Bynum24 Spurs23::Mike D'Antoni is the best fit coach for Kobe.
machinegunkelley80::ItPeople saying grizzles won't last don't understand basketball. The reason the grizzles are playing so well is because they've been together four years. They have chemistry  r
dwight getting advice from melo on how to get dantoni fired::lmao
Pealvin::Lost a ton of respect for Kobe, I never had much in the first place but, Walking off the court with 10 secs left in the game was weak! He in Dwight will have words soon if they havent already.
dwight getting advice from melo on how to get dantoni fired::dwight is the weakest link
oneandonlybabe::The Lakers are so dysfunctional they should do a reality show with one of those TV doctors.  Imagine getting to see Kobe-Pau-Dwight behind the scenes? Ratings guaranteed. Laker Rehab - Make it happen E!
machinegunkelley80::Win as a team lose as a individual.
BasketballTensai::what's the deal? I told you to win Lakers.
nba is the worst::Remember I said 6-8 early in the week - 1 more left to prove me wrong
jessica_rabbit17::The reason Kobe walked off the court in a dummy spat is he now realises that his team is a joke and he will never win another ring!!!ha
u2cangetthebozack::"The Lakers are going to go 75-7" - Laker fans before the season started "They're perfectly capable of winning 69 in a row" - the same morons now
Road dog Red::D'Antoni may look good in a suit.. but i have a feeling..THIS is going to get UGLY
Road dog Red::Lets see.. Kobe BallHawg was 7-23.. wtf.. only 23 attempts.... someone is taking away his shots,,,
BuffaloBiLLiaM::yeh...its called the grizzlies
Road dog Red::Well LA..... there's always the Clippers
Brandon_Oki::As much as Lakers suck at the moment, we all know its chemistry issues. What can you say for the celtics lol? Ya just thrash
TheBear_Snuggles::Golden State looking better than LA
nba is the worst::So are the Kings!
jessica_rabbit17::No wonder phil said no to the lakers after his last playoff series he got swept by the grandad mavs 4-0 2 seasons ago as defending chumps!!!lol
nba is the worst::When did Phil say no?  Please continue posting though - EPIC self ownage!
LakerHeadsReckoning211::It would be poetic justice, though, if the Laker$ DID miss the playoffs, so they would finally get punished for neglecting the draft.
nba is the worst::Well then, "may it be so"!
