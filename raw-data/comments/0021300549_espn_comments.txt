Will Correa::More proof Dirk is an all time great. 38 points tonight!,
Bill Geary::40 !
Will Correa::More evidence!!
Dustin Clendenin::Go mavs!
Sina Soheili::Sam Dalembert is like most big guys in the NBA. Give him touches early in the 1st Q get him 1 or 2 dunks maybe some foul shots & get him engaged a bit. We got to improve our defense & stop taking outside shots all the time. Im looking for 10-13 mins from Ledo like yesterday playing with the starters in the 2ndQ. Man,i would love to see him do well & get consistent PT from the bench!!! Pelicans fans u got a cornerstone beast for years to come in the Unibrow Antohny Davis & with a new team nickname & identity u guys got a very bright future & I would have loved to see UCLA's Jrue Holiday play but as a Mavs fan I say Let's go MAVS!!!
Chris Cotten::Please please please fire Monty Williams! To not even argue the obvious foul at the end! Monty you sir suck!!!
Joseph Michael O'Neill::The mavs are one more star away from a championship dirk and Ellis can't do it by them selves
Raymond Dunn::The problem is Cuban can't recruit a big name to Dallas.
Aeron Uchiha::Let us do it right this time. Play like a team. Go MAVS!!!
Eriko Jim::Dirk still doing his thang...dam dude married a black African girl despite all the blonde chicks in Dallas ,
Bryan Dacuno::Waiting for the press release of the NBA about Ellis' non called foul..
Scott Struble::We heard Dirk was beating Pelicans. -PETA
Sean Cerreta::These teams can't score, pathetic.
Dallas Dunn::42 points in a quarter. How do you feel now moron?
Scott M Higginbotham::what? are you kidding?  have you ever played other than sandlot?  you sound like a lib arts major from new England.  no clue.....
Sean Cerreta::Dallas Dunn , I made the statement midway through the second quarter dickhead.
Mc TopRamen::Nasty  That is how a 35 year old can play
Joel May::More like 40 !
