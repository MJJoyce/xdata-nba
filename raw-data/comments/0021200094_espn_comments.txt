mosesbyu::Free Jimmer.
ampasta299::This is the right time for LA to get out of their slump.
MiAmIhEaT3030::well if mike don't work out hire this dude.
ampasta299::who?
ZinBayArea::No laker fan is actually happy with this move...
guidos89::EXTRA EXTRA!!!!! lakers are 3-4 having beat the kings, pistons, and the warriors, while in other news the Clippers are 5-2 having beat memphis, lakers, spurs, portland, and atlanta... CLIPPERS NATION BABY!!!! WE RUN L.A!!!!
Toto1080::Rex Ryan and Mike D'Antoni should coach together
MiAmIhEaT3030::holy s h i t that pic is scary as hell,i wouldn't wanna wake up to that in the morning i punch the s h i t out of her.
IfYouSeeKay.::<b>Hey LA FAKER frauds, maybe Phil Jackson will turn your suck $@% team around...Ooooops...HAHAHAHA I guess NOT!!  LOLOLOLOL...That guru is in total disbelief!!1 LMFAO</b>
24raj::Good Job
jm59::Keith Smart just isn't.  The Hollinger stats are interesting.  Nobody thinks Jimmer is even a top 100 player in the league, but in the top 50 of the Hollinger stats (where he's number 1), nobody is even close to getting as few minutes per game as he is.    It's absolutely ridiculous that he's not playing more.  Isaiah Thomas is averaging exactly 1 assist per game at the point guard spot in his 25 minutes per game.    Here's hoping Jimmer get traded or the next coach (midseason?) figures out he has a solid role player in Jimmer, and actually plays him.
SDSUAZTEC1975::Maybe the lakers will bring in Jimmer.   I'm not sure how good the kid is, but nobody will ever find out if he stays with the kings.  Would love to see him play for dantoni in the purple and gold.
guidos89::Jimmer is like adam morrison.. you want him in your team, i guess you guys just don't want to have a solid bench, i guess you lakers fans are fine with steve blake backing up nash...
TheRydog3::Well technically it was 43. But still. you make a good point
Rhubarbjackson::You should know how good he is after watching him drop 50 on your aztecs.
dstone2962::They haven't even beaten a team with a complete starting five yet outside of Detroit the worst team in the league.  The level of Laker homerism on ESPN is beyond ridiculous.
C.Breezy215::They beat two teams with a combined record of 2-12 is that really an accomplishment? I'm not a Laker hater and would actually like to see them playing well as its good for the sport but come on man when you beat Detroit and Sacramento your just winning games your supposed to win and that shouldn't really give you any sense of relief.
C.Breezy215::My bad the beat the Warriors not the Pistons in that span of games. Meh still not a good team but better than the Pistons so the Lakers get a few more points for that win.
rugby107::Fredette goes for 18 points in 10 minutes? And people say he's no good.
LOSANGELES1980::Lakers are &amp; always will be the best team ever...I dont care what anybody says LAKERS ALL THE WAY, WEST-UP
CUBAN HONEY.::Celtics 17  Lakers 16
CUBAN HONEY.::Celtics have the most titles with 18
musingmike::Lakers are the best team ever, but it won't necessarily stay that way forever. Forever is a long time. :P It would be insanely difficult for anyone other than the Celtics to catch up anytime soon though. Lakers have 17 titles, Celtics 16, and Bulls in at 3rd with 6.
TheRydog3::Celtics have 18....
elchupanibre6::Once again, the Lakers are focusing WAY too much on offense and not on defense. This hire proves it.
CUBAN HONEY.::Mike dantoni is not good when it comes to team defense  Yeah Dwight can alter a shot every on in a while but that won't save them. Both Kobe and artest defense is highly overrated at this point in their career. Nash has never heard of defense before face it this team will not win anything but it was fun listening to arrogant lakers fans the last few day.
TheRydog3::Not gonna happen, but okay
CUBAN HONEY.::Yes papi.
musingmike::Get over your blind hatred. Lakers are 2-0 in their past 2 games...period. Nothing you say changes that. What if they beat SA on Tuesday? Will you shut up then?

middleman257::Phils EGO is out of control and I would of passed him over too. He is not bigger than the Lakers franchise. Now Phil and his EGO can have plenty time to hang out together, maybe go to the movies or fly a kite together or something. Give Bernie a shot.
George7844::middleman257 -......"Phils EGO is out of control and I would of passed him over......"  What the flock does "would OF" mean????  It doesn't make any frkn SENSE !!!
colosportsman::Phil Is a championship level coach. He has a reason to have an ego. The only example the Lakers are setting is how to fail as a basketball team. I think their managemant has gone senile.
stingfan1985::It figures Cousins would be suspended just hours before the tip-off of the game.  The Kings have owned the Lakers this preseason and beat them three times and Cousins matches up very well against Howard. Yes, I know Cousins is a knucklehead, but to not let him play against the Lakers seems very suspicious in its timing.The Commissioner knew that the Fakers were in turmoil and to fall further behind the superior Clipper's team would be bad for business (at least in his biased Laker Loving eyes). Assuming the Commissioner's Office had this information on-hand, why not act on it sooner and more proactively?  The Kings probably win this game if they're not down two players. This is yet one more reason to hate the Lakers even more.
colosportsman::Mike D'Antoni ...what where the Lakers thinking. Gonna be the LA SUns now..No D.
laztancient::No where near the same roster. Are you kidding me? Replace Jeremy Lin with KIdd (number 2 all time in steals) or even Felton is a huge improvement. Replace Fields with J. R. Smith for the whole year, and A'mare is out and his D is awful. Melo actually looks like he has improved on defense this year and Tyson Chanler is always a beast on D. But to say the roster is the same is a joke. They have less than half their roster from last year. 40% to be exact (6/15 including J.R. Smith as a return). So you are obviously either blind or you can't read because this roster is a complete makeover.
laztancient::It certainly is possible to play D in a run n gun system. Nobody on the Suns or the Knicks actually PLAYED defense. Amar'e, Nash, Melo, and don't even get me started on Jeremy Lin's defense. Are they going to be as good defensively under D'antoni as Phil Jackson or even Mike Brown? Of course not. But they will be much better offensively and the defense will be able to hold its own.
C.Breezy215::Yet the Knicks under a different system with many of the same players are one of the best defensive teams in the league at this point in the season.
laztancient::You're an idiot if you think Kobe, Dwight, and Metta World Peace (YEAH I SAID IT!) are going to stand back and not play D. Shows how much you actually think before you type. Not at all apparently.
colosportsman::You do realize that D is not possible in a run n gun system . I don't care who you are...the players are always out of position.
treezeyforsheezey::I never thought I'd say this, but will the Lakers please trade for jimmer?
SDSUAZTEC1975::I agree.  I think watching him play for Dantoni would be fun.  I say give him a chance.  Obviously, the kings have no intention of letting him play more than junk minutes.  Keith Smart ain't too smart.
Jai22T::With the Lakers bench being bad,they have to get more scoring from Pau Gasoft.He has a smaller player on him every night and he's making top dollar.He's getting softer and softer.......
Germany858::move to 2-0 since firing Mike Brown. damn, they've played the Kings and Warriors.
Jimmerisabeast::Way to be a boss with only 11 min. Jimmer!
treezeyforsheezey::#freeJIMMER
Kevbot20::Be SMART with Jimmer and send him to L.A. I'd take Jimmer over Blake to back Nash up any day
mrpacker8::TRADE JIMMER
TheRydog3::So Fredette plays  10 minutes and still leads the team in scoring..... Hmm.... And he still won't play....
SDSUAZTEC1975::As a laker fan, i say bring him to l.a.
Kevbot20::As an SDSU fan it would also probably be nice to have him on your side for once too huh?
TheRydog3::Because the Kings want to play their one on one playground crap
Count_IT33::18 points in 11 minutes, that's productive.  Why isn't he getting more minutes?
AvtomatKalashnikov504::Well so much for the conspiracy theory, the only thing constant in life is change. This is not only a shock to the laker fans but to the nba world as a whole ! Much love to the big dog,	PJ ! Good luck down the stretch Lakers, from a Celtic fan !
PHELPS DA BEST::Finding it tough to come to terms with this d'antoni hiring when Phil and Sloan were WIDE OPEN. this better work out or else Jim Buss is gonna take a HAMMERING in the press.
OBAMA 2016.::wow d'antoni huh.. could handle the knicks how he gonna handle the lakers?
nba is the worst::Lakers give up an avg of 83.5 ppg under Bickerstaff - lakers better keep him
terryau12::Ummmmmmm.......uhhhhhh...wait........uhhh they played the kings???? Not anything to get a big $@%! about
jfranchiz::well considering they lost bad to the Blazers and Jazz, I will take any win.
YoHongBroutha::Where be duh D-Marcus Where do he be?  Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo  Why he no be here, rebounding fo' me.
George7844::Lookie heah, Dawg !! How you be durrin ??? Sho be glad someone finally usin' correct Ebonics up in heah fo a change. Dem daah wannabees wuz about 2 drive me crazy. Sho wuz !!!
Dillon Criner::Move over guys Im riding this bandwagon all the way to the Chip.
mvbortolin::in case any of you forgot, ebanks got a dui a couple days ago thats why he didnt play. not because of his ability.
Charley Varrick::Fredette gets 11. Minutes and 18 pts. I guess playing for a bigoted coach does have its challenges!!!
78Bevan::After 6 games, Jimmer is at 33.5 PER.  Anyone with a 33.5 PER is the runaway league MVP
biglump41::One game
KYRIEALLTHEWAY::IM HAPPY THAT THE LAKERS FINALLY WON THANK THE LORD
treezeyforsheezey::18 points in 11 minutes. HOW IS HE NOT STARTING?!
78Bevan::Jimmer now has a PER of 33.5 And averages the least minutes per game of all players.
durham_standup::he should get more minutes, but he's not going to keep up those numbers against another team's starters.
Charley Varrick::Because either Smart cant coach or hes a racist. I'll take both.
78Bevan::biglump41 - Did you clowns not see Fredette in summer league?second tier players routinely made jimmer look less than ordinary.  The summer league is irrelevant.
purple-and-gold::^ Not a Jimmer fan (or hater), but you're talking summer league. Not even preseason, but summer league. That's just a joke.
biglump41::Did you clowns not see Fredette in summer league?second tier players routinely made jimmer look less than ordinary.
blazzn92::What happend to Ebanks?
DAVEEVERTSEN::Looks like Mr. Fredette finally will get some playing time. Well done, boy! 11 minutes, 18 points!!!
78Bevan::No King has a 20 PER, but Jimmer has a 33.5!
LAfanforlife805::mike, it seem like you dont like change if you keep the same staff you had with the suns and knicks. some laker coaches deserve a chance  to stay
AussieRaven52::At least Bickerstaff deserves to stay
Tony91367::I am pretty Sure Chuck Person and Darvin Ham will stay around
LAfanforlife805::yea he does 2-0 with the team playing better d even if it the kings with out it starting C and the warriors
kinsman135::D'Antoni is not the answer..  He's allergic to Defense!
George7844::How about Krzyzewski ???
LAfanforlife805::well who would be better who not name phil?

Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::Lakers need some serious help.
5-0 49ers::Hahaahaha! You guys are gonna win it all with PJ! Jokes on you, be careful what you wish for!
AGV345::Kobe will get pissed off if they trade Pau.
George7844::Bein' pissed OFF is bettah dan bein' pissed ON !!!  Sho is !!!
jenni90269::he should be  gasol led the lakers to a title in 2010 and koME got all the credit
stats0824::I told that joke isn't funny ur making ur self look stupid
jenni90269::dan gilbert is the sole reason behind kobe's absence from this year's all defensive team.  the voters usually give kobe a free pass, but the lakers defense became the league's worst after gilbert sent the lakers ramon sessions.
jenni90269::gilbert also blocked the cp3 trade  then when odom learned his name was included, he wanted out  then gilbert comes back and offers sessions for 2 first round picks  wow
.Batman.::wasn't kobe all defense 2nd team
jenni90269::there are a bunch of seasons koME didn't deserve to be on the team  after the first 3-peat, he started to decline  for example, he played zero defense the seasons he chased the scoring record
.Batman.::lol i'm not into conspiracy's and rigged voting, but I agree Kobe isn't the defender he once was and probably shouldn't have made even the 2nd team the last year or 2.  They didn't really lose anything with Sessions though. Fisher sucked on defense.
jenni90269::kobe usually makes first team even though he focuses mostly on his scoring  last year his defense got so bad that even the rigged voters couldn't go through with it
AGV345::@kevinDing:"Mitch Kupchak called Phil Jackson late tonight to notify him that the Lakers had just signed Mike D'Antoni"....wow did they seriously let phil down like that??
gerald_5::why do laker fan need to compare there guys with everyone?? why so insecure?? like:  phil&gt;eric Spo kobe&gt;Brian Scal dwight&gt;kwami
--L.A LAKERS DODGERS--::Why not :)
jenni90269::white mamba &gt; black hole mamba
gerald_5::that one is close...
LAfanforlife805::heat fans always use to compare lebron to kobe
scabbfan::lebron was always better than kobe.
.Batman.::all fans do that.
