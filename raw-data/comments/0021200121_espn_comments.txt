lakers will be 2013 champs::kennith faried sould be a power forward
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::u really are a lakers fan.
jpsoxfan15::GK needs to wake up and play JaVale McGee. Gallinari needs to step up also.  Its still early and I think the Nugs are gonna have a special year.  **** the Heat
nba is the worst mother gives good BJs::
Ms._Know_It_All::bull
Ms._Know_It_All::BS
nba is the worst mother gives good BJs::huh?
Heat_Master_Sage::I think Karl needs to sallow  his pride and start mcgee dude would destroy most centers
Heat_Master_Sage::If he played like a champ.. den could be hard to beat in the west
Heat_Master_Sage::18 and 6 is good for only 21 mins of play. I know his head is in the wrong place but he could be the second best center in the nba
charlie hustle bets the over::that's the thing.  he's been working out the kinks in his basketball IQ this year. he's really progressing. like you guys said, so athletic.   never woulda thought that mcgee would be playing better than lawson/gallo this early in the year.
Rambomonster9::i have been saying he needs more minutes for 3 years.  the guy is a freak.  20 12 and 4 guy with starter minutes.  sooo athletic
charlie hustle bets the over::Heat_Master_Sage -   you think  he would trade mcgree for haslem, miller, and joel? :P -------------------- i would. obviously heat wouldn't.  need a few more pieces from denver to sweeten the deal.  but ya ain't getting iggy a.k.a. the only semblance of defense we have.
jpsoxfan15::$@%! the Nugs arent doing that for some old players. Part of me is really tempted however. We need solid three point shooters and a consistent veteran big to come off the bench
Rambomonster9::I might even take Faried/McGee for Bosh/Haslem
Heat_Master_Sage::charlie hustle bets the over - those 3 would definitely help the nuggets shooting woes. i don't think mcgee can be traded for a while, though (not that masai would, anyway). though for allen/haslem/miller, man he'd definitely consider it, i know i would) would probably have to swap one of those guys with joel.  you think  he would trade mcgree for haslem, miller, and joel? :P
charlie hustle bets the over::those 3 would definitely help the nuggets shooting woes.  i don't think mcgee can be traded for a while, though (not that masai would, anyway).   though for allen/haslem/miller, man he'd definitely consider it, i know i would)  would probably have to swap one of those guys with joel.
Rambomonster9::he would actually be thee PERFECT fit fot the Heat.  A big who can run, defend and rebound!!!!?? wow.  I would trade Allen, Miller, and Haslem for him and garbage in a heartbeat
EricDavis0822::The Nuggets are a bad team this year  but give the Heats some credits for showing up at 4 a.m. in the mourning and willing themselfs to a win.
Rambomonster9::The Heat are gonna start to lose a ton of games because of hoe many extra shots (offensive rebounds) the other team are getting.  Heat getting destroyed on the glass
nbabasketball1982::They need to play Joel Anthony more. His a really good defender and rebounder.
Heat_Master_Sage::You would have a massive fan revolt
Rambomonster9::i know.... just a thought.  i love Wade but man he has dropped off alot in the past couple years
Heat_Master_Sage::yeah but considering miami only has vet min. really no tradeable pieces. to get a quality big without giving up one of our better players is impossible
Rambomonster9::wade?
Heat_Master_Sage::Eh if they feel worried they will prob go for martin and than if need to. maybe trade
Rambomonster9::i have heard alot about Martin.... but he is not really a big and the best part of his game was his athletisism and that is gone.  what is he 36 years old and maybe 6' 9''
Heat_Master_Sage::I think it says something they near got oureboudned by 20, without wade and won in denver
Rambomonster9::true.  i love the Heat but not having a Center and only 1 true power forward is dangerous.  Should have picked up blatche.  Time for a trade
rkini1::2 games = drought?   wow.
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::no u idiot.  we never wo in Denver since 2002, TEN YEARS!!!  that drought lol
Heat_Master_Sage::cbb do you trust people to fix ps3 problems?
KYRIEALLTHEWAY::IM LITE WAY SALTY THE HEAT WON LAST NITE BUT IN W\ A WAY IDC
cbbaseball19::This list kills me!  MIAMI   Out  DB Deon Bush (upper extremity) Surgery/Out for the season:  LB Ramon Buchanan (lower extremity) RB Eduardo Clements (upper extremity) DB Davon Johnson (lower extremity) OL Ben Jones (lower extremity) WR Malcolm Lewis (lower extremity) WR Robert Lockhart Jr. (lower extremity) LS Sean McNally (lower extremity)
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::smh.. hurricanes
nba is the worst::derp
nba is the worst::Soccer sucks! ;)
YouKiddinMe8::Nuggs would have won if that bogus charging call didn't happen on Lawson in the closing minutes (or if Gallo didn't decide to shoot a 3 about a foot short of the hoop)  Either way, Nuggets need to get it together
charlie hustle bets the over::ha, gallo is the reason nuggs lost. his "air"ball "deflated" his team and the crowd.  see what i did there??
charlie hustle bets the over::hahaha nice
timmy14612::Deflated?  I suppose he is going to be the next ball boy for the USC Football team :)
88bryant18::Before last night, NBA teams on the second night of a back-to-back traveling back East were 0-42 in Denver and 3-39 against the spread.  Heat snapped both streaks.
Rambomonster9::wow
suchita216::James is SF, center, point guard and everthing.  He is the scorer, most asissts and rebounds.  Amazing thing is what can't James do.
timmy14612::Yeah that's a big stretch trying to say he's a Center.  But he can play 1-4.  If he plays the 4 that's a small lineup but he can do it.  The best way to sum him up is an elite point forward.
nba is the worst::He's no center - do you watch the games vs teams that have centers?
timmy14612::Not sure some people realize how good Lebron is.  The Heat have a lot of faults but he covers them up.
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::im just gonna be a bad az and play Black Ops 2 while at work.
Dem_Canes_Man::Duty call fellas!  I will try to get back in. Later!
cbbaseball19::I know how that goes! :)
chocolate covered caterpillars::ty lawson 0-7 LOL  garbage
brandonlee561heat22::oh snap, dcm whats up
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::if u wanna talk about whats not up, lets talk about the dolphins and marlins, SMHHHH
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::canes are gettin there 8)
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::still first in the ACC coast tho
Dem_Canes_Man::Yo! What it is B!?  The Canes are definitely not up right now? :(
cbbaseball19::Davon Johnson knee surgery. Out for the rest of the season. Hurns has a broken thumb, Malcolm Lewis already out.
brandonlee561heat22::They have played alright, need to win out coming down the stretch here
cbbaseball19:::(
charlie hustle bets the over::not mad nuggs lost, heat are a great team. mad HOW they lost.  lolGallinari's airball, killed momentum. plus ty was worthless last night.
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::Gallo Linned it, bro.
charlie hustle bets the over::he sure did, man, he sure did.
Dem_Canes_Man::Gentlemen!
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::damn glad to see the same heat fans here from 3 years ago :)
cbbaseball19::Look who it is!
cbbaseball19::Finally getting some playing time! 50% beyond the arc and 5 boards.
Dem_Canes_Man::T!  I see you boy Mike was in the building last night!
nba is the worst::Hey - howzit?
nba is the worst::Dem_Canes_Man - nba is the worst - Still plenty of defensive fanboys, but they can't keep me down long  Lol..I feel you dude! Hey, that plasma is still kicking dude! Probably one of my best investments that I have ever made! _ I still love mine 2 years later
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::i even told u to get the led lol
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::oh $@%!, i remembered u talked about gettin a tv 2 years ago.. u ended up gettin the plasma? o.o how much?
Dem_Canes_Man::nba is the worst - Still plenty of defensive fanboys, but they can't keep me down long  Lol..I feel you dude! Hey, that plasma is still kicking dude! Probably one of my best investments that I have ever made!
nba is the worst::Still plenty of defensive fanboys, but they can't keep me down long
Dem_Canes_Man::What up Worst! Still being banned? ;)
brandonlee561heat22::Nugs are now 51-10 at home, against teams on 2nd night of B2B since '09
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::cole has so much upside, he just needs to be better at ball handling.
brandonlee561heat22::Yea, that was the biggest shot of the game, he just trusted Cole to make the play and luckily it went in
6_23_LBJ_MVP_HOF_CHAMPION::THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD - lebron, wade, and bosh should start using the rio treatment on cole.  rio's improvements are drastically good from his rookie year, cole can be as good.  Cole just need to get more of arc on his shot. Thats about it. You cant fix ballhandling for him, that is like addition in NBA language. It is the most basic of the basics.
brandonlee561heat22::I think he will get there, he is just young, he shows flashes at times, just needs to get more consistent
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::lebron, wade, and bosh should start using the rio treatment on cole.  rio's improvements are drastically good from his rookie year, cole can be as good.
6_23_LBJ_MVP_HOF_CHAMPION::Cole has been practicing his 3 point shot though. He should practice more lol
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::with the way cole was playin in the 4th, i was reallye xpecting an L, but lebron said a big f you and cole hit a huge 3 to make up for his 4th quarter crap.
brandonlee561heat22::Yea almost never, I was sure last night was pretty much a L
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::when was the last time we swept the series against denver? :)  it took us 10 years to finally win in denver lol
cbbaseball19::Suckers!
Kwadwo_Gun::LEBRON is too good for my liking. outside the heat team, i love jeff teague and fariad. they are beasts.
cbbaseball19::Miller only had one foul in 24 minutes unlike dbag Lewis!
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::lol rashard is lucky hes makin shots lol otherwise we woulda cut his az for kenyon martin
brandonlee561heat22::No reason Bosh shouldn't be avg'ing at least 9 boards a game
nba is the worst::If that was a fact then he would be.  "fail" ;)
cbbaseball19::I agree with that.
oblique15::I would take what he gets over the Celtics horrible rebounding
brandonlee561heat22::Its sad really, I dont get it.
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::Mike Miller- 12 points/ 5 rebounds/ 1 assit in 24 mins.  way to step up.
nbabasketball1982::Mike Miller is awesome
cbbaseball19::baller!
brandonlee561heat22::His first start in Atl he didnt do so well, but much better last night
jorgesanz4457::I like joel and miller in the rotation. adds some more size and rebounding
caner4lyf::He's going to start mixing it up. If not the veterans will be dead by the playoffs.
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::i think it depends on our matchup. spo is an idiot, small ball wont work for 82 games and teams will figure out ways to beat it. if he mixes it up, there is no way to coach against the heat
William51796::Ty ......0 points !....Wow ! What happened !
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::Joel Anthony happened. lol jk had an off night i guess. and heat made sure brewer would beat them
nba is the worst::.
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::CNN reporting oil rig explosion in the Gulf.  wow another one?  goddamn you BP!
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::lol glad to see nba worst is still alive, remember first seein him angry at the heat in 06.
nba is the worst::Still balling!
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::stay classy ;)
cbbaseball19::Blee!  I know you liked Mikes performance last night!
brandonlee561heat22::Yes, much better last night from his first start. It was refreshing to see him hustling back on defense
brandonlee561heat22::yea pretty much
cbbaseball19::Thats right! Gotta love the Miller mentality
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::it was refreshing to see someone who plays sg hustle back on d for the heat lol
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::MILLER LIGHT!
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::not Mike Miller tho!
cbbaseball19::Miller Light is terrible by the way
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::nice to be back on ESPN boards, using that funky code given to me by mintz.
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::that author code blocker or whatever.
brandonlee561heat22::yea, that works wonders
brandonlee561heat22::which 'code'?
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::i dont always drink beer, but when i do, i prefer Budweiser.
duro.::i dont always drink beer, but when i do, i make sure im within 5 feet of a bathroom bc i cant stop faking urinating
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::stay thirsty my friends.
brandonlee561heat22::Brewer is $@%!$@% horrible
msonic69::Yup, dude is either instant offense/hustle or he can't throw it in the ocean.  Too inconsistent.
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::both brewers, i agree.
nba is the worst::Ronnie's playing well
msonic69::I have to give the Heat a ton of credit, that is one of the best jump shooting games I've ever seen by a road team on the tail end of a back-to-back.  They just didn't miss an open jumper for 3 qtrs and held on.  Nuggz are not in sync and Lawson is lost or maybe secretly injured because he isn't the same player right now.
duro.::would Fins fans rather have Uncle Rico or Tannehill as QB?
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::uncle rico of course, with his sexy football poses.
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::lol tannehill has been terrible lately
cbbaseball19::Uncle Rico???
duro.::hahahah yeah him
cbbaseball19::Ohhhhhhh.  He can throw the pig skin a quarter mile!
nba is the worst::I hear Philip Rivers is available
duro.::4tds in a single game at Polk High
duro.::maybe i should've gone with Al Bundy instead
duro.::from Napolean Dynamite
cbbaseball19::why did my avatar disappear?
THExMOSTxINTERESTINGxMANxINxTHExWORLD::Espn beng Espn.
cbbaseball19::Now its back. WTF
nba is the worst::Other than the (ridiculous) "youngest ever" stats, what is lebron #1 all time in?
limsewan::#1 best player of all time,#1 best all round player of all time,#1 best athletic player taller than 6'4'' of all time,#1 ugliest walking style of all time....want more?
Dj3garrett::How are those ridiculous stats?
Dj3garrett::Same could be said about comparing players from different ERA's...
nba is the worst::If you mean "how are those stats ridiculous", it's because there's no "age multiplier" value add when comparing NBA careers.
duro.::he's number 1 in being criticized by every media outlet imaginable
nba is the worst::Just responding to the "BEST PLAYER TO EVER PLAY THE GAME PERIOD" guy
cbbaseball19::His career isnt even close to over yet...
6_23_LBJ_MVP_HOF_CHAMPION::Seriously, give him AT LEAST five more seasons.
2.3.1 Douple Play::LEBRON IS THE BEST PLAYER TO EVER PLAY THE GAME PERIOD
limsewan::just imagine lebron playing the 80s' and 90s',his stats would have been 40,10,10...lebron is too strong,too athletic for that era.
nba is the worst::2.3.1 Douple Play - LEBRON IS THE BEST PLAYER TO EVER PLAY THE GAME PERIOD ______  Prove it
6_23_LBJ_MVP_HOF_CHAMPION::nba is the worst - And so how do those factors "prove" anything?  The same reason why many media pundits call Jordan the greatest of all time because he changed the NBA culture and brought it to relevance more potently than any other superstar during that time.   THATS THE BIG PICTURE.   You can mention his stats and his championships, but most analysts dont talk about those things but characteristics like "his drive", determination, "Changed the way the game was played" and bulls.hit like that.   I can do that with Lebron, along with his stats. Just saying it is not impossible. <b>Lebron is already started to be treated like a demi-god and you can see it. In about a decade from now, this same discussion will be talked, I guarantee it. You can't escape media hype.<b></b></b>
nba is the worst::And so how do those factors "prove" anything?
6_23_LBJ_MVP_HOF_CHAMPION::nba is the worst - The proof simply isn't available.   Laughing at "the way marketing and mass communication has changed" and "revitalizing a lost position and how the term "superstar" is defined"  Those are solid points if you bring in the internet and advanced stat compilations into the discussion. This was not available 15 years ago. Also the point forward.
nba is the worst::The proof simply isn't available.   Laughing at "the way marketing and mass communication has changed" and "revitalizing a lost position and how the term "superstar" is defined"
6_23_LBJ_MVP_HOF_CHAMPION::You know he can prove it lol. Hell, I can probably write an article that discredits Jordan because of the way marketing and mass communication has changed. How Lebron is revitalizing a lost position and how the term "superstar" is defined.  I can prove it, but I still think that Oscar Robertson is the greatest baller of all time.
Pharohice1906::I guess he is since you say so.
duro.::fantastic avatar
Pusherman3::Nuggets can't shoot 3s or FTs, and their PG is no longer interested in getting into the lane.  Not a good sign.  Another first round knock out....if they get there.
6_23_LBJ_MVP_HOF_CHAMPION::Wow, Lebron is hitting his shots more efficiently than before and people are still saying HE CANT SHOOT???  What's the deal?
nba is the worst::It's obvious he's improved his shooting substantially.  The ft line woes indicate his mental issues are less so
6_23_LBJ_MVP_HOF_CHAMPION::He was never a solid free throw shooter but actually he shoots better near the end of games. Maybe he just doesnt concentrate enough
Dj3garrett::nba is the worst 1. Despite clowns that try to defend against facts using the word "crying", anaysis isn't the same thing.  -------------------------------------------------------- No ones denying that the Heat get more free throw attempts than most teams... They have 2 guys who only like to drive to the rim hates taking jumpshots... You do the math.. It's like you don't understand that... The Heat are a weak jump shooting team so they drive a lot... Of course they're going to get more free throws than a jump shooting team (Pacers, Celtics, Thunder)... This year they've played a lot of away games and Wade and LeBron hasn't been as aggressive as they usually are... I mentioned you "crying" because all you do is talk about "ref help"... If you believe the NBA is rigged so bad, why the hell is it or life?
nba is the worst::"If you believe the NBA is rigged so bag, why the hell is it or life?"  What?  smh
nba is the worst::@ treydey - that's simply false, son
Treydey10::The Heat could have 5 free throws in a game, and NBA Worst would argue that was too many lol. He's anti Heat, so it's hard for him to give any credit to Lebron and the Heat.
duro.::ok this is the second thing i'm agreeing with you on, i was confused as well
Pharohice1906::Lebron does not drive to the basket enough.
nba is the worst::Plenty of stats belie your statement.   One example was in Finals game 4, where westbrook attacked the rim "constantly" and got 3 fts on 32 FGAs, while Wade and Chalmers shooting more jumpers shot 14
Dj3garrett::This year he hasn't been, but I was talking about last years playoffs... Wade and Bron are the reasons why Heat always win the free throw battle... They were constantly attacking the rim...
duro.::he has to stay healthy for the length of the season, driving draws a lot of contact and injuries could happen
