Red Falcons Hat___All Red Hoodie::If the Hawks were healthy, MAYBE we'd be as much of a threat as Philly and Indy. I've come to realize and accept that, as is, we're closer to the Milwaukees of the world instead of Miami and Chicago. So it just feels good to say, at least we didnt lose or get blown out by the Bucks. With a trade or 2, hopefully we can become a  "threat" in the East, but this current roster (and coach) has hit it's ceiling.
FingerRoleJoeTM::GTFOH
joshuaizme::I'm a Bulls fan, but have respect for the Bucks and Hawks and their fans. You guys don't whine when you lose or gloat when you win.  And to be honest, I think if both your teams were healthy, Milwaukee would easily be in the playoffs and Atlanta would be close to Miami and Chicago.
3ptsallday33::"There's a SECOND half?" -the Bucks
BigPage25::lmao
boctorboda3::Bucks are the most un-clutch team ever.
Ryan59262::pathetic, another season of mediocrity. Cant the bucks either just tank for a good draft pick a couple years? S.S.D.D.
Dont make me make you fall in love with a n1gga like me::was at this game, Let me just say Brandon Jennings is disgusting
brattboy99::Are you The Bogut 5 now?
brattboy99::Did the Bucks play tonight?
brattboy99::Where is The Bogut?
brattboy99::Turrible.
dpackrules::WOW,, bucks lose another 4th qtr lead and game!!!  anyone really surprised...
Dillon6446::Yes! Hawks win way to go t-mac
J-SMOOVE2026::pg teague/pargo/kirk sg joe/green/t-mac sf marvin/vlad/stack pf josh/ivan c horford/zaza/collins  yeah, we dont need hinrich anymore.  heck, i think we should trade him into the Lakers trade exception to clear cap room to sign someone like chris kaman.
bilaajo10::joe johnson needs to go
Edward4515::Come on jennings if youre going to say youre gonna keep your options open then while youre with the bucks. Tell the god dam team to tank &amp; get a high lotto pick cause the team is full of scrub d-league players who couldnt even put up 20ppg  in the arctic league. Tank the season please!!
dpackrules::We do,, The lumberjacks,,, More people from wisco go see them then minn....
longdrive715::screw that, just sell the franchise.  Maybe milwaukee could get a nhl or mls team one day instead
calali@earthlink.net::Its kinda weird that MIL doesn't have an NHL team

atlhawks27::i want the hawks to win 5th or 6th seed 3rd  and 4th seed never go any where
J-SMOOVE2026::well yeah, id rather face the magic (perhaps without dwight), pacers, or 76ers than face the bulls or heat in round 1 for sure.
dudemanbro2::the way the hawks have played Orlando this past year i'd actually want to face Orlando the way they are right now
Demonjoe93::I would much rather have the 3rd seed.
The Bogut 6::most retarded logic ever.
Demonjoe93::That Brandon Jennings sure is something though.

The Bogut 6::NO U AINT
atlhawks27::fk you hawks haters
The Bogut 6::Where were you when they were down!!!
The Bogut 6::Bogut's probably sitting on his coach eating ice cream or something.  Fecker always getting injured and costing us entire seasons.
J-SMOOVE2026::Celtics want to trade us KG for Josh.  I say no way unless they throw in ray allen and we throw in kirk hinrich.
calali@earthlink.net::Give us Rondo too

ATLJoe22::I can't believe we just pulled one out with T-Mac, Pargo, Vlad Rad, and STACKHOUSE.... pretty impressive. Too bad we will probably lose by 30 tomorrow
calali@earthlink.net::ATL BABY ATL!!!!!!!
The Bogut 6::Just an amazing coaching job by Scott Skiles, man he is just a genius.
Edward4515::Skiles has got to go, team chokes games when they have a lead. One thing if its against good teams but this year it happened vs the bobcats &amp; kings. He has no idea how to get his team to focus to get back into the game, his rotation &amp; minutes is baffling. Keep going to scrub players even though they cant score while rookies ride the bench &amp; 2-3 years later we wonder why they never reached their potential.
Best Capper::unbelievable in and out
