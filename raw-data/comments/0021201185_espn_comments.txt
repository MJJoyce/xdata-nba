scottpilgrim35::Good to see the Mavs playin hard despite elimination. BUT WHY NOW DOES OJ MAYO HAVE A GOOD GAME?
Genghis Kittah::Lol just saw brewer shot 6-20 lol nice brew keeping it real I se
diehardnr1::Question:  Did Ty coming back help or hurt the Nuggets in this game?  It was good seeing him back...but it seemed the intensity and chemistry was not the same as it had been in the last few games.    Question 2: Ty shot well during his minutes...so why was he not on the court for last shot?  He has proven he can hit the pressure shot...just hard to do from the bench..
jayeteee::Yeah, I'd almost bet if you asked Karl he'd admit he didn't do his best job of rotating players in and out last night. As for Ty, maybe it messed up the chemistry a little, but it's good to get him back and get the bugs worked out of the line-up prior to going into the playoffs.
FCTejas::Love how there is a section called Next 5 games that lists 3 games...
jayeteee::@FCT  Maybe 'cause there's only 3 games left. LOL Not rocket science. Kinda' the same way they may list a team's last 10 games played record when they haven't played 10 games yet. Duh. :-P
diehardnr1::Crunch time for sure....
diehardnr1::The MEM @ LAC is now one of the biggest games in the Nuggets season... Just not sure who to root for.  lol Probably will root for Clipps as Nuggets would still have a half game up and go up a half on the Grizz with a Clippers win..
diehardnr1::GG Mavs...couple more and they can shave the beards...  Not sure If I am more upset with Karl or Miller...because SOMEBODY decided Miller should be 90% of the offense in the OT period! You have Brewer, Iggy, Chandler on the court and Evan/Ty on the bench...yet you call play after play for the oldest, slowest guy on the court...one would think after the first 3 blocked layup "attempts" that you might want to change things up before its too late. smh  DRE IS NOT A CLOSER!!!! wow  The road problems continue...another game another chapter. 3 close games tonight in the race for the 3...DEN was the odd man out in all of them...ugh  Sooooooo...thank god for the tiebreaker keeping Nuggets hopes alive.  This was a HUGE game and Nuggets came up short....another loss and the rosy 3 seed scenario may just turn into a thorny 5 seed nightmare...  This one hurt, almost as bad as the 1 point loss to Spurs.  Oh well...live to fight another day...  GO NUGGETS!!! .
marcusXP3::The Nuggets are a joke without Carmelo Anthony.
jayeteee::@marcus  You're a joke without anything to contribute here. Now go away, kid, you bother me.
diehardnr1::Yeah...I am still laughing at all the one and dones that Melo provides....
gt1master_ike::You know the Nuggets have been providing those same one and dones as well since Melo left. The count is at 2 right now. Just saying.
avsnugsroxbroncs21::Look at the record since the trade, moron
Kobes Achilles::Ouch
NBA Announcer::Were Ya'll watching the end of that Laker game? Unbelievable.
larshook::Well Nuggets you had your chances. Dallas just has our number. Good game Mavs.
NBA Announcer::We won 2-3 didnt we?
TeamworkToo::They're wanting to shave those beards in a bad way.
larshook::Mavs just play us tough. Last game was tough as well. They hit us hard in the paint ...gotta make the few free throws they gave us. All the Nuggs should do from here on out is practice free throws.
Nate3814::ESPN simply cannot stop sucking up to the Lakers. Why not report on good teams?
NFLFanFreak::Hey Mavs do us a Favor and Beat the Grizzles
leon sandcastles69::nuggets 5th, gl fuckt.ards
twosedinsnocup77::Nuggets in third, moron.
Nate3814::Despite this loss, Nuggets are definitely still kicking $@%
NFLFanFreak::Nuggets are still in 3rd .
Stone_Cold96::3 games left, 2 against the Hornets and home against the Girzz. Think the Mavs go into the offseason without those breads? I'm saying yes, so don't disappoint.
AdamFinesse::Lose to the Suns then beat the Nuggets. That's just how our season has been going.
ck675::Our season in a nutshell
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::GG Nuggets. See you later guys..!

gotigersmemphis87::Its in the Forum. I think we got it. We gotta hope you guys lose at least on more. Either way though, I cant wait for the playoffs for both Grizz and Nuggs
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::Rondo played 2 OT on a tore ACL. Kobe can play and feel it tomorrow..!!
brian_millcreek::Don't mess with Leon. He's got to help my Chiefs this year.
SoyMejorQueTu::If Dallas wouldn't be 3-11 in OT and just be .500 in OT (7-7) they'd be 43-36 and headed to playoffs
SoyMejorQueTu::they let the g@ys out of the meat packing factory huh brian?

twosedinsnocup77::"The Suns will get the 1 seed if they win out."  -leon sandcastles69
twosedinsnocup77::Karl is a great coach, he'll have them ready for that game on the road Monday.  Third game in for Ty, he should be looking better.  He didn't even look that bad tonight.
leon sandcastles69::carl huh?
brian_millcreek::And Denver would still have home court.
Peach Yagostein::ok
Peach Yagostein::Dallas has  @ New Orleans ...Lose  H) Memphis .......Lose  H) New Orleans ....win --------------------- 39-40 ..............How the Fork could these chokers not finish .500........LMAO ........40-42

Viktor Karelin::going for 70 lol
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::LOL He loves the spot light..!!
LetsGoMavs-::Mavs would be making the playoffs for the 13th straight year if they played in the East
brian_millcreek::They'd probably be the 3 seed
LetsGoMavs-::Denver would be the 2 seed
Peach Yagostein::IDIOT
LetsGoMavs-::hey idiot. Milwaukee is 37-42 while Mavs are 39-40
genius0182::Mavs playing so they can shave.
Peach Yagostein::LMAO .........Fournier........After the start of the Play-offs the rotation shrinks not increases ...wtf
Young_Guruu::Ty, Miller, AI, Brewer, Chandler, Fournier, Faried, KK, McGee A 9 man rotation is so uncommon in the NBA... LOL.
brian_millcreek::George is going to roll 9, especially at home.
JustineS04::Yeah, until Gallo went down.
brian_millcreek::That has been true in the past, but Karl is out to shock the world.
twosedinsnocup77::leon sandcastles69 - doesn't matter, if memphis goes 2-1 they still win it -------------------------------------------------------------------------- What a moron, I guess he forgot that if they go 2-1, and lets say the Nuggs go 2-1, the Nuggets get it by tiebreaker.  What a dummy.
leon sandcastles69::nuggets lose to portland b/c of ai sucking..
leon sandcastles69::excuse me, 1/2 game morons..
leon sandcastles69::washheightsboy3 - you wre wrong and they are the morons?  wre?

leon sandcastles69::washheightsboy3 - you wre wrong and they are the morons?  wre?
washheightsboy3::you wre wrong and they are the morons?
NFLFanFreak::Up a Game LOL They don't go up a game idiot they go up .5 god u really don't know Basketball
washheightsboy3::he knows.  he's jsut trolling y'all.  no one is that stupid.
leon sandcastles69::if they beat the clippers tomorrow which they will, they'll be up a game
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::0.5 game..!!
washheightsboy3::1/2 game
twosedinsnocup77::Then when the Nuggs win Sunday, Denver will take the 3 seed again.  What a dummy...
leon sandcastles69::they tied now dumb.$@%!
twosedinsnocup77::True, he has to be 12 years old.  I should let him rant, it makes him feel better.
NBA Announcer::It's worthless arguing with this kid.
twosedinsnocup77::No they're not dummy, check the standings, the Nuggs own the third seed.  Dummy...
NBA Announcer::You'll need an English to Troll translator for him to understand.
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::Ignore this fictional football player..!!
Silverio60::im gonna play cards see ya nug fans. be safe
Peach Yagostein::Denver would have to choke to lose the 3rd seed, like tonight
NBA Announcer::Tonight wasn't a Choke. If anything, Dallas almost choked by turning it over with 4 seconds left in the 4th and letting Denver tie the game.
NBA Announcer::I'll agree about Fournier getting more minutes, but let's not get carried away with our excitement over him. Very small sample size of work.
JustineS04::It'll be interesting to see how teams adjust to him if he continues to get minutes.
JustineS04::He has decent hands though.
vanpelt4prez::he'll turn it over driving to the hoop...wont get any love from officials being a 19 year old rookie too..  WhenKArl is using iggy at PG and Fournier at the 2...I like it...It would be nice to see Jham get some of that play too...both get lost on the perimeter and both can hit 3 balls
Viktor Karelin::Miller's famous last words: "That's a foul"
brian_millcreek::Everyone knows it by now. He said it 38 times that game
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::He was hacked 100 times but he played bad too..!!
brian_millcreek::I can only blame him.
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::You can't blame him tho since he was getting fouled but he should have made better decision too..!!
brian_millcreek::The definition of insane is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Kick the ball out.
JustineS04::I actually like Miller's game, when he plays his game and doesn't try to be Kobe.
vanpelt4prez::The worst game of the year for miller I think it was philly...when he kept trying to tie the game with 3 balls....i dont think one hit the rim
johnholmes6969::The sport of basketball ball just has to many flaws
JustineS04::Mostly just one. Bad officiating.
Michigan2013Champs::If Denver wins next 3 it doesn't matter what Memphis does.
cableboy764::So simple, yet hard to grasp for some...
NFLFanFreak::Who Supports Ty and Frenchy in the Point Guard Position next year.
vanpelt4prez::I dont think Fournier will be ready yet...Miller still has one more year left in him..but he has to be ok with not playing at end of games sometimes..and maybe only 20 minutes some games..diminished role   ELSE $@%! HIM
Young_Guruu::J-stone, Fournier is better at the shooting guard.
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::Jack and TY and Frenchy..!!
Peach Yagostein::Memphis plays  13th Lakers @ Memphis ......16-25 Lakers on the road  15th Memphis @ Dallas ........Memphis road &amp; Dallas home = 17th Utah @ Memphis ..........12-27 Utah on the Road -------------------------------- Memphis goes 3-0
NFLFanFreak::Fine Denver will go 2-1 as well. And still get the 3rd seed.
twosedinsnocup77::Doesn't matter, Nuggs go 3-0.
twosedinsnocup77::Neither will the Grizz.
leon sandcastles69::nuggets won't go 3-0
NFLFanFreak::Memphis are facing the Clippers not the Lakers
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::LOL Its Clippers not Lakers. You don't even know the schedule..!!
leon sandcastles69::leon sandcastles69 - twosedinsnocup77 - Dummy, if they go 2-1, and Nuggs go 3-0, Nuggs get it.  Even if both go 3-0, Nuggs get it by tiebreaker...  moron.  nuggets won't go 3-0 dummy, they'll lose to the bucks dummy  and they lose to blazers dummy, AI sucks.
leon sandcastles69::twosedinsnocup77 - Dummy, if they go 2-1, and Nuggs go 3-0, Nuggs get it.  Even if both go 3-0, Nuggs get it by tiebreaker...  moron.  nuggets won't go 3-0 dummy, they'll lose to the bucks dummy
twosedinsnocup77::Dummy, if they go 2-1, and Nuggs go 3-0, Nuggs get it.  Even if both go 3-0, Nuggs get it by tiebreaker...  moron.
leon sandcastles69::twosedinsnocup77 - Win what?  3rd seed dummy
NFLFanFreak::Not if Denver goes 3-0
twosedinsnocup77::Win what?
leon sandcastles69::doesn't matter, if memphis goes 2-1 they still win it
leon sandcastles69::yep
NBA Announcer::nope.
leon sandcastles69::nuggets lose 3rd seed.. b/c of AI..
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::Stop with the chemistry crap. Sign Jack and Korver next season..!!
johnselway::Alright nugget fans.....I'm out......see you sunday.....maybe....... Goin back to this house that is playing coachella in three different parts of it.....  If you all want to check it out you can on the link below....has the artists and stages.....TIMES ARE PST just fyi Later http://www.heyreverb.com/blog/2013/04/12/coachella-2013-live-stream/66487/#2
johnselway::,
vanpelt4prez::Karl doesn't mind Brewer with 20 shots attempts...its the fact that 15 of them weren't layup attempts that pisses him off
NBA Announcer::Corey isn't a pure jump shooter, so his off balance fade away jumpers that only hit the backboard are a tough to watch as a fan.
johnholmes6969::Im a grizzly fan and respect the nuggets and I got to say I saw some awful calls that went dallass way, im tired of the nba refs screwin games up even if it is in my favor. ...
Young_Guruu::I saw a lot of bad calls but it's been a long time since I've seen a call as bad as the one on Dirk. Unbelievably bad call.
NBA Announcer::Right! That call couldn't have come at a bigger point of the game.
cableboy764::Worst officials in all pro sports...
49ers2014SBChamps::<b>AHAHAHAHHAAAAAA</b>
vanpelt4prez::fournier is only ahead of mozgov in +/-
JustineS04::I think that's partially due to his garbage time minutes. He was in with the scrubs at the end of games until recently. He's really playing well now.
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::Deceiving stat..!!
vanpelt4prez::a little fournier has been playing good the last few games...but he has looked terrible at times too...he'd have worse turnovers than miller when the intensity is higher kid is only 19
Viktor Karelin::That performance proved why Miller belongs as a backup. Hope Ty gets the start Sunday.
NBA Announcer::Miller belongs in a rocking chair. Throwing Perfect Alley oop passes of crackers to the old folks for their soup.
Viktor Karelin::Not sure if slam on white people or old people but I'll agree.
