StevenK_3::Popped a molly I'm sweatin.
Sportssmh::The Heats biggest competition to stop them from reaching the finals is the 9th seed Sixers. If Bynum can come back and played  together he would throw around Bosh in a 1 vs 8th seed that coud be magic. Other than that Heat make easy finals run. Lets go Sixers!
Kelvs1751::Get off the pipe
YaImFromCleveland::We the Heat, we stack teams.  We Heat fans, we ride bandwagons
marsh025::here's a guy whose butt hasn't healed after 3 years.  don't worry. wait for him to come back in two years.  act like the natives in the south pacific building mock airplanes to lure thier "gods" back sure. he "needs" your forgiveness so he's coming back. Funny. I don't hear Akron complaining.

We both know the Heat wasnt trying::I hope Derrick Rose loses the lower half of his body in a car accident involving a teddy bear

ImAWitness06::Heat need to sign somebody
cbbaseball19::10 day contract
ImAWitness06::Heard Knicks were after him didnt know they signed him

duro.::peace!
Aicyla22::byeee
Aint Bout Dis Life Vol. II::stay pretty baby girl
ImAWitness06::Sadly Pittman won't be able to clothesline another benchwarmer that clowns LeBron
MiamiFan2004::Think about it.  One game without Pittman, and they were already attacking his knees.  Birdman should have made it clear that we ain't about that life, either.  Coward slunk away afterward, too, hiding behind Noah while LeBron worked out the pain.  Of course, the pro-Bulls refs called it a side out because LeBron was in too much pain to even heave up a shot after that.  The rest of the world knew it was a flagrant, since he didn't even TRY for the ball.
Aicyla22::thats a good thing
Aicyla22::we dont need anyone clotheslining anyone, thats trashy, a good old elbow to the face from UD is sufficient
KingLebriansKarateKid::i'm gonna run on the court and personally chop them
ImAWitness06::No that's a bad thing. Who is going to clothesline the next benchwarmer that clowns LeBron?
Aint Bout Dis Life Vol. II::you know when youre the first to comment on an article you say 'first!'  well i do the same when i c.um first when having sex......unfortunately im always done first :/

ImAWitness06::Stay classy Chicago
We both know the Heat wasnt trying::This injury has caused us to overrate Derrick Rose. He's the guy who gets shut down by LeBron in 4th quarters ,remember . You can't win a title with that crippled choker

cbbaseball19::Damn lebrian he tried the ish out of you!
Then He Made Us Pancakes.... Pancakes.::Ehhhhhh, Im so white.
YaImFromCleveland::Its not the Bulls organization fault that they can't get to the Finals.  Its because 3 players decided to cheat the system, and stack a team, in order to win.

scooterpants21::Crazy to see the level of defense by the Heat last night. They forced so many turn overs, shot clock violations and bad shots. Chicago's D is pretty mean too, clearly that's why they're the 5th seed cause they're offense is terrible.
Intellibeam15::Their best shooter doesn't even play and thats daequan cook

The Unemployed Mamba Legacy::The Clippers are still questionable.  OKC has lost some edge since James Harden left.  San Antonio Spurs is who the Heat need to lookout for.

Dane Kitazaki::Heat smash
Dane Kitazaki::U wont like it when theyre angry? lol
method305::Damn that was pretty good.
