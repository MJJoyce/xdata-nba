phils win phils win::Great win for the sixers. They showed that a lot of guys can step up at any given time, and that they'll be an extrememly scary team when (if) Bynum gets healthy.
buffalo-butt-breath::I  MISS  NICK  YOUNG -CLIPPER  FAN
rustyburg::Lavoy Allen played 21 minutes, scored 0 points, had 0 rebounds, 2 assists, and 1 personal foul.  What they hell  was he on the floor for?  How much is he making this year to do absolutely NOTHING in this game?  Ridiculous.  He should donate his game paycheck to a non profit charity!
phils win phils win::He's a promising young player who needs experience in these early season games if he's going to amount to anything. He isn't great, but he's certainly come a long way from #500.
jgillespie1210::No Kwame or Bynum, the Sixers really dont have any other option. He usually has decent games, he just had a bad one today.
Dwight Shrute Owns Dwight Howard::Future sixers lineup Pg: Jrue Sg: ET Sf: dorrell Pf: Thad young/Spence  C: bynum
East coaster 4 life::Nice win Sixers
sportscrazy45029::SWAGGY
jayshah96::lollol @ the second quarter
toronto-vigilante3::Simple:  1) Raps cannot play "D" for 4 quarters straight for the life of them.....  2) We're still a garbage rebounding team (weak players, scared to get their hands dirty)....  3) "Team" has no life on the court, as they do not play much of a team concept game = lack of assists   1 - 5....? Makes you wonder how we're not 0 - 6 with this bunch.
19brom::again, one terrible quarter $@%!$ the whole game up for us
bobHALO 30.6::Good win for the Sixers.  This could have been a letdown game coming off a good win in BOS.  Other than the 2nd quarter the Raptors played us tough!
IggyIsClutch::Gg
RapCity421::Derick Williams is a BUST!!!!!!
Leafsfankenny67::Could be a long season. Go Raptors
Chris Broussards source.::Don't worry Raptors the Wizards are having a slow start too.
Leafsfankenny67::Well I won't stop cheering for the Raptors but it could be a long
ISTIK2DaGCODE::KLEIZA -20 IN 12 MINS CUT THIS GUY FROM THE TEAM
ignasm::Lucas was the responsable, Kleiza didn't do anything wrong ... was just in at the wrong time

jdizzy86::lol damnnnn that blows
gri400::minor miracle that it was only a ten point game.  GG everyone. lowry can't come back soon enough :(
ma642332::good game
FlyGuys623::4-2. not too shabby
lilcrim21::And no Bynum?  Not too shabby at all.  I am liking the way this team is playying right now with no J. Rich and no Bynum.  I know its been done to death, but  if we can win without Bynum, just imagine this team's potential with a relatively healthy, talented, Center.
ISTIK2DaGCODE::NICE 2ND QUARTER RAPTORS, GOOD JOB BENCH U PLAYED LIKE ISH!
FlyGuys623::gg
Sh4k4zulu::23 rebounds turner 2 nights in a row

SB4LlFE::Craptors are such a joke
FlyGuys623::i remember when denver fans were saying lawson &gt; jrue
GrandmasBoyDawg858::I need a 3 ball from the raptors and and a foul from the traptors
.NYC IS THE BEST 68::Check
Sh4k4zulu::o snap 90's dance music haha
jgillespie1210::very easy stretch coming up for the sixers, they should be able to win 7-8 of the next 10.
lilcrim21::And in the meantime, Bynum will hopefully continue to make progress with those rickety knees of his.
FlyGuys623::good game for royal
Sh4k4zulu::his third steal :)
