donald::If the Celtics have to give up a 1st rounder and Bass or Green, to get Asik, they need to do it and quickly.  They've got a beast PF in Sullinger playing out of position at C, and Asik will give them the D they need to make it to the EC finals.
Rusty Shackleford::Nice job Wizards, games like this are great for building character and teaching the young players to never give up.
Mlyet::Wizards came out sleepwalking in the first quarter but finally got it together in time and have finished strong!
Daniel D::Lets go Celtics. You can beat this group.
patrick o::get rid of jeff green while you can get value for him...he is absolutely not a leader for the Celts....Nice story, but that does not make him a leader....nor does his lack of production when the team needs him the most....ala Bird, Mchale, Lewis, even Pierce
PKM::Jef Green 2 rebounds in 30 minutes not good
walktalk59::here comes sully now
Melissa::Gortat + Nene fg10-15   26 PTS + 19 REB + 7AST + 5BLK  nice!
Trace Mann::Man the Celts need some better players they have given up some huge leads the last few weeks!
FreakinObnoxiousGentile::I think Green is the only one that got the message "TANK" because the youngsters are playing for a championship. You got many 1s ,just get on and win 18 point lead and you lose to the Wizzes????
