Thomas::SUGGESTION: To Mike Brown.  Nice game Cavs.  Sort of out energized poor Denver. But coach find at least 2 or 3 minutes of playing time for the rookie.  As a coach I'd have given Bennett a few minutes somehow.  Bennett should be given a clip board the rest of game. He is a expensive investment.   Relax fans. Let him digest what it takes. He will be o.k. once he matures a bit. He has the goods but is just overwhelmed in his first exposure to the style and speed of the big league play.  He'll catch up.   The rest of the team is showing time signs of meshing and growing which is a good thing.  Keep improving and get that confidence up to beat anyone. Even Miami.
