Texicano10::Heat fan must be scared if he came to the spurs board to talk trash, heat will lose tonight vs Memphis
152Dean::spurs win without tp...wow
lsiberian::Pop is definitely coaching them up.
rp3thax::It is a crying shame that the Lakers can win more titles in 12 years than teams who have been around for 40 years.  And even if you say the Lakers buy championships, last time I checked, you have to win on the court.  The championship trophy is not given to the highest bidder.
Texicano10::Dam you Neal why didn't you play like that in the WCF!!!!!!
rp3thax::Plenty of NBA players play well in the regular season and do $@%! in the playoffs.
Texicano10::But he was good in all the other series he just sucked so bad vs okc
CandySparker::Cheers Neal Diamond
rollinoverthetide1968::I started playing an online bet system called Sportsbettingstar. Since I started I have made an average profit of $3,000 a month. I hope that this reaches someone that is looking for an online betting system that really works well. I found this system on the 1st page of Google by searching the  words Sports Betting System.
CBass1317::line was -2.5.  Refs trying their damnest to make sure Spurs cover.  Batum almost blew it for them.
gt1master_ike::So Batum has his best game Ever, ALdridge goes for 29, Lillard has his usual 20, And Hickson has a 15 rebound double double and the Blazers still lose to the Spurs at home.......without Tony Parker.  Ok then.
LeoA86::Tim. nuff said
p1kaygee::Its becuz the blazers bench has no depth past nolan smith, and luke babbit
CBass1317::Smith and Babbit are both terrible.

redevelopmentguy::Yep.  The same way Kobe backdoored that b..itch in Colorado.
redevelopmentguy::slam_dunk_on_u needs to be banned from posting here.  His ignorance is reaching epidemic levels and may cause unwarranted harm on the rest of us.
No-account drifter::Unless you just ignore him?
AustinBeal::It's impossible to ignore him and his big dumbo eared, mentally disabled self
SPURZWARZ1.0::Thunder &amp; laker excuses:  Could have, should have, &amp; would have!
rp3thax::Why don't you shut up until your team wins back to back titles.  The Spurs are the kings of, one and done.  What have you guys won since 2007.  The Lakers have won more titles in the last 12 years than the Spurs have won in their 40 years of existence.
Shoobie4777::Tony Parker isn't even a top 10 pointguard.
Kkeet26::name 10 better than him

CandySparker::Manu is the man.
phil0323::but tonight it was all neal and duncan
phil0323::Lakers beat Detroit yesterday and everyones getting excited LOL  0-7 c'mon
slam_dunk_on_u::For all thse spurts fans who hate on the Lakers let me tell you that  they  were playing bad on purpouse to get Mike Brown fired from his coaching position and open the doors for the return of Phil Jackson!!!  Watch out NBA is now time to show a real contender...the spurts and Thunder and of course the Bulls are a bunch of pretenders!!
hookem731::You're the trolliest cun-tiest c-unt that ever trolled. I hate you.
June 24th Is Kobe Bryant Day::Omg, troll logic is soooo stupid.
redevelopmentguy::Sure.    Okay, why did they intentionally tank meaningless preseason games.  Stop the excuses and BS you $@%!$@ up Laker fan.

phil0323::okc beat spurs last year cause of refs everyone knows it.......the refs favored heat so they didn't call the flops on harden so heat won
Prometheus Guns::I still believe this myself. Stern got his wish on his finals series.
June 24th Is Kobe Bryant Day::The flop by Westbrook.  The phantom call on Timmy.  OMG there were about a dozen horrible calls.  There goes my blood pressure...
June 24th Is Kobe Bryant Day::The tech on SJax for talking back to Mo Cheeks.  Worst playoff Tech ever.

SPURZWARZ1.0::D Rose is injured so often he collect workman's comp!
Shoobie4777::What happens after Tim Duncan retires?
Shoobie4777::No. A disgruntled Popovich will try and implement a Princeton office then get fired after 5 games, because without Tim Duncan the Spurs are a lottery team.
Racketyplum::and your basing this on?
Damasta959::the world explodes due to a lack of fundamentals
Racketyplum::Goes down as the greatest PF of all time.

CamOverRG3::It was nice watching Rose use his signature tear drop over Tim Duncan to clinch the game last season
Racketyplum::D rose will come back half as good as he was at best. Wont wanna test his knee.
Racketyplum::Spurs are still competing, the Bull are back to lottery picks.
SPURZWARZ1.0::The tear drop was from your girlfriend
CamOverRG3::A hobbled Derrick Rose schooled TP9 last season in SA, I know that
Racketyplum::enjoy it while it last.
SPURZWARZ1.0::Schooled like your mom!
SPURZWARZ1.0::D Rose is always injured. Frail as a butterfly!
