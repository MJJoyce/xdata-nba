tmoneyinmphs::blah
ritchieritch47::This is a turning point loss in my opinion. If the Dubs rebound back to their winning ways then they'll be dangerous in the playoffs. If not then they may slide all the way out of the playoff picture. Like I said my opinion. :-)
Oaktown1029::it's only 1 game against a great team whose playing on their home court and have an axe to grind since losing the first two games to the Dubs - relax.
everyones-sleepin-on-the-clippers::i'm  a  huge  clipper  fan,but  with out  cp3's  leadership,clippers  wouldn't of  ever  broke  a  12 game  wining  streak  or  a 12 home home  winning  streak,this  guy is the  heart and  soul  of  this  team,giving  everyone  a  chance  especially  willy  green  and  being  unselfish,how  can  this  guy  not  be  mvp?changing  the image  of  the  clippers looking  sharp and  dominant  like  the  globetrotters,i  hope  he  stays  here  in  LA,and  he  tells carmelo  anthony  tht  his  succes  here  is  more  important then  playing buddy  budys
BarrelRider04::Such a good point! I mean anyone that could come in and totally turn around this historically disgraceful Clipper franchise should be instantly crowned MVP.
JoeClipplet::Great win SHOWTIME!!  Dominating message sent and received   - jc
SCAngelsTrojansClippersKings49ers::Clipps clowned the Warriors. That was embarrassing
BarrelRider04::Indeed, complete reversal clowning from Wednesday when we got clowned.  It's comedy how this thread is just completely devoid of W fans who must be still shell shocked over that complete destruction of their team. A lot of W fans were talking mad smack before yesterdays game they were going to slam us 3 in a row.
BarrelRider04::derek_510 - how about you consider the time zones?  it was a saturday night, a lot of warrior fans, such as myself, shut the laptop off around 9-10 west coast time.  and most, unlike myself, would not come back to a thread where our team lost by 20+...don't see much comedy in that.  Yeah, I'm West coast to barno. Your last sentence makes more sense. But when you guys crushed us I came on and tipped my hat to you and congratulated your team. Guess you guys don't have any respect.

leedogg77::Some people have been ripping Odom, but he's played his role well. He is averaging more rebounds per minute than anyone else on the team. Goes without saying that Crawford has been huge.
Megatron818::They rip him more so cause of his wife, and maybe cause of the way he played in Dallas last year.
BarrelRider04::Maybe because of the way he played in Dallas last year? MAYBE? No, MOST DEFINITELY because of the way he played in Dallas last year and NO DOUBT FOR SURE because of his wife. But it is good news he is looking much better than the lump of poo that he looked like at the beginning of the season.
BarrelRider04::When Bledsoe blocked the living hel out of Jack at the end of the game and sent all the Warriors immediately off the court with their heads down looking like zombies and their tales between their legs....that was a STATEMENT!
BarrelRider04::Wow, what a tale of two games from Wednesday - this time Lee and Curry come out and have stinkers and Paul and Griffin dominate. W fans were hoping for a third straight win but the Clippers made a very strong statement and completely dismantled the W's in every facet of the game.
ivjo31::dang i love how mark Jackson staring at their bench, Warriors need a boss like this!
Clipper Ian::SLAAAAAAAM DUUUUNK!!!  Ralph Lawler
JohnDoe5334::It looked like he wanted to cry "you can't do that to us!" Haaahaaahaaa....  I wonder how E would describe this BLOW OUT in NBA2K13??
Theironrod2012::I dont think chris paul should get mvp. I would rather it be MELO. Chris Paul has a lot of players on his team and Jamal Crawford being one of my favorite players ever. Chris Paul stats doesn't say mvp to me. They team is doing great though .
JohnDoe5334::Clips without CP3 would be the Warriors with high fliers (nice to watch but no threat) NY without Melo would be like... NY with Melo, no difference (no chance of championship).  Knicks MVP is Chandler (Cali) hands down, without him they would be the nuggets of the east...
GASC72::theironrod, good thing your non analyzing the  game axx isnt voting
Resident_Guido::CP3's stats aren't strong because the Clips blow everyone out and he ends up sitting the entire 4th quarter... he barely plays. His leadership is what makes him the MVP -- that and the way his team is winning.
airic.ad::CP3 has many intangibles though.  Crawford's resurgence is in a large part because of CP3.
Asif11111::KD &gt; alles
dwade grater den jordan 5.0::clips will be better den lakers 4 awile  just my 2 sense tho
dallas1234567891098::clippers................best team in the NBA right now!
ilenedoveradolfoliverbush::Clips are off the hook right now...sounds trollish, but seriously I'm sure a huge percentage of you fans are bandwagon jumpers. It's one thing to rep your city, but dumping on the lakers all the sudden?
dane123646::Why?  Laker fans dumped on the Clips for years for one reason--because they sucked and they deserved it.   True, the Lakers don't suck as much as the Clips did, but given their payroll and their press, why not dump on them?   It is, after all, a sport.
LA Clipp Joint::Statement win for us tonight especially after trumping the @ss clowns from across the hallway
CBass1317::27 points on 12 shots, 9 asts, 5 rbs and no TOs all in just 28 minutes.  Maybe the most flawless game of the young season.  Pretty impressive.
Maximillian_1::And no fouls, CP3 on fire
mksatx::Clips deserve all the credit they get. Watching them beat laker was nice.  Cp is the man.  No kiddin
underpiker::This is what happens when u win a regular season home game and celebrate like if it was the finals game 7, good riddance go clips
bballfan6767::How's Harrison Barnes been? Is he the player who showed flashes of brilliance in all 5 Duke games, the end of his freshmen year, and middle of Sophomore? Or is he the guy I remember letting everyone down during the ACC and NCAA tourneys at the end of last year?
Phocatiser::He stole 2 wins by himself against Kobe's Laker team a fewer years back,  Now hee's now stolen Kobe's own own home court,  Chris Paul. Number 1 point guard in the league. Period
Gimme the damn ball::Clippers dominated the Warriors.  What more can I say.
big18brad::pEOPLE DONT REAILIZE THE CLIPPERS SUCK
Cleeepers::pEOPLE DONT REAILIZE THE CLIPPERS SUCK... the life out of every team's game with their smothering defense, and that's why they will win it all.  #Madlibs
