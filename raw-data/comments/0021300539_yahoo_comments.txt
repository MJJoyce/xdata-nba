GB::I've always had a lot of respect for Deng.  I can't believe we were able to get an all-star in his prime for essentially nothing (since Bynum wasn't playing).
CrushJenkins::Look for Miles and Waiters to thrive b/c they will draw the worst defender and only 1 of them can start so the other will play vs. non-starters and be the first option with the 2nd team.
Curtis::Cleveland will make it to the playoffs this year and  will give the Miami Heat a run for their money.  The Utah Jazz have five great lottery players on their team and they are starting to mesh well together these last 20 games. They will not make the playoffs this year, however, the Jazz will be tough next year and will give the Thunder a run for their money. I predict the Jazz will win tonight by 3. Good luck to both teams.
The Question::I think when they drafted Waiters the idea was he was going to be similar to James Harden. I mean he was an outstanding 6th man in college,but his career stats are lousy. It's like he hasn't worked at his game at all. 41% FG,2 to 2 t/o to ast ratio,I'm all for developing a guy but unless he stops believing he's 1st team talent and works to become the talent,he sucks.
Yao::Back-to-back blowout victories for the Cavs. Maybe Bynum was the problem. Let's keep it going!!
Roy::I bet Deng dont know how to act only playing 21 minutes. THats half of his normal playing time at Chicago.
jlpamc::Brown just put Bennett on the court and took #$%$.
Rick::The Spazz keep up their "loser" tradition ! The whole organization is a joke !
Chris::Why hasn't Hayward played in this game?
Anton::I think Cavs have found their groove. Look out Miami and Indiana.
