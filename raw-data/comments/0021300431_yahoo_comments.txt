Tony Anthony::Why does Wittman insist on playing his terrible bench? They always lose any momentum the Wizards have.
Dan::Whoa, Rubio actually scored in double digits? Nice win Wolves.
Gatorb8t::Man the Zards were totally flat, that's their worst effort of the year...................
Peter::Give the ball to johnny wall. He can score 50 points. Problem is, the rest of the team can't do squat.
David::THE N.B.A REALY IS FANTASTIC
derek b::Kevin Love better come to the LAkers. I want him to be our franchise after Kobe is gone.
J::Go T-Wolves!
Anton::What a weak game. Both teams belong in the D-league, maybe even F-league.
none::This team is rebuilding and will always be re-building.
Tony Anthony::BOX OUT GORTAT!!
