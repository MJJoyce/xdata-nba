yousername::awfully quiet in here..just so you know the magic could beat the lakers and anyone not named the spurs or thunder in the west. in the east the magic could get up for the bulls if they had the time of their lives and could beat the heat for the fact that they cant contain any post presence
nahhb::nba draft, all nba players are eligible where would u guys put irving? this site had him 18th, seemed too low http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Hey, we have 5 picks in this year's draft, WATCH out next year when Kyrie is 20 and Trisitan is 22. They will both drop 20+ points a game.
poodagg::i will take that bet!
markos kolioulis::so cleveland you taking gilchrist if you get a top 5 pick?
JDunifon3::If he falls that far, it would be a great snag.  I'm thinking Brad Beal would be a great back court addition
sburgess3366::The Luke Walton era in cleveland has begun
jtyree0226::WOW Wait a minute Luke Walton steped on the court for 3minutes and got a steal?
KingGeorge53::LOL   I missed the game and thought the same thing when I saw that stat.
mikeyp2307::Cleveland! people know how good the cavs are gonna be a few years down the line. They are scared! Getting all their cheapshots in now.
shartmaster69::lmao yeah because dan gilbert has done such a great job!  irving is gone in four years, they have had ONE good draft pick since gilbert bought the team, and there is no above average free agent willing to play for this classless man!
mikeyp2307::ur an idiot. what you said was not facts. its ur own stupid opinion
shartmaster69::lol all facts except possibly irving leaving.  you cant give me any indication your puppet master is going to do any better!
KingGeorge53::Love a good flagging material post like this ^
KingGeorge53::Missed the game tonight.   Was watching Ohio U.  One step closer to a ping pong ball baby!
KingGeorge53::and BTW, Harrison Barnes did not impress me at all.    Let's go with another 3 in the draft please.
yata9arasu::HECK YEAH!!!  GO CAVS!!!!!!!!!!!!
quickbr0wnf0x::What's with the odd Magic fan taunting that Kyrie Irving will be leaving in 6 years, when just days ago you were sweating buckets about Dwight Howard leaving?   And ripping on Byron Scott, when you have Stan Van Gundy?  Let's focus on the game, folks, not trying to make ourselves feel superior by baseless putdowns of the other team's players and fans.
_MagiCanes_::You mean SVG who has been to the finals and two ecf and is in top 5 in wins since he joined ORL? Try again moron.
Emmannuel1220::Orlandonio Spagic.
Ray Allen Fan91::It always Cavs fans left on here win or loss nice
dsg1319::....
BranchJustinians::Go Cavs!
Frenchyboy9::Audi TT is balling!
CavsFan86::Happy B-Day Kyrie! Go Cavs!
Mr. Mojorising::Dont worry, Cavs fans...I'm leaving...not worth my time to stay here and teach you about how bad you suck. Just watch your games and maybe one day...you'll wake up and realize it. And by the time you think things will turn around....Irving will be leaving after his rookie contract runs out. .....ouch!
cland4ever::are you that stupid your comparing a lebron that was 5 6 seasons in the nba to a rookie pg.
Mr. Mojorising::Are Cavs fans so stupid...they are really gonna compare Lebrons record in Cleveland and what Irving will do? LOL! That is funny..............
BranchJustinians::You do realize that the Magic are like a 3rd tier team, right?  Atlanta and Orlando are the 2 teams everyone knows will make the playoffs and go no where.
cland4ever::lebron missed playoffs to his rookie season dumbass
poodagg::its too $@%!$@%!
Mr. Mojorising::Big difference, Cavs fans. Lebron was winning you guys 60 games a year and deep playoff runs. Irving is gonna see 20 and 30 win seasons and no playoffs. He is outta there when his rookie contract is up...count on it unless you get a coach.
yata9arasu::Yes it was all James.  Explains why he is win 60+ with the Heat (James + Wade+ Bosh=50 something wins, but by himself 60+ twice).....  Makes sense......  The Cavs are almost in the playoffs this year.  You are badly mistaken if you think Irving + TT + Whoever we draft this year + Varejao+ Gee won't get us in the playoffs.
BranchJustinians::You mean they've been playing without a coach this whole time?!
yata9arasu::James, West, Shaq, Z, New Coach, Brown leaving, D-leaguers playing=19-63.
poodagg::west left the year before, shaq had nothing left as well as z, and if you think brown is a good coach you are flat out ignorant!
BMS092::So what if he leaves? Its not like in 6 years we'll be totally dependent on him. Lebron leaving = 19-63. Kyrie leaving in 6 years = 41-41 at worst.
yata9arasu::LOL!  HE PROBABLY WON'T LEAVE FOR AT LEAST 6 YEARS!
CLEVELANDCBI::TT is starting to show real signs of improvement, and Gee has a future t too.  Throw in Irving and AV (and the player/picks teams would give for him) and I like our future.  Good game Magic fans, and I hope Howard wises up and re-signs with you.
KENNY-----------POWERS::your going to want to hang onto Irving...
openminded43::TRADE YA PG'S???
yata9arasu::Good game Magic!  Good luck in the future!  TAKE DOWN THE HEAT!!!  :)  GO CAVS!!!
openminded43::Since the Magic have played 3 or 4 games more than many other teams, shouldn't this schedule start to THIN OUT???
rockndoc2::I see there are now some idiots here.  Well, nice game Magic.  Later.  and for the IDIOTS?  too bad for you, you dont even know who you are.  Bye!
dhbhdbhcbh::MAGIC IS FULL OF LAZY NIGGGGGERS,FOR 3MINS THEY COULDNT SCORE A $@%!$@% BASKET ARE YOU $@%!$@% SERIOUS??????
ctowngambler78::Don't bet fool!!! Go to work, you will always win.......
openminded43::U MAD BRO???
Mr. Mojorising::17-28...Cavs fans must be so proud of Byron Scott and the Cavs progress this year.
KENNY-----------POWERS::from what they were...in a year or two they have a good chance at the playoffs...considering BOS is coming back down..
Mr. Mojorising::This is why I love Cleveland sports fans...they are so pathetic..they think a guy like Byron Scott is a winner.
yata9arasu::Yeah I am....  This team lost 26 GAMES IN A ROW!  THEY ARE LIGHTYEARS AHEAD!  THEY ARE 2 GAMES OUT OF THE PLAYOFFS COMING INTO TODAY!  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT???  IF VAREJAO DOESN'T GET HURT THEY ARE A 7 OR 8 SEED!
CLEVELANDCBI::Mr. Homorising, You're neither amusing or even annoying.  Just be quiet.
Not A Racist::Magic are too dependent on the 3, which is why they will never win the Championship until that changes.
openminded43::ALL teams are DEPENDENT on something!!!
CLEVELANDCBI::I think so too.  They're tough every year though.
yata9arasu::Cavs had 19 wins last year they have 17 now.........
yata9arasu::YEAH BUT THAT WAS A WHOLE SEASON!
Mr. Mojorising::What an improvement.
Not A Racist::Its a shortened season that isn't over yet so it kind of is.
Mr. Mojorising::At this pace Byron Scott will be 72-182 after 250+ games as the Cavs coach. Congrats Cleveland on a great hire.
BMS092::At this pace, you will make me mentally $@%!$@%! at how many ignorant posts you make. Congrats moron.  From the City of Cleveland.
MagicBoltzRays::Three Stars 1. Hedo 2. Howard 3. Nelson
yata9arasu::Byron Scott took a team with 26 wins to the NBA FINALS TWO YEARS IN A ROW!!!  HE TOOK THE HORNETS FROM A 18 WIN TEAM TO A 56 WIN TEAM WHO HAD THE BEST RECORD IN THE WEST!  WHAT THE $@%! ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?????  GIVE HIM TIME!  IF IN 2 YEARS THE CAVS ARE STILL WINNING LESS THAN 20 GAMES THEN YOU CAN TALK BUT COME ON!!!
111Mauricejonesdrew111::daniel orton siting
openminded43::Stan should run plays with this GARBAGE unit!!! WORK ON IT IN PRACTICE!!!
dhbhdbhcbh::$@%! YOU MAGICS YOU $@%!$@% BUMS
rockndoc2::BTW........i WAS AT THE Q for lukes first game.  My Free Scouting report: Luke Walton SF: PRO's;:  Quick and solid with fist bumps on players coming off court ................light clapping on made free throws a plus ................active arould time out huddle CONS:    Not a towel waver during comeback runs .................Half-hearted with rump-slaps
tampasportsrule::Magic fans which team in the East would you least like to face in the first round ?
openminded43::Pistons!!!
MagicBoltzRays::Ohio making a comeback vs. UNC. hahaha
tampasportsrule::I think it is safe to say that Luke won't get a ring this year for being a spectator.
dhbhdbhcbh::DID THE MAGICS SCORE OVER 30???? SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME???
kkjr14::its magic singular
ctowngambler78::No only 21pts....
rockndoc2::LUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUKE
yata9arasu::LUKE WALTON IS IN THE GAME!!!!!!!!  HERE COMES THE COMEBACK!!!!!!!!
openminded43::Let's THANK the PISTONS for their AMAZING "EFFORT" tonight!!!
openminded43::We KNOW who they SAVE their BEST EFFORTS FOR!!!
Mr. Mojorising::How about that Byron Scott? He is about to be 36-91 as the Cavs coach. At what point do Cleveland fans finally admit the guy sucks and quit making excuses for him?
BMS092::Oh, I'm sure that everyone laughs at Cleveland because of Byron. Ever realize that 63 of those losses came with probably the worst team in NBA history? We had LeBron leave like the coward he is, and we actually did something smart, got Irving. And we stick by losers? The Browns fire every coach that sucks after 2-3 years, yes the Browns still suck, but thats a GM fault. Indians? Dont get me started on the Dolans pockets, thinner than yours.
Mr. Mojorising::This is why everyone laughs at Cleveland as a whole. Their fans are idiots and stick by losers like Byron Scott.
Mr. Mojorising::No coach should keep their job when they are 36-91...I dont care who is on the team. And win you have Jamison averaging 20 and the #1 pick and the draft and you still cant win....your coach sucks. Plain and simple.
rockndoc2::When did you become clueless?  Or were you born that way?
MagicBoltzRays::the cavs have no young talent on their roster besides Irving, and maybe Thompson
BMS092::We need a SG and a C badly...
BMS092::Gee, TT, Irving, Samuels, Harris, Sloan, Gibson. All 26 and under.
ctowngambler78::Cavs have 4 picks in the top 40 this year too...
rockndoc2::Gee, TT, Irving.
ctowngambler78::Stay off the drugs.....
dhbhdbhcbh::I NEED MAGICS TO 31 THIS QT COME ON BOYS!!!!!!!!!!!
dhbhdbhcbh::IS THE GAME OVER???
tampasportsrule::It's not over. But it's over.
tampasportsrule::Best starting 5 in MLB ? TB Rays. Next.
111Mauricejonesdrew111::i didnt know the mlb had a starting 5 i thought it was a starting 9
tampasportsrule::That would be pitchers Mr. Jones Drew. Btw you all will regret not acquiring Timmy.
MagicBoltzRays::shut up. you're going to jinx them
111Mauricejonesdrew111::even though im a magic fan the australian assassin is a baller and will average over 20 and 8 next year and hes already the best duke pro player ever
tampasportsrule::The truth ? Magic could have won this game by 35 points tonight if they kept playing with any interest and aggressiveness for longer stretches.
openminded43::They had plenty in the gas tank since they didn't USE ANY the first three qtrs!!!
yata9arasu::LOL!!!!  THE KNICKS WERE ON A ROLL THEN THEY LOSE TO THE RAPTORS!!!  LOL!
Masta_ Da Magician::I guess I'm just not a big Dwight fan anymore..I think I had already mentally prepared myself that he was gone and when he flip flopped I didn't know what to think..Now I just bash him..LOL
dhbhdbhcbh::FCUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK ORL WONT SCORE OVER 31 THIS FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK I HATE THIS TEAM THEY ARE FUCKKKING CURSED
rockndoc2::Speaking of Sessions, IMO David Stern will reward the Cavs for saving the Lakers season and give us a top three pick.   Kidd G or Barnes would work
yata9arasu::MAYBE EVEN #1................  :D
rockndoc2::Magic had b2b 1's back in  the day
yata9arasu::-_-  Of course you'll bring him in with 5 min left........
yata9arasu::No Irving in the 4th=Tanking........  :D
i liked this comment::i must admit i have watched a few lakers games recently and Sessions seems to be a fan favorite already.............
yata9arasu::YEAH HE IS THE NEXT MAGIC JOHNSON!!!!!!!
