raidertatonmyarmversion2::stephen a smith is going crazy on skip
raidertatonmyarmversion2::jimmy butlers defense and his offense against wade and rips running around before and after jimmy wade wont last a tough 6 7 game series so bulls need to grind them the hell out and they could beat the heat man from what ive seen this year ive watched a lot of heat games ive watched all the bulls games i gotta say bulls gets rose back to normal rose yea i got bulls in 6 7
mroe2986::Time to start jimmy over rip
raidertatonmyarmversion2::time to pull rip out faster after 5 minuets i likes rip O when he gets it going fast i dont want rip coming in for butler thats bad when u have butler coming in ur bench is as good as ur starting 5 if not better thats always better thats why harden started jimmy could be our harden lolll different game of course
patmandewb::The Bulls are a great cast of characters, but my 2 favorites are Gnarly Nate the Great and Jumpin' Jimmy Buckets! Gotta love Joltin' Joakim and Carlos the Crusher too!!
raidertatonmyarmversion2::i like them
parafal::are these their WWE names?
DatGuy8921::Yes.
parafal::Jimmy Butler is becoming the player we were waiting for Ronnie Brewer to become!
raidertatonmyarmversion2::thats painfully correct sir
DaRealDaBuu::Thibs has officially started trolling us when it comes to Derrick.
AdamSaidThis::Jimmy looks to be a upgrade over Ronnie Brewer. Younger, cheaper and with a wider array of offensive moves while maintaining the high effort D that Brewer gave us.  I also like our acquisition of Nate Robinson. He seems more like a significant upgrade over JL3. Where we have lost is backup center of course. Asik was quite the luxury to have. Having Taj play backup center is a bandaid solution. Taj can score at the 5...but he cannot defend as well as Asik can at the 5. Noah having a strong year is really helping to mask this issue. Gawd forbid he goes down...we'd be screwed.   Not a fan of Bellineli &lt;-- sp? I think he gets a little too "black hole-ish" when given the ball. Hinrich is a nice addition. I'd rather have a saavy vet there than our revolving door of pg backups that we've had in the past.   All in all...this bench seems as good as the "bench mob" That's pretty darn good considering we have a lot of budget conscious pieces in there.
parafal::when MB is hot ride him... when he is not sit him
Worldwide Leader in Sports::belanelli makes clutch shots. why you would dump him is beyond me.
imagine606::I agreed with everything except for Belinelli. Marco's a scorer, but he is a 2 guard. However, the guy is actually a pretty good passer.
soxmandan90::Imagine what Jimmy Buckets will be like in a year or two if he keeps improving like he has. Rose will definitely push him to become better. After last year's horrible playoffs, things are starting to look bright for the Bulls future!
Paul Gliori::Jimmy Butler should win Most improved player this year
Jaguarcrazyboy::Great win by the Bulls.  The pairing of Deng/Butler really works.  Butler isn't a great scoring threat yet but when he does he can be the missing SG CHI is searching for. Things are really coming together and only will get better!
LetsPlayScRyB::Noah is Garbage
JordanFadeAway::13pts,18reb,7ast,5blk.1stl....what were you saying?
J. Voorhees::You want your mouth full of garbage?
IAMpunter0926::why? why? why why why? be more constructive with your feedback
BORICUBA773::I. Gotta say I like this bulls squad better and better every game from nate to Jimmy. I think we have a scary team when rose comes back
kudjer1::motherf*ckin Jimmy Buckets
Hines Ward Zombie::brains....
LeCroissantMD::Jimmy Boy has been ballin' all year!
JordanFadeAway::JIMMY BUCKETS!
pshores1968::betting with an online system called Sportsbettingstar for a few months. I have made over $3,000 a month now for three straight months since I started following it. This system was on the very first page of Google when I searched for  Sports Betting Systems. It is extremely popular and if you have not heard of this system I highly recommend it.
steffinity89@gmail.com::But if we have heard of the system then you don't recommend it?
pshores1968::using this bet system a few months back called Sportsbettingstar. In my first month of using this system I made almost  $3,000 profit.  If you like to bet sports I recommend this system to anyone that is tired of not winning your sports bets. You can find this system on the 1st page of Google if you search the term Sports Betting Systems.
SecondaryTy::You know what would be sweet and a (somewhat) possibility?  Jimmy Butler for 6th man of the year.
imagine606::Maybe in a couple of years, right now it's very difficult to win that without being an offensive player with big numbers.
Paul Gliori::I think J.R. Smith or Jamal Crawford might have that locked up
kweki17::I can see Butler moving up to SG and play with deng together on the floor. If Rip can come off the bench and still play quality minutes
erivera723::So excited about Rose coming back but at the same time I worried about him playing ESPECIALLY Miami cause we all know Wade has a tendency to injure players off borderline dirty plays.
DaRealDaBuu::If DWade ever wants to step foot back in Chicago, he should know better not to do anything like that. He'd have the whole city on his $@%!.
FrancoNero007::so are the bulls
gimmedahotsaucefunk::wade's a punk, if he tries anything on Derrick, we got robinson butler noah to teach him some manners
perez-matt::Robinson lol.......
LetsPlayScRyB::noah is garbage
gimmedahotsaucefunk::among others
sirclancolot44::The young man stands on the edge of his porch,  The days were short and the father was gone,  There was no one in the town and no one in the field,  This dusty barren land had given all it could yield.   I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen,  And I have no idea where else my heart could have been,  I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill,  And now I am sure my heart can never be still,  So collect your courage and collect your horse,  And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse.   Seal my heart and break my pride,  I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide,  Align my heart, my body, my mind,  To face what I've done and do my time.   Well you are my accuser, now look in my face,  Your opression reeks of your greed and disgrace,  So one man has and another has not,  How can you love what it is you have got,  When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?  Liars and thieves you know not what is in store.   There will come a time I will look in your eye,  You will pray to the God that you always denied,  The I'll go out back and I'll get my gun,  I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son".   Seal my heart and break my pride,  I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide,  Align my heart, my body, my mind,  To face what I've done and do my time.   Seal my heart and break my pride,  I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide,  Align my heart, my body, my mind,  To face what I've done and do my time.   Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me,  I know what I've done, cause I know what I've seen,  I went out back and I got my gun,  I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son".

Irish Gator::Good win, Bulls! I like seeing Nate Robinson out there so pumped up.  It's exciting watching a player like him. Anyways... On to the next one.  Go Bulls! :)
NBA_Highlights_23::I love Nate but, man once he gets caught up in the moment he takes some very bad shots sometimes. He needs to work on stopping the TO he forces. Otherwise, i enjoy him making those 3 PT's from Capn Kirk. Can't wait for the Next game. Da Bulls
DaRealDaBuu::There is a thin line between Super Nate and Dumb Nate. The fun is watching how he straddles it.
ArticSquarecle::Lol I wonder what happened to that Bobcat fan that was talking mad s.hit before the game .
Neil826::still doesnt make up for the embarrassing loss to them earlier this year.
JordanFadeAway::they won tonight all that matters
FranklinStrut::Exactly
FranklinStrut::Are you from Indiana or Miami?
23Mister::Good game butler!
Venomngw::The Bulls need to wax these chump teams.
imagine606::Agree entirely, they've lost to too many bad teams this season. I know it can be hard to get up to play some of those teams, but you need to win those games.
sirclancolot44::Jimmy Butler...what a beast
NBA_Highlights_23::Where's my poster machine Mr. Funk?!?
Bumslayer86::He's turning into a solid player.. paxson actually did something right by drafting him
imagine606::Say what you want about some of Pax's moves, but he's drafted very well. Rose was a no-brainer (despite some wanting Supercool Beas), but Taj and Butler have turned out to be excellent picks, both being picked late in the draft. The jury is obviously still out on Teague, but he can turn into a good point guard himself, and I'd love to see him as Rose's future backup, a backup you can feel comfortable putting in there for a good amount of time.
Bumslayer86::Yea it looks like he's headed in the right direction it's great to see .. his defense is  suffocating
NBA_Highlights_23::especially the defense he brings to the team, this kid is gonna be very reliable and key for the Bulls years to come. As long as he learns under the Thibs system, he will be very succesfull pulling up some good numbers.
StopHatingOnTheBullsThereTheBestInTheNBA::DID THE BULLS WIN
J. Voorhees::LetsPlay isn't too bright. Lol
pumpkinsfan460::Love it when fans have poor grammar in their usernames.
imagine606::I think he's talking about the use of "there" instead of "they're", something I was able to have down by the end of 2nd grade.
LetsPlayScRyB::whats wrong with his username?
FranklinStrut::'
NBA_Highlights_23::Nah they just finished visiting Obama in the white house, after winning their 3rd straight championship.
RZA_CONSOLE::jeff adrian was the top performer - there's your problem right there
Bumslayer86::lol
Bumslayer86::Tough road trip coming up for the Bulls hope they can split the 6
TecmoTrojan::WTF is up with booz? He has laid some serious eggs lately.
kensuave90::Maybe his strong play was to make a push for the all-star game and after the reserve picks went to Deng and Noah he's lost desire to play hard.
Bumslayer86::back to his old self
