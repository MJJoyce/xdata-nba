nasdii52::For those who watched the game and have basketball knowledge know that this game is fools gold and the Magic's finals game is during the regular season against the Heat.  They clearly cared more about that game than the Heat.  Look at the box score and think about if you think certain players will be able to put up those statistics over a 7 game series.  Dwight Howard is not going to be able to play basically 48 minutes a game in order to beat the Heat.
Chris31708::Actually they can pull it off, the Heat have just the Big 3 and no one else,  the Magic are clearly the better "team", even if they don't show it all of the time.
Christian2172::You have problems
MRArtman2u::yes he is actually, and the magic are 4-3 vs the heats big 3. so maybe its the heat who cant hang
Erik.Miller::Watch out! If Orlando stick with Dwight they are looking like they're going back to the finals!
mrhandy25::Please, you must be joking!

World Champs t y Dirk::Lebron James - King of D. Wades N   U    T   S   A   C   K    !!!!!!
Michael38061::That makes LBJ the alpha male
Michael38061::Lebron James - King of the NBA
ZachC1965::I get the feeling that LeBron never wrote back to Shub2308...
Shub2308::Zachary come on now you know better
Shub2308::My wife bought me the first Lebron shoes ever and I never set my feet in them.  Just collecting dust size 11.5 any want them?
mjsanders::With each sidekick performance, it still amazes me how people can seriously say that LBJ is far &amp; away the MVP this yr!  To put it as simply as possible, LBJ is NOT main reason that MIA wins or loses gms.  When they've won close gms, it's been Wade who's hit the gm winner each time.  They've lost gms b/c they missed Bosh's inside presence.  They've won plenty of gms when LBJ was the 2nd or even 3rd best player on the team that night.  This is not MVP stuff!  D12 was the clear MVP-type guy in that gm last night!  By comparison, OKC only goes as Durant goes.  When they win close gms, he makes the crucial plays down the stretch 90% of the time.  He always takes the last shot -- make or miss, win or lose!  Westbrook &amp; Harden are very good players, but they're clearly sidekicks.  Durant is the man on that team from start to finish of every single gm.  KD for MVP!!!
Sportsfanatic3379::Preach on player!
Shub2308::Oh wait Lebron makes more money than I ever will but my wife looks better than your girl and my kids are smarter than yours.  He is also going bald at 26.  Delonte west slept with his mom
brycemo22::your wife is freaking creepy man
SANFORDMATT::i slept with her too..
Michael38061::That was something Delonte and Gloria wanted to do, nobody else's business
SANFORDMATT::i slept with her too.
matt_lattos::Lebron had 6 turnovers why nobody is talking about it?  -Jeremy lin
brycemo22::I love Lebron but I say this alot. He is big on turnovers. Scares me
Shub2308::Only time you can win is when Kobe is on your team #olympics
ZachC1965::who's the ho'..?
Shub2308::Tried to wear #23 disrespectful
Shub2308::Go to the club with you mother
Shub2308::Turned your back on the city that beloved you and made you who you are
Shub2308::You let skip bayless clown you over and over
Shub2308::Made fun of the MVP and got dismantled in the finals
Shub2308::New York Yankees fan from Ohio.  Dallas cowboys fan.
Shub2308::Have three kids by a woman and don't marry her.   Over charging for ugly shoes.  Witness.  King with no rings.
Shub2308::Lebron walks around like he is the ishhh, you play basketball dude and your not even the best at that.  He needs a slice of humble pie.   An hour special to tell everyone where you are taking your talents.  Referring to yourself in third person.  Would you like me to continue.
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::I thought Cavs fans were over Lebron leaving them since Kyrie Irving was on your team.
RunTheBall22::dolphins pulled a Lebron and choked. they gave away the best player they had for almost nothing because the clock was ticking. Lebron has truly taken over Miami.
Evolver30::Looks like MIA might have this one in the bag. Rose may sit, Deng and CJ are back.
Sportsfanatic3379::.
kcf17::The LeBron/Heat lovers and haters need to chill. Cuz for the haters LeBron IS a great player and the Heat are a solid team and for the lovers yeah both LeBron and the Heat are flawed also, not everything about them is perfect, you're like Green Bay fans.
Sportsfanatic3379::People seem to hate Lebron and Rose for no reason. I would understand if the guys were getting into trouble like Pac-Man Jones and other athletes.
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::D' Antoni's job is on the line again, and I think its serious this time.
Shub2308::Face it Lebron is a cry baby loser az puccy ninja
Shub2308::Money doesn't define who you are
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::Now this is just hating, I dont take it this far.
Aicyla22::a cry baby loser az puccy ninja who makes more $$ in one year than you'll see in your lifetime, try again
Shub2308::He gets paid to play basketball tough job
finalfourinfinity::yep he can buy anything with  his money EXCEPT A CHAMPIONSHIP RING HAHHAHA LOL
kriedel10::ok cool, so why are you talking about such a loser then??? joke's on you
Shub2308::Why are defending him, jokes on you.
finalfourinfinity::the right words to describe lechoke
chisoldier::I dont understand Howard.  Look at how he dominated Miami last night.  How much easier would it be if he had Rose with him against these guys?  They would definitely beat Miami in a 7 game series.
kriedel10::well, let's see, he plays for the Magic and Rose for the Bulls so what don't you understand?  when he is a free agent, he can go wherever he wants
RunTheBall22::He wants to be the number one guy. the Bulls are Rose team and always will be. if Howard came to the bulls he would always be number two behind Rose
chisoldier::My point was, I dont understand why he doesn't want to be in Chicago.
RunTheBall22::If he want to go to the nets than he does not care about winning. he just wants to be the main man and be a super star with all the attention. Rose and Thibs are to hardcore for Howard
Shub2308::Jammer Nelson scored 35, thats not going to happen consistently ona night to night basis
chisoldier::Thats my point, he would get consistent production from Rose every night and it would be an easier series versus Miami if he and Rose were together.
Shub2308::Maybe Phil can let Lebron borrow a ring
Shub2308::I don't expect Lebron ever towin unless David stern gift wraps a trophy
Shub2308::You could also hand check and play tough d
Shub2308::Jordan was battling the champion pistons and other stacked teams.  He also averaged 35 ppg and had no help. Lebron joined 2 all stars and still can't win in the weak east
kriedel10::but i thought LeBron and Miami sucked so why would you expect them to win anything?
kriedel10::yeah, too bad MJ had no rings either at this age but i bet that's a fact you don't acknowledge
Sportsfanatic3379::Lebron fans seem to forget that MJ went to college for 3 years.
mrhandy25::Don't let the fact that MJ went to college for 3 years stand in the way of your defense of LeQueen. MJ won a title in his 7th season, LeQueen is in season 9, do the math fanboy!
kobesmask::Why couldnt Lebron buy a 1 dollar lottery ticket? Cause he couldnt come up with the 4th quarter.,....  hahahahaha
kriedel10::never heard that one before
Shub2308::Lebron travels more than the president
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::Me and my n*gga RunTheBall22 speakin that real sh*t that Miami fans and lebronists dont want to hear! Miami just got exposed last night and Lebron choked as usual. And actualy, only a few of my posts were about lebron. Most of them were about the Heat TEAM and heat fans.
kriedel10::why would you have a name that singles out the Miami Heat as a team you dislike?  makes you sound jealous...
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::This is a temporary account until I think of a better name. This account is gonna get blocked tonight anyways.
Dancing_Chalupa::Now we know why the stupidity.  It's all ghetto.
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::you mean after that dirty player named wade took down our 2nd best player and broke his elbow? yea I remember. I also remember that same guy that you speak of choking in the finals.
kriedel10::i believe it...4 to 1 last year was quite a battle....i forget who closed out those last two games in that series with dagger after dagger....what's his name?
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::Boston Celtics man.Dont waste your breath with negative comments cuz I've heard it all. But I believe they will give teams problems in the playoffs.
Shub2308::$@%!
matt_lattos::JB smoove what is your team?
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::whats all ghetto?
Shub2308::Shub2308 It's funny they were breaking down film of the heat vs magic on espn first take. It clearly shows that lebronna switched his pivot foot, it was so obvious and the refs didn't call a thing. Overrated #fact 1 fan likes this. 59 Seconds Ago  Unlike  Reply  Flag  Edit
kriedel10::yes overrated bc the refs didn't make a certain call..wow, that's dumb
kobesmask::I dont know why people blame Lebron for choking.... He inherited it from his mom...
_i_am_a_Dog_::lebrick chokes on the court and the heat fans choke on my boner
Nanrad_91::I don't usually get on the Heat board, but when I do, it is not to troll. Here is why LeBron is considered a choke and not Rose: LeBron has been in the NBA for 9 years compared Rose's 4 (I believe), he has been to the Finals more, and has more experience overall. But, unlike Rose, so far, he doesn't take over in the 4th quarter against better teams. This is not to say he loses all of the time or anything like that, but he is not as dominant as he is in the preceding 3 quarters. Rose, on the other hand, does take over if he can. He knows he is the best player on his team, of course, so he is willing to do more and take the last shot. We see LeBron take impossible shots all of the time, but not when the game is on the line--he passes it. Rose had a defender on him, stepped back, and took the shot--buzzer beater (v. Bucks). So, it isn't, for me at least, that LeBron misses a shot, but that he doesn't take it and shrinks in the fourth.
Nanrad_91::@Kriedel, is Fisher the best player on his team? No? Fisher takes the shot. There is a difference between being a clutch player and having clutch moments? Fisher has clutch moments, but is not a clutch player. LeBron CAN be a clutch player, but chooses not to be by deferring the ball and shrinking in the fourth. Which is one of the reasons people have turned him into a punchline. Most fans can see that LeBron doesn't want the burden of responsibility for taking the last shot for fear of missing, which is why it backfired. He's not passing because the man is open, he is passing because he is afraid of backlash.
Dancing_Chalupa::You don't do much research.
kriedel10::Derek Fisher has made a buzzer beater and big shots in the past so by proving he can do it, we should call him a choker at the end of every close game now bc he has the ability to perform but chooses to shrink from the moment?    why is only LeBron held to this standard?
kriedel10::what??  exactly, five rings so he really should be taking over bc he has so much experience so why isn't he?
Shub2308::5 rings
Nanrad_91::...
Nanrad_91::Yes. And I'm also talking about this year since the Heat fans claim that the Bulls fans live in the past aka last year.
-whoa-::well said
Dancing_Chalupa::Did you even watch the playoffs last year?
sokal-surf::What is more likely to happen in the final 5 seconds of a game where the Heat need a basket to win?  A) Go inside to Bosh. B) Wade draws a phantom foul out on the perimeter. C) LeBron passes to Haslem. D) Everyone dances and sings on the sidelines for the loss.
-whoa-::E) C and D
RunTheBall22::The heat should have three closers, whats the problem over there.  I thought those three had it all locked up, made in the shade sitting by the pool sipping on gin and juice, candy makes you dandy. what happened?
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::Keep speakin that real ish bruh!
kriedel10::why do you care?  worry about your own team
Aicyla22::there is no problem, thanks for your concern though
-whoa-::clearly there is a problem because lechoke doesnt know what to do with the ball in the final minutes,  he should just let wade, the champion handle it from now on
-whoa-::lebron and rose are both chokers  im not sure if yall remember the last heat bulls game it was a choking frenzy lebron missed 2 FT rose missed 2 FT turnovers everywhere  the final 2 minutes was a complete disaster
Dancing_Chalupa::I guess that means almost every single player in the league is a choker.
chisoldier::All those guys that you mention have also lost games at the end too.  so what does that say about them?
Dancing_Chalupa::That would remove you from the process then. You are just another troll. You bring nothing .
-whoa-::durant, kobe, melo have all proven their clutchness over and over ray allen, paul pierce have proven they are also clutch  Lechoke James has proven he chokes hard
RunTheBall22::maybe it does to you chalupa, but for those of us with a normal brain we didn't get that.  but you keep trying
RunTheBall22::Rose has two game winners this season. Lebron not so much
-whoa-::oh yah that one vs the Lakers hurt bad
Dancing_Chalupa::That's ok. Heat still won 5th in a row over them.
ohiomike1978::Traveling King in playoff mode early.
finalfourinfinity::no lebrain james and miami leak fans : james aint no choker society: do we really have to remind you every night how stupid you sound?
IFreakinLuvOrlando::Lol stupid, but funny!
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::LMAO wtf are you even saying?
Aicyla22::hmmm so you say "no lebrain james and miami leak fans" you sir are the one that sounds stupid
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::Heat fans and lebronists are always so butt-hurt after a loss lol. Just accept the fact that you have a choker on your team.
RunTheBall22::Lebron is who Skip said he was. mentally weak and can't handle pressure aka choker. after nine years we all know this to be true now. it's not bashing it's just the truth
Chad-Todd::I AGREE
-whoa-::ihate lebron as much as the next guy but Skip is a fucckin idiot
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::Keep speakin that real bruh
Aicyla22::last time i checked it wasn't desirable to lose
Aicyla22::okay well I'm talking about all fans and you statement does not just apply to heat fans, but you try to make it seem that way
Dancing_Chalupa::Actually, about the only thing you talk about is Lebron.
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::But Im on a Heat/Magic board so Im only talking about heat fans right now.not all, just some.
Aicyla22::not just heat fans
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::No but some heat fans are very ignorant after a loss.
soldier00013::cool story bro
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::lol you're cool.
Dem_Canes_Man::?
Dem_Canes_Man::Gex.2 Canes remember when you were in the bulls board trying so hard not to look like a homer? You failed.  ==============================================================================================  have you seen me post anything crazy or homerish according to basketball? have you ever seen me call Rose a choker? Have I blindly posted anything related to the Heat and Lebron?
RunTheBall22::thats because Rose is not a choker. how could you say that.
RunTheBall22::no you do not post crazy stuff
Dem_Canes_Man::I need Gex. 2 to respond. He has been solid since I have been on the boards.  Prime example Gex.2: See RunThe Ball22: do I post things like this guy?
Dancing_Chalupa::He chokes plenty.
Dem_Canes_Man::I think that the term "choking" is subjective on so many levels.   I can only define it as a team giving away a game that is well in hand (that is all that I got).
Dancing_Chalupa::Lebrons stats in last years playoffs. pts 23,7  rb. 8.4  assists 5.9
-whoa-::choking is when the game is on the line tied, down or up 1 possession, and u REPEATEDLY cause ur team to lose in that situation OR u fear the stage of taking the final shot   AKA Lechoke James (refer to my final 5 second simulation below)
-whoa-::just wait til the playoffs where lebron goes from 30ppg to 15
Aicyla22::he's very serious.  heat have lost 10 games this season, he acts like this is a daily occurrence
-whoa-::yessir lol
Dancing_Chalupa::I am surprised nobody has choked you for being an idiot.
Dem_Canes_Man::are you serious?
Dancing_Chalupa::Missing a tough shot is not choking. Missing free throws to win the game is a choke. making a pass to the open guy to win, even if he misses is not choking. To many of these dopes, just daily life is choking.
soldier00013::i agree. choking is also when you get something lodged in your throat and cannot breath.
Gex.2::Reality check for heat fans:  it's not just bulls fans calling lebron a choker, it's the entire NBA, including ESPN.
Aicyla22::lol ESPN is an extremely credible source...
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::true
Aicyla22::better has nothing to do with credibility
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::Can you name a better site?
soldier00013::oh well if they said on ESPN then it must be the truth. these are the same people that call Kobe a closer even though he shoots 30% in the last 5 minutes of games with his team within 5 points.
Dancing_Chalupa::Just the same thing over and over and over. How old are you?
Dem_Canes_Man::and ESPN is the leading NBA authority on basketball?
kriedel10::cool, thanks for the update
-whoa-::5.4.3 "oh shhit the clock is winding down, i dont want to choke, haslem u can choke this one, take one for the team man" 2.1. haslem brick, 0, eeeerrrrrhhhhh(buzzer)  thats what the final 5 seconds of the heat games look like
Dancing_Chalupa::I have seen Jordan, Bird, Magic, Kobe, and many other greats thru the years miss plenty of shots, many which they should not have taken, except for Bird. He was probably the smartest one I've seen.
kriedel10::so if Kerr had missed that shot in the Finals after MJ passed it to him, MJ would be a choker bc he didn't shoot it??
RunTheBall22::heat fans love to play the if game. if Lebron didn't choke all the time he would not be a choker
-whoa-::everyone makes a few stupid mistakes at the end of games, kobe and jordan missed their share of shots, but no one with the kind of talent that lebron has, chokes game after game, its rediculous
Evolver30::MJ had already hit at least 2 SERIES clinchers. He was just spreading the love. He had the team that could hit the shots too.
Dem_Canes_Man::lol....good question sir.
soldier00013::i hope you wear a helmet when you go outside.
-whoa-::why lol?
bjoellevine::I know this:  I nearly choked watching Lebron get blocked twice by Howard on the same layup.
-whoa-::@kriedel10  people emphasize lebron's choking after every game he chokes, thats why it is repeated because he chokes nearly every time the game is on the line
kriedel10::"when your highly favored(like lebron is, being ranked the #1 player in the NBA), and you cant deliver when the game is on the line, you're a choker"  so being a choker depends on your favorability and ranking by a third party???  that's really, really, stupid...try again.
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::Funny you cant explain what choking is. dont call me out  unless you could back your sh*t up. Try again.
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::lol so whats your definition of "choking"?
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::So dont call me out for having my definition of the word when you yourself dont even know what it means. Thats very ignorant.
kriedel10::i haven't been calling people chokers so I don't need to come up with a definition
Dem_Canes_Man::exactly! It's baffling!   Coming from Bulls fans and the JB guy. They can't possibly know the game of basketball.
Dem_Canes_Man::How am I a homer. Have you ever seen me call Rose a choker? Do I associate myself with crazy Heat fans in my post?
Gex.2::Canes remember when you were in the bulls board trying so hard not to look like a homer?  You failed.
C2Poke88::It concerns me that Spoelstra still hasn't seemed to learn from his coaching mistake in the Finals.  The ISO offense with Wade going 1-on-1 at the top of the key and Lebron on Wade's strong side sitting deep in the corner, just gives the opposing defense a pass.  On the potential game winning play, how do you not either have the ball in the hands of your best player OR at least have him involved in the play?  It's stupid for the ball not to be in either Wade's or Lebron's hands while the other one either flashes to the FT line or cutting to the basket from the weak side - and 3-pt shooter opponents have to respect as an outlet.
soldier00013::wade's shot was halfway down, he missed it so you run your mouth. had he made it you would have been celebrating. enough with the spo needs to go crap. if you are so good at coaching then it would be you in the NBA and not spo.
C2Poke88::And where in my post did I say Spoelstra needs to go?  Please point that out since you included that in your rant.
C2Poke88::F*ck you!  Don't tell me what I would have done b!tch!  It was a stupid shot when Wade hit the game-winner against the Pacers and it was still a stupid shot against Orlando.  When you have guys like Wade, Lebron, and Bosh on the same team, we should be doing better than a freakin' 20-ft step-back jumper to try and win the game.
Dancing_Chalupa::The play opened up the center for DWade to try and make the play, as he did on the possession right before. He made a good shot at the end that rimmed out.
C2Poke88::I'm not saying that Wade can't make the shot.  He can.  I'm saying that we should be able to get better shots than that in those situations.
Dancing_Chalupa::It isn't that low percentage for Wade. The shot was fine. It just rimmed out. You have a bad memory.
C2Poke88::That was not a good shot.  Even it had gone down.  There is no way a step-back 20-ft jump shot should be considered a good shot in that situation.  It's a low percentage shot that every defense in the NBA wants a great player to settle for in that situation.
mccoywajmu::Derrick Rose is 13th in the league in FTs attempted per game..he is behind people like rodney stuckey, john wall, james harden, and COREY MAGGETTE..Thats a cause to complain im sure
C2Poke88::Bullcrap!  He may be 13th in attempts, but 3-4 of the guys in front of him are only  getting .1 or .2 more FTs per game.  That's nothing.  They are basically getting the same amount of FTs per game.  Wade is only 11th I think and he is just as hard to guard than Rose.  He's actually harder to guard because he can shoot better from the perimeter and has more size.
Dancing_Chalupa::Maybe because the refs see thru some of those plays where DRose jumps and turns sideways into players on his own. Why should he get the foul call? he gets that enough as it is along with so many travels.
Dem_Canes_Man::Your point?
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::when your highly favored(like lebron is, being ranked the #1 player in the NBA), and you cant deliver when the game is on the line, you're a choker.  EX: What lebron did last year in the Finals.
Dancing_Chalupa::Was he? One of the best of his times. No ring. Was he a choker?
Dem_Canes_Man::lol @ Kriedel10! Good point.
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::If he fits the definition then yes. if he doesnt fit the definition then no. My definition has nothing to do with having rings.
kriedel10::uh oh...you found a problem with his argument...don't expect a real answer
Dancing_Chalupa::Ok nevermind. I knew you'd do the run around routine.
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::does he fit my definition?(2nd time asking this)
Dancing_Chalupa::Was Dan Marino a choker?
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::Of course Im a Boston sports fan.
Dem_Canes_Man::wow? and you are a Boston/Basketball fan?
bjoellevine::Don't think you can call Dan Marino a choker.  You have to actually get to a big game first before you can earn that title.
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::No, but if you are suppossedly the best player in the world then yes.
Dem_Canes_Man::so every player who misses shots with the game on the line is a choker?
JB_Smoove_Dislikes_MiamiHeat::does he fit my definition?
