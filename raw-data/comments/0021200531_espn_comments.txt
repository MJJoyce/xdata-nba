Paul1576::The C,s are finally making a run because Doc has his desired rotation in place.With Avery back is world of difference on the defensive end and now there is a set 1st and 2nd unit.Still in dire need of 1good big.
cortzone::Finally with Avery back and the starters barely cracking 30 min. per game, the Knick fans are shi tting their pants. Celt's in first soon. Pretty sure most of us knew once we got healthy with these great additions, C.Lee the Jet it is bombs away, love our chances. Have since day 1. Same as last year went .500 through 30 plus and go right back the ECF 1 game from the whole enchilada. Bad news to non Celtic fans, we are deeper and better than last year.
Road dog Red::The TMZ version of the Garnett/Anthony bus confrontation delivers
Road dog Red::KG is WICKED
ynot1825::I have to be honest I gave up a little on the Celtics 10 games ago. The way in which they've turned things around on D, with their poise against some really good teams surprised me. The Avery impact is incredible. Remains to be seen whether or not they've turned the corner completely but i really like what I'm seeing...Go Celtics.. Note to Danny, leave this team leave as is...
nba is the worst::Holding the Rockets to 91 (15 below avg!) with 27% from 3-pt range was impressive
alexhammm::I like those rockets uniforms.
StevenDanger194::Only 5 games back from first if the heat and knicks continue to lose we will be in first.
nba is the worst::'Melo led in bricks last night with 18, but it wasn't enough to pass Kobe (who had 15) for #1 in bricks per game: 1. Kobe 11.67 .472 FG% 2. 'Melo 11.59 .465 3. Love 10.72 .352 4. Westbrick 10.69 .416 5. Monta 10.68 .399 6. Felton 9.93 .396 7. Gay 9.85 .413 8. Jennings 9.80 .409 9. Aldridge 9.62 .459 10. Harden 9.53 .455
Im Ignorant::So? look at his field Goal %, its good. And the fact that he is the leagues leading scorer.
jay dog in the house::5 wins in a row lets make it 6 wins.
nba is the worst::Wow - 2 games over .500, great job Celtics
nba is the worst::Not bitter at all,  just cold  (9 degrees here this morning).  Hey, I'm pulling for this team!
nba is the worst::You seem upset  (Nothing wrong with pulling for the Knicks as well, I still want the Spurs to get the title regardless)
_I Am A Celtic_::NO YOU'RE NOT.  You are such a fraud.  We all know you're a knicks fan.  So you can stop pretending to like everyone and just man up.  Piece of sh.it liar
_I Am A Celtic_::You still bitter? Grow up
Fear the Gr0nk::Knicks: 2-5 with Amare $19.94 million Celtics: 5-1 with Bradley $1.63 million
Shaun0088::Wow love that.

BleedBostonGreenOnTo18_::"Avery Bradley won't help you're old team at all."  Hm. :)
stephen9696::Who said Avery won't help your old team?
Shaun0088::People cant see that this team has a good mix of young and old players.From what i've noticed in basketball when a player hits 30 from then on he's considered an "old bum".
boomdads75::No one wants to play the Celtics in the playoffs - FACT
Seven seconds of pleasure::<b> and suddenly, the Celtics are 4 games out of 2nd place in the East  and the lakers are 5 games out of 8th place in the West</b>

Jimmy30313::Did he win? I'll await your response
YaImFromCleveland::Lin outplayed Rondo in this game, sorry bra
SF_Bay_Henri::Rondo is black too. HE WON!!
boomdads75::No f.ucking way is Pierce being traded, that would be devastating..
CJ From San Andreas oX Invincible Xo::Remember when Lin took the game-winning 3 pointer against Miami?
LOF HATERS ARE RACIST AND LIVED IN MOMMAS BASEMENT::YOU MEANT THE GAME WINNING 3 POINTER IN TORONTO?  YES I REMEMBER
BleedBostonGreenOnTo18_::What the $!@% is this I'm reading about Pierce possibly being traded...
Shaun0088::A rumor.
BleedBostonGreenOnTo18_::...No? Possible Lakers/Raptors/Grizzlies trade.
boomdads75::KnicksDontQuit - Gay would be worth it but Pierce should be a C for life unless he wants out.  He has earned it for sure
KnicksDontQuit::Gay would be worth it but Pierce should be a C for life unless he wants out.
