AceVenturaMavsCoach::BREAKING NEWS. Dwight said he won't play for Van Gundy no more. which means He's coming to Dallas next year.
shannon5473::Kobe plays hard all game despite any shortcomings. http://sportsmediummessage.blogspot.com/2012/04/kobe-clutch-lakers-vs-hornets.html
crawnjc1982::i wonder if kobrick is going to puff out his chest once he goes 3-25? SMH. His comments proved that this guy is def an "all about me" ball player.
shannon5473::After Sunday's game against the Warriors. I took another look at the Saturday game against the Hornets. While many will look at the box score and claim that Kobe had a horrible night, there was much more to it. Of course, going 3-21 is never great, but upon closer examination, Kobe definitely played within the offense. Kobe finished strong and ended up sinking the game winning 3. This blog examines this, check it out. http://sportsmediummessage.blogspot.com/2012/04/kobe-clutch-lakers-vs-hornets.html
Maralookslikethejoker::You got nothing to come back with  Translation of hater comments   Kobe is too old=he beats my team   Kobe needs to retire=I don't want him to win   Kobe doesn't have a very good FG%=I've been looking at the stat sheet all night and it's the only bad thing about him   Kobe won't win another championship=I'm afraid of him   Kobe sucks=I couldn't find any more excuses   Kobe got swept=got nothing more to say cause he still won the 2 years before that   Kobe rapes women= I'm a fourth grader that doesn't have a mommy to send me to school cause she is well busy*wink*  Kobe takes to many shots= I don't know jack about basketball. if I did, I would know that Kobe plays a shooting guard that means he shoots a lot, even when he has a broke finger and torn ligments in his hand.   Kobe needs to pass the ball more= I still don't know jack about basketball because if I did I would know that Kobe is second in the NBA among shooting guards in assists.    Players have bad games. Look at Dirk against the Lakers 36 points on 11-28 shooting for a big that is really bad. I said for a big man its bad. He does shoot from the outside but he also should be really close to the basket to score his points*I didn't see the game but come on that was really bad for a big*. Kobe is having a lot of bad games but He does have some really good ones at times too.   The following night Lebron had the same shooting night as kobe did.

elibird123::What do you call two dumb guy agreeing with each other?   Dumb &amp; Dumber
Mr. Incredible.::agree. The guy is smart. Maybe if Kobe went to college, he would of learned that basketball is a team sport
SirCrazyWolf.::I agree with you about agreeing with me.
Mr. Incredible.::List of players better than Kobe (please feel free to add the players I left out)  Andrew Bynum Pau Gasol Derrick Rose Kevin Durant Russell Westbrook James Harden Lebron James Dwyane Wade Jeremy Lin (yup he dropped 38 on Kobe) Chris Paul Blake Griffin Kevin Love Dirk Nowitzki Dwight Howard Steve Nash
shannon5473::Disagree completely with this list. Kobe is clutch and keeps playing hard no matter what. Take a look. http://sportsmediummessage.blogspot.com/2012/04/kobe-clutch-lakers-vs-hornets.html

Georgio Auditore da Firenze::This must be the first season ever that every team that goes to the post season will have a record above .500
DidYouSeeThat36::I noticed that too, shortened season?
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::You are correct
elibird123::The group of haters that we will just call “Mr. Unrealistic-Casual fan.”  That’s the guy who watches about 10-15 basketball games a year, normally at a bar where he isn’t even paying attention and by the time the game is over, he is too drunk to even tell you what happened in the game.  He is the guy who yells out “all I know is when Shaq left, Kobe couldn’t even get out of the first round.”  It’s hard to really argue with him because he is right, that is all he knows.  He never mentions that Kobe lost in the first round to a Suns team that had All Star Shawn Marion as the third option, while the Lakers third leading scorer was Brian Cook.
the_alba_bang::Man, this is great. It's genius how you are speaking about a certain type of person but referring to a wide collective of people.
elibird123::There is the group of haters who always seem to think Kobe is the second best player in the league no matter what.  Let this group tell it, Bryant has been the second best player in the NBA for over a decade, but the number 1 player changes every other year.  Somehow the number 1 player always seems to fall down the list but Kobe just never moves up.  There was the he’s not better than Iverson debate that lasted for a couple of years, then there was the he’s not better than Tracy McGrady campaign which was followed by he’s not better than Steve Nash era -- hell even Chris Paul got his name mentioned for a year as the one guy in the NBA who is better than Kobe.This is the fan who has become a diehard Cavs fan out of nowhere. He is the same guy who years ago said that if Vince Carter or Tracy McGrady ever played with the best center in the NBA they would win a title too. Now it's Prince James &amp; Durant. His favorite line use to be "Kobe will never win without Shaq", but he never seems to remember saying any of that. He often has a lot to say in the regular season, but not so much in the playoffs.
SecondComing99::lol this $@%!$ the truth... it's a shame because it wasn't just fans, it was the media too. They killed him for 4 or 5 yrs...  He should have 2 to 3 more MVPs and thats not a lie. I'm pretty sure he put up better numbers in the years he didn't win the MVP than when he did but I could be mistaken.
the_alba_bang::Man, this is exactly what I've been saying for years. One of those Nash MVPs and that Dirk MVP most definitely belongs to Kobe. If Kobe hasn't been the most despised dude in the NBA overall then I don't know what to call it. And still put up crazy numbers and win CHIPS. This is why he is included in the Jordan convos and these other guy's favorite players are not.
DidYouSeeThat36::Well said elibird, bravo
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::That is why unlike Lebitch Kobe doesn't care about what people say
BayAreaZ::Kobe might honestly be the worst player in the NBA at this point...  3 for 21, 3 for 20, 9 for 31, 8 for 26, 4 for 15, etc etc etc...  Any other player would have been benched or cut by now. He is stinking it up.
SecondComing99::lol bay area is mad cuz he cant get the taste of hippy dick out his mouth
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::There is no etc etc lol you are just p Counting his worst five games of the season.  You are a hater
Ringchamp24::@Mr. Incredible- That wasn't the "biggest game of his life"; he already had FOUR RINGS up to that point.
Mr. Incredible.::6-24 in the biggest game of his life
elibird123::Oooh, 5  games or so. Any other player is not Kobe Bryant idiot.
Georgio Auditore da Firenze::Bad streak due to fatigue does not a make up for a great season.
biggerandbetterthanyou::ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fail hoho. .421 FG% is due to a lot more than a streak. Dude is a stone cold chucker with terrible Defense
I want to spoon with Melo::MElo ain't much better.  And his team is .500.
RicoSuave925::LeChoke, LeQuit, LeQueen,LeClown,LeBrick,LePass? Which one is your favorite?
