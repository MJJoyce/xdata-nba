brianvin948::Griz have one of the best starting 5s in the league as long as Zach is back.  They learned a lot during last  years run, they know what it takes and they now have Rudy.  Even if the starting units are a push (which I doubt), Clippers can not keep up with the Griz bench - Mayo, Speights, Cunningham, Pondexter &amp; Arenas are all strong.  That's the biggest difference - Griz in 5!!
