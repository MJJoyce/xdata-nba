bob Z::Orlando was not ready to play tonight. You have to put that on management. They are soft.
DANTE The Ghost Hunter::Obviously Orlando does not want to spend money or make any trades so they should just Play Oladipo Exclusively at SG. Nicholson should be starting at PF for the Magic. Orlando really needs to upgrade at the PF they should try and go for Lamarcus Aldrige and pull a trade off for Rudy Gay-
edward::Orlando doesn't match up well against Dallas. They need a big game from Vuch.
ROGER-K::More DeJuan Blair with another stellar game. Mav's extend his contract now!!!
Ma$e::Magic got rooked on their own court on that offensive foul call.
Ma$e::Vucevic with 3 very bad plays down the stretch
Anton::Talk about no defense. Both teams shooting 50+% lol
Shane F::had nothing to do with matchup oladipoopoo had 9 turnovers. That lost them the game.
PKM::Does Dirk ever play inside anymore?
fup duck::Calderon should not be taking more shots than Dirk
