Go_Sounders::Man the Sonics suck....
Kpmg allstar::Patterson did not play?
razzledazzletj81::The Kings took 22 3's last night. How many were taken by the #11 3 pt shooter in the league? 1 How many of the other shots were taken by anyone that even ranks in the top 40 for 3's? 0
razzledazzletj81::yeah, I do when the best shooter on the team gets overlooked by his team-mates over and over. When Jimmer gets away from this mess he will be in the Top 10 for 3's and Top 5 for FT's year after year in his prime. Coach Smart will be witnessing it from his couch like me.
dog_has_fleas::They shoot 54% from 3 and you complain? Seriously?
ShadowChicken23::As a kings fan, I'm very surprised we didn't trade IT22.....I mean I think he's a little overrated, a 5 foot 8 PG should not be taking 18 shots....though he probably shouldn't be getting 6 rebounds either! But , in any case, I thought FOR SURE a playoff team would trade for him, he's the PERFECT 6th man, small, quick, can score from almost ANYWHERE and has the ability to throw some dimes
CamOverRG3::What a game by Isiah
LetsGoBraves2012::lebron james is no match josh smith
LetsGoBraves2012::josh smith will lead us to the nba finals
DerekJeter212::#FreeJimmer
JBurhenn253::Young zeke did his thing!
blackthursday13::Ive seen games when Cuz and Reke have really good 1st Qs and then sit out until 1:30 in the 2nd just awful. The heat either have wade or lebron in at all times, you should have at least a go to option on the floor at all times. Not Garcia (gone now), Brooks, Outlaw, Hayes, and JT
razzledazzletj81::Another disgusting display of selfishness from the Kings. $@%!$ as usual.
blackthursday13::Keith smarts rotation is worse than my nba 2k rotation and i dont sub
Craig_Sagers_Suits::its so bad
blackthursday13::at least we are almost good on the amount of lead guards we have. just a couple more... how bout AI
blackthursday13::hahaha
yorke44::ESPN trade alert: James Johnson and Jason Thompson for Rodney Stuckey and Will Bynum.
Craig_Sagers_Suits::proposed by geoff petrie
yorke44::"Kings ownership documents reveal major potential stumbling blocks for Seattle." This is for u Craig Sager Suits...... http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/04/kings-ownership-documents-reveal-major-potential-stumbling-blocks-for-seattle/ Seattle prepare to be "Maloofed."........"Maloofed".....coming to a vocabulary near u this spring.
yorke44::^ If you're not optomistic about the Kings staying, you will be after u read this....^
Craig_Sagers_Suits::I hope you are right
yorke44::Ya see don't let the maloofs fool u they lost the Palms becuz they have no business experience. They're just using their dad's money to do whatever they want......They're trying to pull a fast one on us.
Craig_Sagers_Suits::this article makes me feel better about it
yorke44::They r in the process of getting a subpeona for the contract which the maloofs arent willing to let them see......hmm I wonder why they won't let them see it.....hmmm....."Maloofed"....coming to a vocabulary near u this spring.
yorke44::The Maloofs breached the contract by selling the team w/o telling the minority owners. The contract states a first right f refusal, which means the minority owners have a fair chance at matching any sale.....So in comes Mark Mastrov and Ron Burkle; they match the offer and the Kings stay.
blackthursday13::IT is not a point guard. Pgs are supposed to want to set up their teamattes. he just jacks shots all game every game. Yeah he is a good scorer but get your team involved
blackthursday13::he had 9 dimes but you can tell the others get bored out there. tyreke didnt touch the ball the whole 2nd Q and was pretty much off scoring wise the rest of the way
Craig_Sagers_Suits::he does look for teammates at times, but I will say he might want to look to get others involved more. But he had 9 dimes tonight
Craig_Sagers_Suits::WHY did the kings not bring back Twill and decided to sign Brooks? damn you petrie
James312318::Looking at the box scores.....i think we are just fine keeping smith over cousins =)
Nargash35::Trade IT Kings management in the offseason. This guy needs to play next to real players not bunch of thugs..!!
Craig_Sagers_Suits::why doesnt the management just try to improve the team?
Craig_Sagers_Suits::I hope you are right, Im not that optimistic though
yorke44::Ron Burkle and Mark Mastrov r gunna buy the team and keep them here. Here's a link http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/04/kings-ownership-documents-reveal-major-potential-stumbling-blocks-for-seattle/
Craig_Sagers_Suits::If only there were owners who had the money to keep them in sacramento
Nargash35::Because they are cheap. Seattle group will pay a lot of money to bring talent to the Sonics..!!
James312318::From what i'm hearing it seems Keith Smart is trying to get fired rather than quitting
Craig_Sagers_Suits::maloofs wont fire him even if he slapped jimmer
yorke44::And since the Maloofs r trying to fail, they have their man in place....he's not going anywhere as long as they own this team.
MiamiHEATNATION305::How is SA going to beat MIA if they can't beat ATL?
MiamiHEATNATION305::I meant Sacramento. lol.
Craig_Sagers_Suits::Are you at all worried about the kings?
Craig_Sagers_Suits::wrong board
James312318::two of their starters were out that game
UGA_Dawgz_90::lol@kings' fans. Keith Smart cant be worse than Larry Drew
souptwins::Keith Smart was adopted.
yorke44::Oh but he's much much worse.....
James312318::from what i'm hearing he is lol
Joshua43786::Vinny Del Negro. That is all
Craig_Sagers_Suits::Smart is worse
Craig_Sagers_Suits::He is
Craig_Sagers_Suits::122 pts, nice defense
Jim7419::It was jimmers fault. Ask coach moron.
Joshua43786::"IT had 30 points, your minutes will be down next game." -Keith Smart
yorke44::"I've no choice but to go back to brooks."  -"Coach" u know who
Joshua43786::Ordinarily this would be a joke, but with Keith Smart its very likely
Lemuel7043::lmao
igoman12::The game has been out of hand for while so why does jimmer only play 5 min? $@%!$@ bag coach
KODAK 1234::Jimmer has no defensive skills the Hawks didn't get going tii he came in.
souptwins::Seriously?  How can a guy who played so few minutes be responsible for 122 pts?
yorke44::JJ only played 7, but salmons and Outlaw sure played a lot.
UGA_Dawgz_90::nice bounce back win, but the Kings have the talent to have a much better record. What gives?
souptwins::Do you have time for a book?  No leadership, spoiled thugs, no team work, selfish play, a coach who's name lies about him.......
Jim7419::Too many ball hogs!
yorke44::"Coach" $@%!$
Joshua43786::Coaching
yorke44::Salmons 2-7 fg 5 pts. 1 reb. 2 ast.  -"Wow I need to give him more mins."  -"Coach" $@%!$
Craig_Sagers_Suits::James Johnson &gt; Salmons
Craig_Sagers_Suits::I already know, he might not have a jumper but he attacks and defends. And he's younger
yorke44::I'm tryin to tell u!!!!!!!
braveandme::Breaking News: The Kings suck
Baby J.Cole::Kings need to move to Pluto
yorke44::Total fail.
Craig_Sagers_Suits::not this tool
Craig_Sagers_Suits::why?
Baby J.Cole::shut up boogie, go to haven
Roweey::Did i just see Jenkins make Thomas fall?..
Craig_Sagers_Suits::Great games by IT and Cousins, good start by evans but a crap 2nd half.
mariomahmoud::Sacramento fans, would u do a trade of Devin Harris, Mike Scott, and a first round pick for D. Cousins?
James312318::sign and trade?
mariomahmoud::Yeah that would be the best case scenerio
James312318::i mean at least cousins isn't dum enough to ask for more money right after he got suspended by his own team...
James312318::how about we trade smith for cousins ?
mariomahmoud::Smith's a free agent
Craig_Sagers_Suits::Not a chance
Craig_Sagers_Suits::petrie might do that trade, but it wouldnt happen in real life without including smith or horford
mariomahmoud::So who would u want, I'm determined to get this done lol
Craig_Sagers_Suits::GG Hawks fans, gl the rest of the year
Joshua43786::Good luck to you guys in the future. Hope you get the ownership situation resolved
Craig_Sagers_Suits::me too
Joshua43786::"Why should I guard Korver at the 3 point line?" -Keith Smart
yorke44::Hey atleast hes consistent w leaving the best 3-pt shooters WIDE OPEN.
Craig_Sagers_Suits::kings suck in the 4th Q
dolphinsbyu::Keith smart has the most unconsistent sub patterns. He has to be on something
Joshua43786::I don't think he has a pattern with anything when it comes to coaching.... He just does whatever makes the least amount of sense
yorke44::Pretty much.
Lemuel7043::Jeff teague doing rondo impression
dmorrisssey::Game of the year!
yorke44::#Free The Kings!!!! (From "Coach" $@%!$)
Craig_Sagers_Suits::and from the owners and GM
yorke44::Yes!!
Joshua43786::Nice fake
mariomahmoud::I'd do anything to make Demarcus Cousins on the Hawks.  C-Cousins  PF-Horford SF-Smith(resign him) SG- Monta Ellis(Sign him) PG- Teague  And our bench would include Lou Williams, Jenkins, Zaza and our 2 1st round picks
Lemuel7043::$@%! MONTA. you want a guy shooting 23% from 3 and a chucker?
mariomahmoud::Then who, with all the money coming off the books we can make a splash, is Andre Igadaulo(spelling) a free agent next year?
Joshua43786::So you'd want two head cases in the same locker room??
James312318::no just give josh to some other team i'll rather have cousins than smith
mariomahmoud::I'm willing to take that chance, and winning tends to lessen frustration
James312318::Thank you, i though i was the only one who saw this...
Craig_Sagers_Suits::geoff petrie wants a PG, so cousins for harris
Craig_Sagers_Suits::its a joke
kfilter::for harris are you serious maybe for rondo
88jsdnjd::game over
yorke44::Evans back to shoot a few more 3's :(
braveandme::Demarcus Cousins is a crappy version of Josh Smith
James312318::he is GETTING fat.
James312318::it's the other way around, trust me. Demarcus is better than josh right now, josh is getting fat...
braveandme::If Josh Smith is fat than 99% of people in this world are obese
James312318::Dhanty Jones can't play because he doesn't have the throw back jersey for those who were wondering
austinwantsyou::oh god korver got crossed
Craig_Sagers_Suits::why couldnt keith smart have been part of the deal? I'd rather have bobby jackson coach
yorke44::I'd rather have u coaching.
Craig_Sagers_Suits::I miss adelman
yorke44::Ur probably right....I mean how much worse can it get?????
Craig_Sagers_Suits::I'd probably be better
yorke44::Memo to "Coach" $@%!$:  Could u please play James Johnson.....he's one of our best all around players, and probably our best defender beside Hayes.....Thanx.
Joshua43786::"Guys, I know Deshawn Stevenson is lighting it up, but why should I try to put a man on him?" -Keith Smart
yorke44::Kings under Smart are notorious for leaving good 3 pt shooters WIIIIIIIIIIDE OPEN from beyond the arc, play after play after play.
James312318::lol too funny
Craig_Sagers_Suits::He's made 4 of 5? he'll miss the next one -smart
Craig_Sagers_Suits::yep, its probably over
James312318::and I.T. checks in.....
austinwantsyou::Are the hawks gonna play dhanty jones
