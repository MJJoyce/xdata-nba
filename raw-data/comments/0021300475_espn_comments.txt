Josh Sweat::look at Noah one of the few bigs in the league capable of a triple double- RESPECT
Viju Patel::CHICAGO may sneak in the POSTSEASON as an 8th seed so let's see what's in store for the BULLS until then and I'VE ALWAYS LOVED this BULLS team's FIGHTING SPIRIT of NEVER AT ALL giving up NO MATTER WHAT. GO BULLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Andrew Vellucci::#BattleForThe8thSeed
Chelo Mejias::It's all about 18, book it!
Carlos Cardoso::Its all about the number one pick.
Chelo Mejias::Carlos Cardoso   Too bad the celtics will be in the playoffs. number 1 pick goes to the worst team
Daniel Taylor::Bulls will be battling for a top 4 seed by seasons end . Thibs learning to manage minutes
Taylor Manes::I wouldn't be surprised if the bulls lose...but I'm sure I mean 30% sure we will win..
Nate Grier::a must win for the Bulls. Put it in the books.
Anthony Duncan::What we’re saying is, of the 66 NBA champions, 64 of them were either a No. 1 seed (47), a No. 2 seed (10) or a No. 3 seed (7). They still play a 16 team playoff? Money over Parity. This league should be 20 teams and not 30. And a playoff of 8 and not 16.
Robert Janousek::Never going to happen.   Good luck at telling 10 owners that they need to give up their billion dollar businesses.
Anthony Duncan::Awful win.. I'm really disappointed with this organization. The lack of foresight is frustrating. This team healthy is not winning a title.
Robert Janousek::This team will be lucky to get out of the first round.  They had an opportunity when they were only 3 games better than Milwaukee but now they've blown it and are sitting at the 7th seed.
Pedro Martinez::Lets get it Green !!! Boston Celtics you could still win division step it up tonight !!!!
Shoot Jung::Celtics will win!
Josh Sweat::this is the chic that said the heat would win maybe you should rethink some things before you jinx your teams
Mike Bird Munger::AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND ONCE AGAIN THE NBA PROVING HOW F-CKING RIDICULOUS THEY ARE!!!  NOW GOING UP WITH TWO HANDS TO BLOCK A SHOT IS A FLAGRANT FOUL IF YOU'RE A CELTIC!!!  GTFOH STERN YOU F-CKING CROOK!!!
Matthew Stone::that was a flagrant. calm down.
Mike Bird Munger::Matthew Stone Not even close.  The ONLY reason Kennedy called it a Flagrant 1 was because he hates the Celtics.  He ejected Doc for NOT saying anything to him once.  He's one of Stern's goons.
Kevin Brown::shut up
Jake Gilliland::Bulls got to go all power and attack the rim with their Big Men who can all score,dunk or pass every night...Trust in Thibs to make the adjustments IF he has a healthy roster to do it...
Mike Bird Munger::LOL@ STERN ASSIGNING CELTICS HATER BILL KENNEDY TO REF ANOTHER GAME VS CHICAGO AND PEOPLE STILL THINK THERE'S NO ANTI-CELTICS AGENDA!!!  GTFOH!!!
Matthew Stone::huh, then i'd consider the league pro celtics as the last thing this team wants is to make the playoffs.
Liam Sibson::Green, Crawford, and Bradley continue to do....wait for it.....absolutely NOTHING at all.  Seriously, only this team can blow an 18 point lead to Atlanta despite them shooting 33-91.  It's like they DON'T WANT to win...
Taylor Manes::Don't act too shocked to find out you're winning..the bulls know how to slip too..it's like they will be winning and 10 minutes later I find out their losing by 10...*scratching head*like what the heck happened???
Liam Sibson::The Bulls will be down by 25 in the 3rd quarter and win by 1 point, game-winning shot at the buzzer in the 4th. They'll shoot 25% (Deng 0-11) and still win. Crawford and Green will combine for 12 points.  Calling it.
Casiano Servaz Tubana III::Rondo needs to come back soon and I'm not saying that it will help the C's but it will boost the team up..
Liam Sibson::God this team is so depressing...How can anyone bear to watch them right now?
Viju Patel::OH YES i believe that's the lakers and the CELTICS who are DEPRESSING to WATCH, NUFF SAID!!!!!!!!!!GO BULLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Trevor Hennington::...I'm still trying to figure out which team you are talking about.
Liam Sibson::Clearly the Celtics, who lost...to the 12-18 Bulls that don't have Rose...and are now 1-5 in their last 6 and soon falling even further.
Ron Midgette::I Just Love watching the Nets self destruct......again!
Mark Antwan::Brooklyn gets a Win tonight
Ron Midgette::Mark Antwan ...I saw that... they actually played Defense and made a nice comeback. I'm just hoping the Celtics get 2 good picks in the Draft. ATL needs to start losing though!
Elizabeth Leo::Anyone know if Jarred Sullinger is playing?
JCorey Wilde::Lets do this celtics , tonight we bleed green...
Dave Gillespie::Jeez....c'mon Rondo
Jeoby Redondo::celtics will win tonight
Josh Sweat::haha think again smarty
Mario's GameShop::jeoby, again how that work out for ya??? Cs suck, the refs hand the Bulls 7 Techs tonight to 0 Techs for Cs, and yet Cs still cant beat a Roseless Bulls team..lmfao
Casiano Servaz Tubana III::That's a lot of talk coming from these sad Bulls fans whose teams not going anywhere this year lol.. I understand the bitterness when your team hasn't won sh*t for decade!
Kiel Capers::SULLINGER SUCKS
Dmitriy Averchenkov Skelley::who u a fan of?
BriggzAve General::my celtics boys got this
Jake Gilliland::can you please add "clueless predictor" to your microbio after 'hustler' ?
