Rickster7218::No PT for Warrick again...WTF is going on in Doomsville....
verfielderbrera::As far as shooting percentage goes Jose Calderon is Shooting over .550 from the field and .611 from 3 point land while averaging 7 assists and 5 rebounds a game as a point guard. Out of all the players in this trade this is the player that is playing out of his mind right now. To give you an example Rudy gay is shooting .379 from the field and .275 from 3 point land. He may have the most points but he's taking a huge amount of shots to get to those 20 points a game. Pistons won in this deal. Especially if they can re-sign him.
JohnsonnnL::That was a vicious dunk by MKG
KevinHate::MJ, suit up already
YogaBeer::Monroe with the monster game!
dendu_va::OK, I'm a VMI guy, so I'll admit bias, but can anyone tell me why a team as bad as Charlotte DNP-CDs a scorer like Reggie Williams every night?
coconutheadtaro::Bobcats Drafting  Griner next year for their first overall pick.
Philip3664::LMAO
9er_Bestia_Mode_3::Trade Dwight!
Baby J.Cole::#teamxat  http://xat.com/ESPNPeople
bamberg1977::Ha, Kings are dumping the #5 pick in last years draft, Thomas Robinson, for chicken feed. Patrick Patterson.   I dont think I can think of a quicker bust of a pick, ever
Genghis Kittah::They never even played him that doesn't mean he's a bust
JimDetroitFan95::It will probably take a 27mil 3 year offer to keep Calderon, and I am in favor of it.  You realize that they paid Stuckey 25 mil for 3 years, correct?
retiredat23::I'm not sold on Calderon - Brandon Knight is our future point guard, not Jose. He's a nice player and all, but I'll take his 10 mil expiring contract and let it ride
bamberg1977::Yeah, but at the time stuckey was seen as a young guy with still some upside not even in his prime yet.
bamberg1977::Dont know. Only teams who will really be interested are good teams, and most of them are capped out. Pacers for instance, but they can only offer MLE. 9 per seems a little extreme, but its possible. I think we might be able to do it for 6 or 7 per.
Detroit Everything::Good talking to you guys tonight, here's one more for the road  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=adevl2w  PEACE OUT
retiredat23::Fantastic trade, absolutely beautiful
bamberg1977::J. Harden, R. Westbrook, K Durant increase our win total by 8.   That means we might win 38 games with them!!!!  I think that system is broke.
Philip3664::Love it
mattcowboys77::masterpiece
ccgagnon365::Beautifully done. Later.
ccgagnon365::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=byhqsdr  I may have gotten a little carried away.
retiredat23::That's a horrible trade
mattcowboys77::you think?!
DTownSportsLions::The Wizards just drafted Bradley Beal they are looking to move Jordan Crawford. I would be interested in him. He's young and cheap, and he can score.
retiredat23::Score? More like chuck
mattcowboys77::nah
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Actually, before I go, DetroitEverything what are you studying? I totally empathize, because I'm in the same boat.
Detroit Everything::thanks guys!
Detroit Everything::well im in medical school but i have a lame risk management final tomorrow which is basically a class about Law
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::That's up my alley. I just finished law school and I'm studying for the bar. OK, best of luck.
mattcowboys77::good luck!
zewn93::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine  I wish
ccgagnon365::I wish I could see it.
mattcowboys77::same
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Well, Detroit plays Utah on March 11, so I'm sure I'll talk to you all then. Have a pleasant and restful evening.
mattcowboys77::see you then.
Detroit Everything::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=aghbaqy  I fixed the previous 3 way deal with the heat and lakers to make more sense for all parties involved.
mattcowboys77::you know when people write lol but do not laugh. I LOLED.
ccgagnon365::How did you even manage to work that out?
mattcowboys77::well then...
Detroit Everything::lol i know, i was referencing this http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/31946674.jpg
mattcowboys77::I think he was complimenting you.
Detroit Everything::do you math bro? Lol, I'm not sure my mind works better at pointless stuff when I don't want to study
ccgagnon365::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=bhntkcb  Please pay absolutely no attention to the projected wins/losses
bamberg1977::I dont think J. Smith makes us better. What is Monroe going to be the 6th man, or J. Smith? I think he'd hate it here. He's older. Shoot for younger, closer to rest of core
bamberg1977::Only in your world
ccgagnon365::Josh Smith is a SF...
mattcowboys77::replace dumars
ccgagnon365::I'd love to.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::No way the Pistons give of Middleton for that deal
ccgagnon365::Oh haha my bad.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I was just adding to the joke.
ccgagnon365::Middleton has no future as a Piston. He just isn't good enough.
mattcowboys77::credit goes to dtownsportslions  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine/?tradeId=auqe4fo  too good
retiredat23::Brilliantly done
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::No way the Pistons give of Middleton for that deal
JVCyoung3589::lets go pistons
mattcowboys77::GOOD TIMING
mattcowboys77::Pacers took the Knicks downtown......
Detroit Everything::guys i just won the internet  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=al9w865
JVCyoung3589::lol lebron would carry us to the playoffs
mattcowboys77::2nd best of the night.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I do support anything that could make the Lakers even worse.
Detroit Everything::aw crap, now the lakers have ONLY big men and the heat have no big men
ccgagnon365::Let's do it.
ccgagnon365::Joe Dumars if you happen to be looking at this conversation board please trade Will Bynum and Jason Maxiell for Evan Turner and Royal Ivey. Thank you.
retiredat23::Why would Philly do that....the #2 pick for Bynum and an expiring Maxiell? Needs some work
Detroit Everything::look at the win differential lol  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=byrcj2j
ccgagnon365::See how inaccurate it is....
mattcowboys77::jesus calderon!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::The very definition of Win-Win
ccgagnon365::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=atx44ue  What do you guys think?
Detroit Everything::+1? lol
ccgagnon365::Those things are horribly inaccurate.
mattcowboys77::I like Bynum though.
mattcowboys77::you have convinced me pull the trigger
ccgagnon365::If we do this he wouldn't have to as long as Stuckey could play PG.
mattcowboys77::Never seen the other guy play.
ccgagnon365::Do you like him or Turner more?
LesGold4TigersManager::come to my store, give me your gold!
LesGold4TigersManager::Les Gold for Piston Owner!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::What is it the Pistons need? Disinterested party, just curious.
retiredat23::We need a SG that can actually shoot and an athletic, slashing SF......
ksuwildcats00::Just snag bill walker out of FA?
ksuwildcats00::luke ridnour?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::That might be doable. He was on the block for a while. Minny FO said they took him off the trading block, but I'm sure for the right deal they'd trade him.
ksuwildcats00::Shved from minny.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Minny wouldn't trade him either. They've got him for cheap for two more years after this season.
ksuwildcats00::Rubio
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Well Minny isn't trading him.
mattcowboys77::I think you are on something
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Their sights on anyone in particular?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Might be wise for him to do that. He can probably get twice what he's getting now. Would Detroit pay him $8 million or more?
bamberg1977::Player Option. He's opting out. He's a FA
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::He has another year on his deal. I don't know if Cuban is ready to trade him.
bamberg1977::Mayo in offseason. Personally I think E. Turner is really under the radar. Dont know if he's gettable. But I'd trade for him.
bamberg1977::High level Wing. Thats it. Anything else would just be more of what we have, or get in the way of developing talent
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::So is that what their deal is? Guys are just young at the moment?
MoBa99::A good 2 or 3 who can score and a good per defender
Detroit Everything::a high scoring SF or SG and above average at defense
Detroit Everything::ok joe dumars has said he won't do any moves that'll compromise the cap flexibility this summer, ergo he probably will trade for someone that has an expiring contract, who knows.
ksuwildcats00::I would marry monroe
ksuwildcats00::I wish
ksuwildcats00::Greg
mattcowboys77::so you are a girl
mattcowboys77::the actress right?
mattcowboys77::he is not doing her....great now i have the image....fu
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::That's necrophilia
ccgagnon365::If the Pistons don't trade Rodney or Corey by tomorrow I'm going to be ticked. Everyone else can stay.
Detroit Everything::Stuckey only if we're getting value in return, won't be worth it to get rid of him just for a dump. I'm willing to give up Maggette Maxiell and bynum for nothing
bamberg1977::For who? I dont think either is worth much, so what do you upgrade with not much?
MoBa99::Pistons only got Corey because he was an expiring contract.... I was very happy with getting rid of Gordon
mojo3434343434::o.j mayo or josh smith
mojo3434343434::naw just pumped up for free agency
mattcowboys77::Me too but not obsessed
mattcowboys77::are you doing a bet or something?
ccgagnon365::smith if we resign Calderon
MoBa99::I'm OK with keeping Calderon as long as it's not more than 4 years
bamberg1977::I think you'd have to go over the MLE to keep him. 4 years, 6 per. Something like that. Because surely there could be contenders who would throw their MLE at him.
bamberg1977::it wouldnt be.
mattcowboys77::3 year 24 mil makes the most sense to me.
mattcowboys77::I doubt he will but I am happy to be wrong here haha
ccgagnon365::Too much money. He'll accept less.
ccgagnon365::And less than 4 or 5 million per year
mattcowboys77::not happening....
mojo3434343434::WHO DO YOU THINK THE PISTONS ARE GOING TO GO AFTER OR SIGN THIS SUMMER
mojo3434343434::chris paul???
DTownSportsLions::Pipe dream brotha
AGirlThatLovesSports_::Tough lost.  I hate clutch situations :(
ccgagnon365::While there are both Detroit and Charlotte fans here what do you guys think about the Tar Heels possibly going to the Big 10?
mattcowboys77::whenever someone mentions tar heels i think of the pistons passing up on ty lawson.
todd7144::no their not
ccgagnon365::They got an offer...
Detroit Everything::here's the thing, if we traded for Maggette to let his contract expire, that will make me mad.
ccgagnon365::Amazingly enough we opened cap space with the trade
ccgagnon365::aka Chris Paul
Detroit Everything::i was really thinking we'd use it and maxiells and bynums for like an 18 million dollar player
Agent Zero7::Ben Gordon really fell off after that Boston/Bulls playoff series a few years ago
joest2003::seems like hes just in it for the money
DTownSportsLions::That series got him paid
mojo3434343434::WHO DO YOU THINK THE PISTONS ARE GOING TO GO AFTER OR SIGN THIS SUMMER
bamberg1977::I 2nd Mayo.
mojo3434343434::what about chris paul
mattcowboys77::HE IS NOT COMING TO DETROIT
DTownSportsLions::I wish but it's not going to happen
DTownSportsLions::Oj Mayo
joest2003::Praying i wake up tomorrow and read that Cats traded Gordon for a big. He is a team killer
ccgagnon365::Why do you think the Pistons traded him?
joest2003::now I can see why
JTorcasso::same here
Agent Zero7::How long do you guys think Calderon will have the starting job? I own him in fantasy.
bamberg1977::If he resigns with Pistons, I say  2 or 3 more years.
mattcowboys77::I see what you did there.
mattcowboys77::he is not losing it....but his minutes are controlled by the coach
Agent Zero7::thanks I was just worried since they have a lot of options at guard
ccgagnon365::Breaking News: Detroit trades Corey Maggette to the Bobcats for Ben Gordon and the Piston's 1st round draft pick.
bamberg1977::Ha,. :)
steelersbobcatsredsox::dont even joke about that
mattcowboys77::you win
aarongb25::hahahaha
Detroit Everything::LOL!
aarongb25::Easy $156.00 dollars
mattcowboys77::congrats now go buy me a beer i am only 19.
GoBamaTide::And Mullens costs us the game again...
Detroit Everything::i like calderon and hope he re-signs but I think he will go back to Toronto
JimDetroitFan95::Nonsense.  Why would he after the trade?
Detroit Everything::he cried bro
Philip3664::He just moved his family here. I would hope he stays
aarongb25::gotcha
mojo3434343434::JOSH SMITH TO THE PISTONS
mattcowboys77::I BELIEVE YOU
mojo3434343434::JOSH SMITH TO THE PSITONS
DTownSportsLions::NO!
bamberg1977::No thank you.
Jrayt220::Kemba sucks!!!
joest2003::Knight got more time in the NBA last year and got drafted higher and still puts up less numbers so whats your point
joest2003::so whats Knight then?
bamberg1977::2 years younger with way less experience
steelersbobcatsredsox::hopefully gordon not playing the 2nd half means he was traded
