kenny71682::hey lets not play are best scoring wing wow wonder whos gonna get fired and what changes will be made when the team is a good team the coach is a wash!!!!!!!!!!  hayward needs to come of the bench not miles
kenny71682::why isnt cj miles starting yet are they $@%!$@% retarted
BridgerThePackersFan::jazz rocks
NYeltigre::Nice win.
JAHQUAN3::The Jazz are playing tough and I expect them to win 36 games this year minimum
BlazersWar::WTF? It's embarrassing!
BCfans2::Can we get rid of Felton. I can't watch anymore. Sit him!
nba is the worst::So you miss Andre?  Seriously, as someone that didn't watch, was this a blatant ref job?  I mean 38-13 ft advantage for the home team with each having 40 points in the paint seems a bit one-sided...
natesweet72::Just so tired of seeing the Blazers slack on the road. So tired. Seems like every road game they have to show how cold they can go from the floor. They look so good at home and then will figure out a way to blow just about every road game. So tired of it.
FranciscoKern::I watched the first half and they looked great - I was actually stunned to see they lost this game.    And Felton sucks - I can't stand to watch him.
eazyt_971::Utah plays 15 of its first 22 at home. Their schedule will get alot tougher and they will start to fall once they hit the road. Utah fans are doing alot of talking now but the jazz still have 2 $@% whoopings waiting for them in Portland and I guarantee they will be looking up at Portland when the season ends.
ryensgin::we'll see
58rhodes::More FrailBlazer news tomorrow @11
oathsky777::WOW FANS HERE LMFAO
Kobelies247::So quiet in Portland tonight you can hear a knee POP......
PTSup20::Still breaks my heart to see Lil' wesley in anything but a jazz uni...
aaronb528::Serves them right.
58rhodes::at least youre not  overpaying him
adrudi775::with Batums' injury the door is open for Luke Mbah the rabbit the habit Babbitt from the 775. Got to step your game up and represent kid!!
thawhiz47::Jazz &lt; Greg Ostertag
PortlandBlazers1004::6 losses by 5 or less, that hurts. I really hope Batum isn't out for the season. That will hurt big time.
Steven7355::DAMMIT GUARDS WHAT THE MOTHER ARE YOU DOING.  WHY BLAZERS WHYYYYSRIOGJDFKG
Ron3758::I have bet on sports for a few years now and have gone through handicappers like women. Two months ago I found a system sportsbettingstar.com that is pretty decent. I have only lost 1 bet so far. It is a 2 game betting system were you double down if you lose the first bet. Im 30-1 doing this so far. Thought I would post this for anyone who is looking for a good handicapper
Wombat1247::Good win by the Jazz with Bell &amp; Jefferson out - Kanter now looks like a good choice at pick 3 - long term Alot of talk about trading Harris - but what could we get for him really on the market ? - may need to package him with CJ , AL, Bell or Evans  to get value back CJ is finally showing up on regular basis - well done - he is needed as punch from the bench
58rhodes::Blazers SuC stop bragging
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::CJ is sooo good when he drives to the bucket!
dontmuchcareatthispoint::Could have done without his 0% three point shooting though...especially down the stretch. Glad the Jazz won, but he about gave me a heart attack!
joshisfirst1::I have bet on sports for a few years now and have gone through handicappers like women. Two months ago I found a system sportsbettingstar.com that is pretty decent. I have only lost 1 bet so far. It is a 2 game betting system were you double down if you lose the first bet. Im 30-1 doing this so far. Thought I would post this for anyone who is looking for a good handicapper or is just tired of BS handicappers
Kobelies247::Why cant i see anything but i can post?
58rhodes::get your head out of your moms crotch
09mckib::Because you touch yourself at night.
freeballer187::the fourth quarter was a bunch of no calls on Utah who fouled hard and often the most blatent was the Nick Batum no call...  The refs need to be repremanded and the last 8 minutes of the fourth quarter replayed.   If there was any justice in the NBA this would happen, but we all know that's all just a pipe dream.  If nothing else the league should look at this game and start handing out fines to refs for their participation in sullying the game.
dontmuchcareatthispoint::As a Jazz fan, I will say that the free throw disparity in tonights game was pretty huge.
09mckib::I'm not sure why you're so rattled.  Regular season NBA basketball is a joke.
58rhodes::and if youre a Blazer fan so do the playoffs----LOL
adamsbrian88::watch the replay batum trips over his own legs
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::HAHAHAH Batum foul??? He fell buddy! The Jazz have more heart than the blazers do. Period.
58rhodes::Utah is a lousy team and the Blazers lost----S.hit happens
58rhodes::Hes French
kgmour::The Batum no call? The guy took a bad step and his leg gave out on him. C'mon, man. Don't be such a homer. The no-call was the right call.
58rhodes::Wheres all the great stand up Blazer Fans tonight?
58rhodes::Gerald Wallace is the SuC.along with felton and crawfish
Mobsterkel::another win in SL,UT
JDub1942::Where is Salt Lake Utah?  ohhhhh, Salt Lake City, time to start paying attention in class and get the names of cities right.
Kobelies247::Another quiet night in portland! GET USE TO IT
Mobsterkel::they should move to seattle
vandalblazer::he couldn't move the blazers to seattle due to NFL rules.  he would have to sell the Seahawks first in order to do this, and he has no intention of selling the Seahawks.  Nice try buddy.
58rhodes::thats what Paul Allen is thinkin
Mobsterkel::blazers are good but they got no good pgs or bench, they are clearly on the downhill
58rhodes::Blazer fans are worse than the Blazers
58rhodes::So do the Blazers Suc?
grsshppr::Those teams are not awful so I guess we're not either
grsshppr::in fact it's better than the Lakers and San Anton
grsshppr::good one.  Our record doesn't seem to agree
grsshppr::no, and this is coming from a Jazz fan.  They just need to learn how to score in the paint or at least take it there so they can get some fouls called.  The Jazz took it inside al night and it shows.  They got a ton of calls and many were missed so the number would have been even bigger for us, but the point is that the Blazers are a good team, but have some work to do if they want to win road games.  Free throws is the key in most situations, not making every jump shot you throw up.
58rhodes::the Jazz are awful
roymullins::Batum had to be helped off the court late in the game after going down hard. ------------------------------------------------ Fraaaaaaaaaaail-blaaaaaaaaaaazers...
58rhodes::you would to if you got the contract he was offered
amiller244::The diarrhea I just let out &gt; Blazers in the 4th quarter on the road &gt; Raymond Felton
Trevor Wheelwright::You can't just blame the refs cause the Jazz shot more free throws. Quit finding excuses and deal with it, the Jazz came back and won a good game
randalls2789::I blame the blazers (not the refs) for loosing to a pathetic Jazz team. How embarrassing.
grsshppr::I guess if we're pathetic and we just beat the trail blazers then the trail blazers must be worse than pathetic
grsshppr::The Jazz are definitely not pathetic.  That would make the trail blazers a horrible team if they had just lost to a pathetic team
58rhodes::wut?
Mobsterkel::they wont make it minny will surpass them , the blazers are the king of injuries and $@%!$@ gms who waste draft picks remember when they passed on MJ and Durant what a joke
palme24::another blazers fan who thinks, like every year, the blazers are one of the best teams in the league.  potland will be out of the first round in 5 games
Rmnica23::I blame your mom for not swallowing
58rhodes::I blame your dad for watching
Kobelies247::PORTLAND = AMAZING!!!
windowlicker_son::Blake Griffin just tossed down a Mosgov dunk
Rmnica23::Jazz!!!!!!  Take that ESPN power rankings!
Doc Emmett L Brown::All right. I'm out like the fat kid in dodgeball.   The Jazz.
Hi i love my bike::*alright haha
natesweet72::Good game Jazz fans. See you next time.
JazzFanFromINDIA::Where's Rip City ?? Ohh...that guy loves the Jazz so much :P
B_McD81::As a Jazz fan, I think we have a false sense of security right now.  In Jan., we had 12 home games and like 4 road games or something.  February is a completely different story with 9 road games and 5 home games.  Go JAzz!!!!
caseygreer2::if we miss the playoffs we get a quality lottery pick in a deep draft.
EMCanada::I'd put the Jazz between 6th and 10th come the end of the season.
dontmuchcareatthispoint::For sure, despite the majority of January being at home for the Jazz, I still can't complain about where they're at presently. I'm interested to see how February goes. Go Jazz, fo sho.
clingerk::lol just like they projected up being the worst team in the league, i see us barely making playoffs and ill be happy with that
clingerk::i projected about 7th
ofaixa::Still. We were projected to finish 14th in the west. I'll take it. I don't think we are 4th or 5th in the west when all is said and done. But I now would be disappointed if we missed the playoffs.  Go Jazz!
clingerk::so did the lakers,
Doc Emmett L Brown::No sense of security. Everyone knows this.
utahraiderfan::solid win tonight with out Al. As a fan of the game i hope Batum is okay
Doc Emmett L Brown::He won't die, so in that sense, he's fine.
sjmcb160::Let One Rip City!
StockonToMalone::Man it would be cool if the coaches noticed millsap for the all star game. He's single handedly one several games for us. (I still can't see my posts by the way)
B_McD81::Millsap &gt; Every other PF in the league.
utahraiderfan::won..... but your right
utahraiderfan::d a m n good catch rofl
Doc Emmett L Brown::^^^ You're
scow79::And outplayed all of the other PF's in all-star contention
Doc Emmett L Brown::Good, because you'd see a lot of spelling errors.
grsshppr::it's grammatical by the way.  The spelling is correct but the word is wrong.
Doc Emmett L Brown::LAC is beating OKC by 18 at halftime. Jazz beat LAC by 29. Ergo, Jazz &gt; OKC.
grsshppr::those are hilarious
B_McD81::BUT.  if you buy 7 completos, its only 7 dollas.
ofaixa::But the Jazz lost to the Raptors... So Raptors &gt; Jazz &gt; OKC
grsshppr::ha ha ha.  Everybody settle down.  OKC is a great team and the Raptors record shows off their place in this very difficult NBA world.  They're not good and we had one of our worst nights against them.  Also Washington beat OKC but that means nothing except to say that anything can happen on any given night in the NBA but the Wizards still suck raw eggs
Doc Emmett L Brown::Right. I never said the equation was complete in and of itself.
scow79::It does stand to reason
JazzFanFromINDIA::natesweet72 is the only worth -talking Portland fan here....All others are idiots !!
grsshppr::It seems to me that Nate is a true fan who seems to understand the game a bit and doesn't let that cloud his judgement on who is really a good team and who is not.  @JazzFanFromINDIA your comments show your level of education.  Portland actually is a great team with a lot of talent and they worried me coming into tonights game.  I hoped we could hang and pull out a close one.  We normally don't play them all that well and they have won 3 out of the last four games.  They've always scared me.  We happened to play a great game which is nice and we got to the free throw line a whole lot more because we take it to the hole and Portland doesn't  that was our clear advantage.  Something for Portland to think about I'm sure.  A lot of jump shot = very few free throws.  Just sayin
JazzFanFromINDIA::atleast he admits that Portland are not a good team.
JazzFanFromINDIA::All others are simply , smack talking fans !
kam_moto::no he is an idiot too..
natesweet72::@kam, You can call me an idiot, but you are the one saying stupid sh*t and using racist slurs on your posts.
SEC white trash::Blazers are the model of inconsistency.
kosherkid-ute::Are you talking about people who get high all the time? Because that statement would still ring true.
SEC white trash::Yes
aaronb528::3-8 on the road seems pretty consistent to me.
SEC white trash::They beat better teams and fail against the bad teams.
natesweet72::No, they consistently win at home and consistently lose on the road. Consistent all around.
natesweet72::It's true. Last I looked only six teams had winning road records. This was two days ago.
clingerk::what are you talking about all the teams this year are losing on the road dip sh@#
natesweet72::Only if you think being completely calm and rational is equal to being mad.
kam_moto::you mad bro?
Mobsterkel::Jazz will finnish number 2 in the division, but its gonna be a tight race, portland would be alot better if they still had andre miller, raymond felton is a joke
Mobsterkel::denver is good it will be a close battle but utah i think just has too good of a bench and size
scow79::Ahead of Denver?   Surely you jest
Doc Emmett L Brown::No, Denver, then Utah, silly.
Mobsterkel::denmark or norway?
sjmcb160::I prefer Norway
Doc Emmett L Brown::^^^ Ha!
