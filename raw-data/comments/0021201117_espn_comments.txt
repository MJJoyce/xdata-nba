Bruce Bowen should be in the HoF::It looks like Popovich is gonna be going deep into the bench for the rest of the season regardless of injuries.  It might be difficult to hold onto the number 1 seed but health is more important than the 1 vs 2 seed at this point.
MRArtman2u::Lol at espn claiming the "depleted"  spurs got.past the magic... The magic are at least twice as depleted.right now as the spurs are....hello....
Ivanov21::Nando is the real deal ! he has a great all-round game ! Always grabbing some rebounds, dishing some passes....
Bruce Bowen should be in the HoF::He is more of a 1 than a 2 I think.  But I believe he is listed as a 2 on the Spurs depth chart.
Hondo Kid::spurs and orlando combined for a grand total of 22 free throws.. i guess the refs had a flight out tonite instaed of in the morning...
Nerissa2525::Good job Spurs lets beat the thunder next game go spurs go
TshimangaBiakabutuka::Harkless, Harris and Vucevic are going to be beasting for the Magic in a couple of years.
Mega_Man_::Well it's dead here going to tomorrow's board.
Trace2010::Tim Duncan has earned the right to play in San Antonio until he retires, and we owe it to him to chase deep playoff runs until that day happens.    What we're honestly holding out for is to find a successor to Tim that can allow us to make the transition while still competing at a high level.
BexyIndy55::Tim earned that right in 1999, man.  Get with the times.
luckyzac00::will be all impossible to replace timmy.  think we just got really lucky when we managed timmy and admiral for a few seasons.  not holding my breath for another piece of luck to replace timmy.  fingers crossed though
Frank1275::I find it funny how people say the spurs are old and are getting tired. They could very well be slowing down at the end of the season to save more energy for the playoffs. The Spurs were doing great at the end of the season last year and early into the playoffs, but they slowed down and eventually lost. This year may be the opposite.
Trace2010::People don't understand that we've been hearing the same stupidity from the pundits since 2008.  "Blow the team up,...rebuild from scratch.  Acquire high talent/ low IQ draft picks.  Take your lumps, spend a lot of money, and win titles."    When the one team in the NBA with unlimited resources only has 16 titles, that's a recipe for disaster.  That's just not the way we do things.  Decisions made in the front office are as much for three years down the line as this year.    All of these tough fights late in the season will help our young guys get better.  I would rather lose out the rest of the season and develop Aaron Baynes than try to enter the playoffs again with a short rotation.
Trace2010::I wonder what would happen if Pop one day looked at Boris Diaw and said, "if you have a shot, shoot."
Trace2010::Boring night in the NBA tonight.  Bunch of squash matches scheduled.
Trace2010::I like the balance of our rebounding- I have always hated watching our "solid fundamental" team fail to box out so often.  I understand they want to get into the offensive sets early, and push tempo, but gang-rebounding needs to be a priority from here on out.  This go for the ball style of rebounding is for the birds.
Trace2010::Baynes 5 rebounds- good night for minimal work.
Trace2010::I would like to see Bonner on the floor with Baynes, Mills, Neal at the two and either Jax or Diaw at the 3.    They just need to let Blair go.  I don't think he has any trade value right now.
luckyzac00::i reckon they would have had plenty of scrimmages together playing for Australia together.  just think pop needs to give baynes more time instead of maybe bonner/diaw/blair.  if they're gonna deal bonner or blair then give baynes some more game time to develop
Trace2010::Baynes needs to play with Patty Mills until he gets used to the other guys.
luckyzac00::good return for baynes agreed, but patty seemed to jack up a few too many shots.  3 for 11 not flash
jf20219::Spurs ended this one on a high note hope the momentum spills over into tomorrow Go Spurs Go!
MagicBoltzRays::back to just 1/2 game ahead the Bobcats for more ping pong balls.
Hoeesayy::Gary Neal just said he doesn't turn the ball over as much as Manu... boom!
UTRAssassassassin::no heat trolls tonight.  there must be a test tomorrow
jf20219::That and family reunion for OKC fans
TRUUUU_SPURZ::I think Baynes will play better with Manu just like Tiago does.
Trace2010::Good to see Baynes get some burn.  We're going to need one more big body at least once in the playoffs.
M for Malicious::Agreed, Manu better show up for us in the playoffs. He is starting to be a problem it seems, with the injuries and all of that.
UTRAssassassassin::450 comments   weak
Trace2010::Sorry.  Just got back from a concert tonight.  Happy the Spurs pulled this one out!
luckyzac00::i like the fact spurs don't usually generate 5000+ comments, cause 95% of those boards are just stupid trolls.  at least here, we can actually talk basketball
UTRAssassassassin::n
howdythur::I was on a plane until the second half
M for Malicious::Not so many trolls lol. I'm sure we are all ok with that.
kirt02::533

UTRAssassassassin::batman and robin is the GOAT movie  -thunder fans
M for Malicious::I'm a fan of Bayne. Hopefully they keep him and hook him up a better contract. Shows great presence in the paint.
TRUUUU_SPURZ::Duncan only played 14 min so he should be good tomorrow.
jf20219::Thunder down!
WashingtonState_SpursFan::Good win Spurs! OKC will have a slight advantage tomorrow night but it won't matter for the Spurs.
TxBANXylocaine::Is the game tomorrow on tnt or espn?

KiD.Clutch.35::Why do Laker fans think ANYONE is afraid of that team??
I hate Jerry Jones::Laker fans are delusional.
KiD.Clutch.35::Well, i suppose we all expected this.  OKC and SA neck and neck at the end of the REG.
TRUUUU_SPURZ::GG magic fans if there is any jk
Hoeesayy::"Head and Shoulders gives me a healthy scalp and hair" - Tiago
PraiseGOATKobe::Spurs dont wanna see us in the first round!      -Kobe
M for Malicious::Are the lakers even going to make the first round? Worry about that first.

TRUUUU_SPURZ::Cheer up Kawhi
rondonboss25::he's a soilder just like pops wants them...remember he's military
jf20219::Kawhi is not capable of showing emotion, that's what I like about him lol just plays hard
caseyhall410::Spurs fans, how can you gloat for beating this team?
WashingtonState_SpursFan::What Hoeesayy said. We could've very easily lost our last 5 games at the buzzer. Kind of nice to blow a team out no matter who it is.
joemcleod83::Who gloating? No one's gloating.
Mastadon-person::don't see anybody gloating
caseyhall410::"BLOWOUT!!!" and "Human Victory Cigar: Patty Mills"
Hoeesayy::because our last 5 games have been decided by a single possession
caseyhall410::My comment was not directed at you, I just responded there.
Hoeesayy::I haven't been gloating, I'm just guessing that's why
caseyhall410::So be happy, say good game and have some class like the rest of your organization.
KiD.Clutch.35::a win is a win.
caseyhall410::That has nothing to do with gloating
Daryl in San Antonio::dejuan can't even get minutes in this game!
joemcleod83::stomach flu
Daryl in San Antonio::ahh
BookValue::White mamba
UTRAssassassassin::*red
TRUUUU_SPURZ::Lol Baynes is tired,he's played the whole 4th
howdythur::He had like 9 points and 4 boards in 14 minutes loved the aggressive play too like him diving for that ball
TRUUUU_SPURZ::Thanks man I think I'm going to get it tatted on me.lol
Hoeesayy::lol love the avatar man
howdythur::It's from  tiagos new cologne line by Calvin Klein
caseyhall410::Even the Magic announcer is sick, that is how banged up our team is
Hoeesayy::LOL!
