packa83wolf4urTrip::sacramento black panthers coached by the grand dragon keith not so smart....... dude is like 20 something and 50 record wise, and just absolutely refuses to give jimmer fredette a legit shot at showing what he can do.... what an idiot.... unreal... it cant be a basketball decision.. gotta be personal
2bowdown::I'm not saying that Jimmer is a super star, but he definitely deserves more playing time.  and it is a bit suspect that every time Jimmer has a big game he ends up getting benched for the next.   The kid has value and anyone that is not biased to love him or hate him can see that.
erikthe10man::Fredette is garbage. Accept it.
Charley Varrick::Smart is nothing but a failed player himself and a bigot. Fredette should just leave. Glad Sacramento is losing and losing their team!
Jordanbetonbasketball1990-1998::Kings should be investigated for throwing games.
aaron654321142::Totally misleading headline. You would think S. Marion scored 41 in the 2nd quarter.Once again great journalism ESPN.
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Lol do u know what a comma is used for??? LOLOLOL
razzledazzletj81::Most players will dribble out the clock on their last possession and down by double digits. What does IT do? Shoot two 3's to pad his stats, what a joke.
razzledazzletj81::A.I. would often have 7+ assists averages per season. Maybe IT should aspire to that.
Only real fans stick with bad teams::I just meant the scoring part
Only real fans stick with bad teams::He could care less about his teammates he only passes to avoid a turnover. I hate Thomas, he thinks he's A.I.
pismohoops::Why is Keith Smart still the coach of the Kings????
Only real fans stick with bad teams::BECAUSE THE MALOOFS OWN THE KINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT DO THEY CARE WHO COACHES THEY'RE BAILING!!!! PLUS IF THE TEAM TANKS IT WILL BE EASIER FOR THEM TO JUSTIFY A MOVE, NOT TO MENTION SMART IS ONE HELL OF A CHEAP OPTION FOR A COACH.....SAME REASON THEY TRADED T-ROB...TO SAVE A COUPLE $$ BEFORE BAILING!!!!
Jordanbetonbasketball1990-1998::Pretty much
Issue Incorporated::John Salmons plays 26 mins, picks up only 3 points, all while collecting 8 million dollars this season?? That's an absolute embarrassment! Then you have a guy like Keith Smart, who benches Cousins, and only plays him 9 mins?? I'm done with this team! Until they can get rid of this cast of misfits, I won't be wasting my time..
Dawgman206::Just getting ready for that move up north
packa83wolf4urTrip::i wish i had ur willpower...   i have wasted two years
packa83wolf4urTrip::its criminal that jimmer fredette has still yet to receive a shot to get real starter min...... a player of the year, scoring champ, lottery pick, has yet to see a real  shot to show what he do... even tho he has been lights out in short stints...... and even tho he plays on one of the worst teams in the league, his coach still refuses to play such a scorer.... dont get it
packa83wolf4urTrip::isiah 29 points at the point.... and a whopping 1 assist..... thats a winning stat line for ur pg......
packa83wolf4urTrip::smart is a thick skulled moron... cannot believe this moron still paces a side line
Dawgman206::who is he suppose to pass to, they have nobody. Bench your best player, worst coaching staff.
Whutitdew3::isiah thomas is gonna be the point guard for this team. if evans is not gonna be here as a shooting guard, he will likely be gone next season and on to a different team
Whutitdew3::he should be a shooting guard like i said haha he plays like one.
LetsGoMavs-::Evans is a pg bro.   He's a dual threat pg that is also tall. 6'6
LetsGoMavs-::and people talk trash about Tyreke Evans and his assist  SMH
LetsGoMavs-::If Mavs don't get Cp3 or Dwight ========================= 2013-14 Lineup Dirk Tyreke Evans or Jose Calderon JJ Hickson Marion Josh Smith
willwarner12::Marion can't play SG...
Whutitdew3::idk well the backup possibilities are really good too. you can't count out cp3 and dwight joining here until the option is declined. i am tired of people not giving it a chance considering  both the clippers and lakers are not in really good shape. both howard and cp3 wanna win now and the money is not much of a difference, they just gotta take a paycut their first year here.
Whutitdew3::not really. it is not really a dream. with the mavs cap space, which is more this season, it is a pretty good possibility  esp with our lottery draft pick this season. puts the mavs in good position for next year.
LetsGoMavs-::I know we have the cap space but getting Dwight and Cp3 would be long shot considering they will get an extra 30 million if they stay with their same team
Whutitdew3::so you're asking marion to be the shooting guard lol?  calderon/cp3 evans/mayo wilson chandler dirk hickson/howard/
LetsGoMavs-::That would be an awesome lineup/backup but that is only a dream
Whutitdew3::you can't have marion and josh smith lol
LetsGoMavs-::Well if were not going to spend money on Cp3 or Dwight, then I don't see why not keeping Marion

razzledazzletj81::Wow, Jimmer gave up 117 points in 7 minutes. He is terrible at D.
1010vision::IT 1 AST!!!  9-20 FGM-A!!!! Jimmer 7 MIN 2 AST
packa83wolf4urTrip::i know right... me and my bro in law were watching him in the 5 min he was on the court,  and he was containing everything on defense... my bro in law said, I've heard jimmer sucks at defense, how come he's containing everything.... i told him its a myth.. to keep the white man down lol

Dawgman206::Wow Kings got some dumb $@% coaches, good job benching one of two only good players. Cant wait til hansen gets a hold of this team.
Dawgman206::GO SONICS!!!!
razzledazzletj81::Embarrassing jacking up two quick shots to make it to 30, sorry.
Whutitdew3::good game king fans!
LastOfTheTrueRomoSupportors::Dang! I friggen love Brandan Wright!
Kobelies247::Wow look, a team the Mavs can actually beat!  Gratz..
LetsGoMavs-::We suck this year. No one is happy
LetsGoMavs-::Mavs future pg/sg Tyreke Evans looking great  26 points
Whutitdew3::vince makes so many stupid plays during the games it is ridiculoussss
oneandonlybush1::Isaiah Thomas just looking for fouls at this point.
LetsGoMavs-::25 year old Brandon Wright = 20 points  Please resign him Mavs. Wright just needs to beef up this summer
Whutitdew3::30 freakin free throws for the kings what the heck is going on lol
oneandonlybush1::As you saw on the last play, Isaiah Thomas is just chucking it up there and trying to get fouled.
Whutitdew3::esp at denver last night did you see that game! mavs got no calls it was ridiculous. i felt like they were mugging dirk at times and the push on the back at the end my goodness
LetsGoMavs-::Refs hate Cuban so they make it hard for the Mavs
Whutitdew3::i think mavs gotta trade vince during the offseason. i cant see him play as well as he did this year when it comes to next year
flankton::lot of things wrong with Mavs... Vince isnt one of them.  drop him and free up 3M of cap space?  for what?  he led the team in assistss the last two games.  you cant trade him for much, he is a player you either sign for 3M or you let him walk to another team.
Whutitdew3::yea that is what the mavs should do.
LetsGoMavs-::For a younger player
SOONER.FAN86::Is something wrong with Cousins?
CichlidMania::He still gets paid, so I guess Cousins wins that war of words with Smart.
oneandonlybush1::he had a "verbal altercation" with keith smart and is now sitting the bench.
Lalau88::Even with the "verbal altercation" he still got more PT than Jimmer. Interesting..
SOONER.FAN86::Yeah my team is OKC but I like other players as well. Cousins is one of my favs.
0ffense::wow keith dumb fluckin over the fans and the gamblers. I really hope whoever next owners are are smart enough to get a better coach.
SOONER.FAN86::Thanks. I was worried he got hurt
0ffense::not watching but of course.   no way he'd only have 9 minutes if there wasnt.
LastOfTheTrueRomoSupportors::How the heck does Vince have 8 assists?
LastOfTheTrueRomoSupportors::Who is open next year?
LetsGoMavs-::Vince is still solid bench player for only 3 million. Mavs have him for 1 more year but should trade him if they can get a younger player. He would help a contender
Whutitdew3::if only the mavs didn't get rigged at denver last night they would have def had a chance to compete for the eighth spot
razzledazzletj81::I would like to point out the Kings starting PG has a whopping 1 assists to go with 99 points, at least he managed to stuff his scoring stat line along with one more loss.
razzledazzletj81::passing
oneandonlybush1::He only averages 4 per game, what do you expect?
JBurhenn253::The fact that he didn't start until a qtr of the way through year kinda fudges that stat a little.
LetsGoMavs-::Sad the Mavs 12 consecutive playoff appearance streak since 2000 is over :(
Whutitdew3::dang marion! showing heart! you know this guy always cares
K-WADE::hahahaha the kings were favored
Hibachiarenas::Yeah pretty crazy. Home court at the end of the season means nothing. Especially when you're playing for the 8th seed.
oneandonlybush1::Isaiah Thomas pulls the mavs player down after he falls down, lol.
Whutitdew3::i really wish webber got a ring doe. he was so fun to watch
Hibachiarenas::What are Dallas going to do with Dirk? Trade him or build around him? I can't see how they can build around him....
LetsGoMavs-::Dirk missed the first 27 games of the season. His average usually is 22 and 8 a game. This year he is avg 17 a game only cause he came back from surgery. Dirk is fine but we need him to be the #2 option  Still looking for that #1 option player to take over Dirk
Hibachiarenas::I think you guys gotta rebuild. As hard as it is, you gotta get what you can when you can. (Take it from a Wizards fan! lol)
Whutitdew3::he has done it for like 14 years
Hibachiarenas::No doubt. I'm glad he got the ring though, he and Kidd deserved it.
Whutitdew3::they are trying to make him a secondary or third option. mavs shouldn't ask him to carry a team anymore
LetsGoMavs-::NO J Mayo will never be the #1 option. I thought he would be early in the season
LetsGoMavs-::^ YUP
Whutitdew3::this is what happens when oj can shoot more. let him shoot the ball more!!
Lebrons Moms a H03::who agrees?
Bucks_fan_for_real.....::Evans Mayo Marion Nowitzki Howard
chris23562::Not unless Mayo is going to turn himself into a true PG.  Carlisle's system needs some smarts at that position
Whutitdew3::i hope the mavs don't use jim o brien's offense next year. it is hard for someone to dominate the game.
LetsGoMavs-::No J Mayo been avg only 9.4ppg for the last 12 games. Dude sucks.  Only sign him if he is ok with the 4 million dollar team option. No use of wasting extra money when we can be using it on better players in free agency
Hibachiarenas::Because ultimately you need to give the ball to Dirk, and let him make the plays....and i'm not even a Mavs fan!
LetsGoMavs-::We need Dirk to turn into the 2nd or 3rd option since he is getting older. Similar to Duncan in San Antonio. That is who Dallas is looking for. No J Mayo will never become the #1 option
Whutitdew3::vince quit shooting the damn ball youre freaking off!
LastOfTheTrueRomoSupportors::Dirk I love you but I swear if u miss another shot....
Cool Sun 13::Who would win one-on-one? kobe or Sentai Pink?
