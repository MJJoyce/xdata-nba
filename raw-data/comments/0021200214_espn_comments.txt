01Bulls4life::Good to see Chicago win a very "Convincing Win". However this is only one game... and so far they haven't been consistent at all.  Hopefully they'll find the rotations and and game play right to stay one of the top teams (long shot right now).
SoWhyYouMadBro::Rule #1: NEVER bring a reality tv star onto your team, as much as I like Lamar as a player as a person he had some serious issues off the court. you should have known better. Rule # 2: the owner of a team should be forbiden from sitting courtside during games. Nobody likes to have a "SOBB" looking over their shoulder all the time. Rule # 3: Keep your mouth shut..the dysfunctionalism continues with no end in sight. ranting on social media, ranting about refs and  David Stern doing a crappy job....sounds old and lame. ENOUGH ALREADY! Just shut up with your whining Mark Cuban and go have a seat in a luxury box or stay home
FREE_TEBOW::Tebow?????
claiborne41::http://espn.go.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/8688182/derek-fisher-agrees-deal-dallas-mavericks  -mavs secret weapon lol
getwithitson::Mavs will go as far as dirk takes them. this team is still searching for a leader that isn't on the court.
Bmarleys420::Using a system for betting called sportsbettingstar. I doubled my balance the first month and made over $3,000 a month profit the second months by using this system. You will find more about this system by searching for Sports Betting System on Google.
TheIcemanWasTheRealTopgun::Again the sandwich stuff? Why are Bulls fans so damn crazy about a free sandwich? The ticket has to cost more than a Big Mac.
PoppaVenk::what happened to boozer tonight?
TheRangerDude1.0::this is a little more in line with what I expected from a Dirkless Mavs patch work team.
Alejandra7788::This win doesn't really prove anything yet..
Carbon-based::Mavs suck
Matthew Tharp::I would agree that Nate should be starting, he brings more energy to the table.
Chi Town Stand Up::Can we all just agree that Nate Robinson should be starting...
DatGuy8921::Looked like the Bulls wanted to wash that sour taste from that Bucks loss.  Let's see if they can be more consistent now, as that is seemingly non-existent so far this year.
baruch5193::DAllas is dumb bulls are good chicago is good (city)(sports teams)
austexlonghorn::What an insightful comment.
baruch5193::yeah dude i agree!
I Got The Jokes Haha::Bull fans will probally not agree with me but I would trade Deng,Noah and gibson for Demarcus cousins and tyreke evans then in the offseason amnesty boozer sign josh smith and Oj mayo   NEXT SEASON  pg:Rose sg:Orange Juice Mayo sf:Tyreke Evans pf:Josh Smith C:Demarcus Cousinz
Robert156877::As if that's going to happen.  Trades have to be within 10%.  Even with the trade exception from Korver, it wouldn't even be close.  Besides, OJ Mayo had a chance to go with the Bulls this offseason and decided he'd rather be a backup in Dallas.
ron953::You got the jokes alright
ron953::Hahahahaha Bulls whooped the Mavs Hahahahahaha and we didn't have DRose lol!!
Arun8450::They didn't have Nowitski lol!!!
scottpilgrim33::Mavericks man. Mayo is killing us. 4 pts in 35 mins? come on man
ishnock::he's injured
BruceLee-roy1::Da Bulls! 7-7! Woooo!
Beast at Hindsight 2005 2.0::So much for the trashtalkers before the game saying the bulls would lose by 30
Brownetown26::Wow, it looks like the Bulls got some really solid play out of the bench tonight.  I have barely gotten to watch 5 minutes of basketball this year.  I will have to find some time, because Thibodeau sure does seem to get the most out of whoever is playing.
HawksCubs10::Go Bears, Go Bulls, GO MIZZOU
AdamFinesse::<b>This just in</b>: Mavericks will sign Derek Fisher tomorrow.
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::I'm out guys, enjoy D-Fish.
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::Hey the Mavs did sign Fisher
HookemHelwig::The Mavs are 28th in the league for points allowed, GEE what if we could get someone like Tyson Chandler?  What a shame and sham not to let the Mavs defend their championship, the team and fans earned it.  That is what champions do the next season.   I feel  like the Florida Marlins of the NBA
Cornelius-Mai::tonight was also a wake up call for you mayo fans when he is defended well ...he wont score ..he is not a super athletic player he is smart and can stroke the 3 but other then that its not what  the bulls need at sg they need an freaking athlete who can stroke the 3 and play monster defense and can sort of get his shot when needed ala   nicholas batum wilson chandler  and other scottie pippen ish sg/f who can play anybody on the court
J webb nation::those are small forwards dude. mayo next to rose would be sick. they wouldnt be able to focus on him. like the bulls wer tonight. although i would like afflalo more
Dallas Mavs Where Plan Z is Greater than Plan A::The haters said the Mavs  not going to make the Playoffs they may be right
CakeEsco::I like to find pictures of lesbian orgies and photoshop the 2010-2011 Mavs faces on all of the women and masturbate until my pee pee bleeds. I use no lotion. I like it raw and rough.
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tylerbball3::Lets go Colts
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::Jaguar why didn't you post that pic during the White Sox September collapse!!!! LOL
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::I had used up all of my tissues bawling my eyes out, I didn't have any left for that
Cornelius-Mai::key tonight was and i know people still wont realize this is when marco belineli plays ball handler/pg and nate plays sg ...then the bench will thrive ...im hoping when i seen  that that was something thibs has realized BELINELI IS A BEAST WHEN PLAYING AT THE TOP OF THE KEY WIT DA BALL IN HIS HANDS! great passing skills and iq ...he is not rip or korver so stop makng his fat $@% run like them
Sam58548::Mavs are now 3-8 in their last 11 games after starting the season 4-1 in the first 5 games.
HookemHelwig::Yeah Mon, and the surprise is the 4-1,,,,
tylerbball3::Aj Green &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
CakeEsco::We play Detroit Saturday. If we lose to them, I'll be in my room reminiscing on the 2010-2011 season and masturbating the rest of the season.
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::Here's a kick start for ya https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRWlRQX-jYdZHLvAsreahBMBhPtsmYZwa9G8oVxfxMfh7ooB25_Ig
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::That's the funniest thing I've read all day lol
CakeEsco::I'm going to photoshop Dirk's head on it and beat my stuff til it falls off.
dallasmavs256::Dude I think we're screwed lol better get the tissues out
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::you like Cowboys and Texans??
CakeEsco::I'm originally from Texas so it's required that I like the Cowboys, although I hate them too. Texans are good though. I hope they continue to do well this year so at least one Texas football team will do good.
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::MVP MVP MVP we Miss you!!!
tylerbball3::not going to lie, Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguars knows alot about Baskeetball
tylerbball3::whT?
Eg214::This is getting kinda $@%! for me
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::I love you
J webb nation::at least u guys didnt lose by 40 to the pistons
tylerbball3::That Hilarious
dallasmavs256::GG Bulls fans, I'm going to go back to crying until the Mavs next game
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::I've been bawling since Monday. Thank God for tonight.
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::gg Maverick fans, see you guys in late March when Rose and Dirk are back
Dtownsports4me::Hope were not to far in the hole when we get Dirk back! At this rate not looking good.
Dtownsports4me::He needs to go in that locker room and chew some $@%!$!! I know he is more vocal now and will do it.
Sam58548::Dirk is well past his prime. I dont think he can save this Mavs team.
AdamFinesse::Dirk's game barely ages. He is a pure shooter who creates space off fade-aways. I'm not concerned. He'll still be a huge impact and improve this Mavs team instantly.
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::What I've learned tonight: &gt; The Bulls' bench can be relatively decent &gt; Mavs fans are cool Good game, Dallas fans. Good luck the rest of the way!
AdamFinesse::Good games Bulls. I can't wait to see how much more you guys improve once D-Rose is back.
47riley47::All the help we need, with dp winning by 40, thats not a certain win. $@%!
CakeEsco::Good game, Bulls fans. Good look to y'all as well. Beat those dirty communist Heat $@%!$@%! every chance you get.
dallasmavs256::I love you
dallasmavs256::Haha you're right, I came on way too strong there
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::I'm sorry DallasMavs256... I just think I still love Jimmy Butler too much to start anything new quite yet.
47riley47::Cunningham is a goer, he is hot
tylerbball3::Bulls win Bulls win
Eg214::GG bull Fans My mavs seem like they have their head up their a ss
AdamFinesse::It's starting to get embarrassing how terrible we are at rebounding. Shows why we are the last in the NBA.  Dirk isn't a fantastic rebounder either, so it's really not going to improve much when he's back. We need help, badly.
boomsoon15::7th seed we lose first round
dallasmavs256::Brand needs more minutes
AdamFinesse::Brand is no where near the rebounder he used to be &amp; Kaman turns the ball over too much. Troy Murphy... enough said already.
CakeEsco::He can't rebound and can't jump. He has no legs and he's not athletic. Sarge needs more minutes.
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::The Macs are Big in the Chi tonight
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::This Bulls team could still very well get the #3 seed since our division sucks, and hey maybe if Rose comes back we get hot and get to ECF where maybe they can at least give Miami a fight
J webb nation::division winner gets the 4 seed most likely. they changed the rule
ericseg32::you guys think forman will pull off a big trade?
J webb nation::yeh i hear arenas is available
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::NO CHANCE sir
49ers_Defense-BackupQB_OVERRATED::Mavs getting an a$$ whoppen by a Roseless Bulls team
dallasmavs256::We also didn't have Lamar Odom.... LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL no I'm kidding obviously
boomsoon15::we know we suck you jackA
CakeEsco::Dirkless Mavs team. It's an even trade.
CakeEsco::Sam58548 - And I'm talking about the teams as a whole. Mavs look like they might not win 35 games this year.  Well you should keep up with the conversation because that wasn't the topic I was addressing.
Sam58548::And I'm talking about the teams as a whole. Mavs look like they might not win 35 games this year.
CakeEsco::Sam58548 - Doesnt look very even to me.  He mentioned Bulls being without Rose, I mention Dallas being without Dirk. Their both the best players on their team. That seems pretty even to me.
CakeEsco::Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar - Not totally  Pretty much. They're both the best players on their team.
Sam58548::Doesnt look very even to me.
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::Not totally
