Masta_ Da Magician::LUV IT
Masta_ Da Magician::Keep crying
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::Temple = school of reta<b></b>rds
Masta_ Da Magician::tech!!! lol
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::Temple's shot selection = LMFAO
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::what a lucky shot.
Masta_ Da Magician::skill
Masta_ Da Magician::I'm not worried about catching any team..I just want the Magic healthy and clicking entering the playoffs..They were 3rd in 2009.
l.--_--.l::Still, I'd like them to actually have a goal for the rest of the season. I don't want them on cruise control, I want them to be hungry.  Don't just settle for the 3rd seed, I'd like them to be motivated and try to get the 2nd seed.
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::who called an 8 minute scoring drought?
Masta_ Da Magician::Oh come on Bulls I want Blax to have this for longer than 2 hours!!!!!!!!!!
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::11-0 run baby!!!!!!
l.--_--.l::We'd still need major help if we're going to catch the Heat. Miami would have to lose a lot and we'd have to be nearly perfect to pass them, because we're already 5 games back of them in the loss column.
Masta_ Da Magician::Hmmmmmmmm
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::3 point game!!!!!!!!
Masta_ Da Magician::USF USF USF
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::I heard that there could be B2B's in the playoffs too.
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::bunch of damn chokers temple.
Masta_ Da Magician::lmfao
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::6 point game.
Masta_ Da Magician::I feel like if we're gonna win it all we gotta beat teams that own us.. I feel like Boston in the 1st round would prepare us for the Bulls or Heat..And if we can't beat the C's? Then we wouldn't have beat the Heat or Bulls anyway.
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::Garnett and Pierce will both be in wheel chairs by the 3rd game in that series.
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::The Kings are destroying the Celtics. they won't be a threat in the playoffs.
l.--_--.l::Atlanta and Boston just have our number. Every team has a team they have a hard time beating, even though they should be able to beat them.  I like our chances in a series against any team other than the Celtics and Hawks.
l.--_--.l::Umm, the Celtics will be a threat to us, should we face them in the 1st round.
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::If I get banned what happens then?
Masta_ Da Magician::You gotta make other acount that says this.. duh
l.--_--.l::Make the same name with underscores.
l.--_--.l::F<i></i>ucking Boston and Atlanta are such pains in the a<i></i>ss. I frekin' hope we get the 76ers or Pacers, otherwise we'll most likely lose in the 1st round.  I'd like to have the 2 seed, so we can have home-court against Miami in round 2. I feel if the refs called a fair series, we could even beat Miami if they had home-court, but it'd still be nice to have home-court.
Masta_ Da Magician::I wouldn't doubt USF going in a drought
Masta_ Da Magician::Hmm

My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::back down to 8
My name is Blax and Masta is my daddy::8 minute scoring drought by USF would be nice.
