3FL::Coach Carlisle is doing a great job keeping the minutes low for the older legs. And going deep in the bench should give him more combos for different match ups.
Tritonmoon::Not only do they miss Hollins, they miss Gay and it  seems as though they have  just given up! That's too bad cause they were such a fun hard working defensive team who were a nice threat to the finesse western conference teams. Goes to show not all owners and managers know what they are doing.
carl::Memphis suck!
Commenter::MEM is the perfect example of WHY you don't let the best coach you've had in the HISTORY of your franchise, walk.....OK, Hubie was good to but he never guided them as far as Hollins did.....fro SOME franchises it seems MONEY is more important than WINNING
Jonathan::is leuer gonna start over koufos or what?
doug::When is this Dave Joerger experiment going to be over with!!! "GRIT and Grind", defense and team play left with Lionel Hollins!!! Jason Levien has put his stamp on the team, what a idiot!!!
reddyteddy::This is going to be ugly... Memphis barely have enough players to fill out the roster....
Anton::Mavs are looking good wow...
maestron::Where the F is Brandan Wright? Scoring bigtime previously then getting benched in a blowout. SMH
Brian::Dallas rules!!!
