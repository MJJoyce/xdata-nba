Thablueprint18::LMAO I wonder where these COCKY bulls fans are HIDING right now after TANKING ever since this win while LOOKING UP at the heat going 66-16 for the season then being BLOWN OUT by the mediocre NETS! Oh wait let me GUESS, "aaaaajdhfnfoo we F*CKING DIDN'T HAVE ANY ROSE SO WERE BETTER THAN YOU" or "AAAAAAAAAA REFS!!!!11"
Roger Goodell must go::I didn't see this coming.
Lebron has one ring lol::Kobe is better
TheSixthHeatle::You tools had a lot of venting to do by the looks of this board, now back to reality and another playoff loss in the 1st or 2nd round.
geeman217::Nothing more amusing than a-  "Butt Hurt"  Heatle...  For you mopes sake, I hope you don't get the Celtics in the 1st round. Lords Knows no one to see Bron POUTING and running off the Court like he did Wednesday and like he did(while) in Cleveland.  The suicide rate(amongst) KOKA- ROACH  Heat fans might spike-wildly as well...
MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00::Heat fan calling someone else a tool???? LMAO!!! Oh the hypocrisy!!!
JWayMac42::NICE BULLS WIN  Now lets hear from the 6'8" 285 lbs girl LeBron  THE QUEEN James!  Let me calculate my thoughts real fast before I say (what I want to say)," James said. "I believe and I know that a lot of my fouls are not basketball plays. First of all, Kirk Hinrich in the first quarter basically grabbed me with two hands and brought me to the ground. The last one, Taj Gibson was able to collar me around my shoulder and bring me to the ground. Those are not defensive ... those are not basketball plays.  You elbow knock down smaller players and dunk then mean mug for ESPN (TMZ of Sports) laughing it up.  Now when someone touches THE QUEEN it's a travesty.  Heartless and soft you could not play in Jordan's heyday,  THE QUEEN is not man enough.
MrBull23::WE made you cry in the locker room and now we stopped your unimpressive streak! hahahaha!
Pepsolman::We are part of it when we pay for their arena and contracts.
killereevan12::So you must be on the team? we?

Dclayallday::this just in. your an idiot
betteratlifethanyou::Heat-refs=bobcats
dro1964::Never again my son-LBJ  David Stern
TRUESFONE::Oh it's gonna happen again daughter !!!! - me
1522scooter::Im glad we got to read the story about how the Bulls played great with Boozer absolutely owning the ENTIRE Heat front court on the glass by HIMSELF instead of some lame-$@% trumped up NON-story about phantom flagrant fouls that did NOT even happen. Nothing says bias like a bunch of crap like that.
Frank1275::Thank you bulls! Glad it's over!
colosportsman::Thanks Bulls...don't have to hear about that damn streak anymore
JORDAN 6 LEBUM 1::Someone want to pass a box of tissues to Queen James who was obviously butt hurt by the hard fouls.  Call us when you win seven titles, chump.   M-Jeff never cried about getting fouled like you do, you sissy.
ChippewaDave::Just wanted to pay my respects to Tom Boerwinkle.  He was a rock for the Bulls in the middle for years.  For those of you that never saw him play, he was a great defender and rebounder and was one of the best passing big men the game has ever seen.  RIP big guy.
Domowild::2nd best streak in the NBA... love or hate the HEAT, that is a fact... pretty impresive...
Pepsolman::Luck and playing scrub teams is not impressive. Crying to the officials is not impressive. Losing to the Mavs is not impressive. Winning during a lockout season is not impressive. The Heat as a team... is not impressive.
Dclayallday::luck is all
Beanslams46::I like win streaks, but not when they are manufactured by the officials.
tripledouble916::sounds like lebron is used to the 2nd best title hahaha
Chester0128::Miami streak was not impress as the Houston in 2006.... ** they have to come from behind to beat a bad Philly team ** they were barely survived by Boston without Keven Garnett ** they just survived in Cleveland without kyrie irving  *** they lost to the short hand Bulls without Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose and Richard Hamilton Any team in the NBA can beat those teams not just Miami....
Pepsolman::Luck and playing scrub teams is not impressive. Crying to the officials is not impressive. Losing to the Mavs is not impressive. Winning during a lockout season is not impressive. The Heat as a team... is not impressive.
killereevan12::That's why they dont?
The_Great_Red_Flash::Derrick Rose needs to man up  - Royce White
gtaatmiami::as a Heat fan im relieved the winning streak is over.  I don't want the Heat to push hard every game.  We have to be healthy for the post season.
surfzone365::That was a great game. It was a war last night. I felt that way when the Blackhawks' streak ended.  You're right, postseason time is the time to be on point.
Brian47834::the heat got beat up. tackle basketball is the best. man up lebrick
NASH_10::Great job Bulls. You PUNKED the Heat on national tv :)
surfzone365::Uhhhh....go Bulls! ;)
jimmygbuckets::Who else is happy LeBron James did not get to perform his idiotic shut the crowd down with his hands pushing downward and stomping his foot? He thinks he's a king with that.
Notta Lespn1::bottom line on that one play is bron picked up his dribble too soon limiting his options placing his fate in the will of the defender and or the mercy of the ref! last time i checkd mike was the only one taking off from the freethrow line!
smallpaul006::No Rose, no problem!
betteratlifethanyou::98% of the time teams play better without their "star" players
Notta Lespn1::where was that logic last year bulls vs.philly in playoffs with the emerging evan turner? what a fake groundhog day for 76er fans
3767fsd::ever notice last year in the finals how the heat would always try and take a charge whenever. OKC had a decent chance at a layup.  God that was boring to watch.  Every single fuckingtime an opponent has a chance at beating them near the end of the game. they take a charge. NBA should ban charges
Notta Lespn1::rose"i dont mind missing allstar week" . oohhh he's ssoooooo wrong it should be a privelege and a honr he thinks he is better than us.  me"why is lebron under .500 in the allstar game?" well they dont really care about that game  which one is it?
David722249::Refs cost us the game - Heat fan.
Dclayallday::you are sooooo lame
dabulls2012::same refs that called LeBron for ONE very obvious foul and that was it all night...
David722249::Both teams typically get screwed during a game by a non-call. To blame any loss on refs is not facing the fact that other controllable factors were butchered by your favorite team e.g., missed free throws, turn overs, etc.
KGBeanie Baby::Michael Jordan - what a mook!
Notta Lespn1::So when Rose said he didnt mind missin allstar weekend it was sooooo wrong? but when i mention lebron is severely under .500 in the all-star game with the game is deemed as unimportant?  cake and eat it too nite?
Notta Lespn1::Loul Deng, A. Iverson etcand any other number of players are just a few whistles away from being as good as LBJ, KObe etc in today's "popular perception rules" game!
Notta Lespn1::Proof that bron doesnt make talent around him better can be found in his  below .500 allstar game record. and if that game doesnt matter then why would you want to see him in the dunk contest anyway?
jmatthews117::Are you serious? You think they take that game as seriously as real ones?
Notta Lespn1::no! obviously he thinks its a waste of time but he is just afraid to voice his opinion like D.ROse did!
Notta Lespn1::the bulls are able to play the same style regardless of personel basically at least! lebron playing out of position constantly is actually a system killer. if he went down who would fill his role as the forward who dominates the ball but doesnt compete in the skills challenge or list himself as a point guard on the allstar ballot to continue the heat success? the heat would be lookinsimilar to the cavs in 2010-11 in dissarray!
ChicagoSSPride::Such a whiny baby when things dont go his way.  Unreal.  Man up.
Amado0695::Today is not the day to f.uck with me -Heat fan
Notta Lespn1::now matter how many primary scorers on one team there is still only one basketball which must be distributed properly for sucess!
Luc-Longley--GOAT::thanks coach obvious
Notta Lespn1::despite having 3 Stars and ray allen, birdman, a fab fiver, rashard lewis, and countless other players that should be starting on other teams but have sold out to ride coat tails for a piece of jewelry the heat failed to reach 100 against the bulls defense.  how did the last 3 minutes last about 30 minutes ?
Notta Lespn1::The last 3 years by the Bulls should have proven one thing to real Basketball fans: Star's don't make a team. the team makes the Star and the role player's fill in the gap.
dabulls2012::Jimmy Buckets could be a nice sidekick at the 2 for MANY years to come...probably not a star, but pretty darn good. If Joakim can maintain his level of play and Booz can keep doing his thing, the East gets a whole lot tougher for the Heat.
Luc-Longley--GOAT::last three years by the bulls proved that bulls needed another star. although last year would have been interesting if Rose would have not gone down
Luc-Longley--GOAT::Boozer just owns Lebron every time!!!
surfzone365::As annoying as Boozer's inconsistency can be, he was boss last night
dabulls2012::I just have one more comment...if LeBron couldn't keep Kirk Hinrich in front of him defensively, he better PRAY Derrick doesn't come back in time for the playoffs this year.
Notta Lespn1::what all this if such and such played in the east they would be so much better bs? if any team out west had to fly around the east for every road game they would be tired as hell with jetlag and wouldnt score as much.  i think all the xtra scoring is so east coast fans and fantasy stat lovers will be interested in the late broadcasted games sometimes starting after 10:30 pm eastern time?
Notta Lespn1::If the greatest player in the world? and in small circle some might say history?? can't get at least field goal attempt when he is 3 steps from a defender who is between him and the basket by the way what was the spin move, pull-up jumper, pull it back out and wait for teamates etc, invented for. its a sad day in basketball.   so if that play occured with .08 left in regulation and the game tied the heat win without a star even being able to get a shot of and he initiated the unwarranted contact.  what lebron fails to realize is bulls fans have seen it all before and they dont pay to see road players dunk on UNited Center rims. he should be aware of his surroundings.
dabulls2012::What about the Bosh quick pass when 5'9" Nate Robinson had him one-on-one in the paint? Talk about a total pansy...between that play, allowing Kirk to rip the ball away from him, getting just 4 boards all night as the tallest player on the floor and getting posterized by Jimmy Buckets...OH MY! Good thing the Heat only have him for 3 more years and well over $60 million!!!
ScalabrineSwag::he is just a wimp...thinks he deserves every single call.
surfzone365::The Bulls just need to keep a "nothing-to-lose" mentality.  Just play hard, smart, and have fun this season.
surfzone365::not this season...hopefully Im wrong. I want him to come back when its right...too much riding on his future
ScalabrineSwag::i dont think he is coming back either.
ScalabrineSwag::we can contend if everyone gets healthy in my opinion
ScalabrineSwag::you think rose is coming back
surfzone365::yeah, that's a big "if", but you're right....im looking forward to next season where we can get back to where we should be, health-wise.  I'm enjoying the rest of this season anyway.  i think we can make some m=noise this year still...
