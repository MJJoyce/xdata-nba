91Gmoney9009::As long as Zaza is our center, we will never be a relevant team. And look up inconsistent in the dictionary, there will be a picture of Jeff Teague. He will have a 25 point 6 assist game and then have a 5 point 1 assist game. I know alot of you Hawks fans like Teague but we need a PG. One that is averaging 8 or 9 assists a game, not 4.
onthemic79::There are bigger issues than Teague.  We paid a 6th man like he was LeBron (JJ), we have Josh Smith who is electric at times but forgets that he can't really shoot and should play power basketball, and we have a PF (Horford) playing Center.  I love Al, but we need to trade Josh Smith, since no one will take the Johnson contract, tell Marvin Williams to take a hike, and start from scratch.  The only way the Hawks are getting out of this one is by blowing the team up, hoping for a lottery pick, and starting all over.  I hate that thought as much as any other Hawks fan, but ultimately, this team is going nowhere...
acohn22::Simmer Simmer Simmer, Teague is still young and developing.  The reason he is inconsistent is because Hinrich is now taking minutes away from him, and we are getting killed so the scrubs play the whole 2nd half while Teague sits the bench.  When the Hawks are in a game, Teague plays big minutes (40 minutes) and puts up very good point guard numbers, but when they are getting blown out, he plays 20 minutes.
acohn22::What's funny is we got these Suns fans making fun of the Hawks, and they are 10-14!  Atleast we are going to the playoffs.  You beat us, and it's like you guys just won the NBA championship.  Get real.
DeVi0uZ::Suns first round lo...oh wait
chooch0706::first round loss u guys stink!!!!!!!!
WhyUHatin47::HOW BOUT THEM HAWKS!
mmyer98::Come on Suns, Nash can't do everything himself!
nickf1190::happy birthday Steve Nash!
outlawjoseywhales1981::The Hawks are a joke.
Ruby6381::2m 33s and both teams only score 2 points, and the game is only 11 point game... ATL give up the game or VEGAS call over for UNDER set at 189.5... if i was the coach down 11 with 60s left, i will foul the worst freethrow shooter out there and try to hit a 3 then foul again... but i guess thats how the game is.. give up
J-SMOOVE2020::Our management wont get us a big.  We dont have Horford or Collins right now, so I expect things to spiral out of control pretty soon.
onthemic79::Same 'ol sorry @ss Hawks.
darrell1292::7  f  ing  free throws  ,  the whole   f ing game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   the blind  a*s*s   old fart ref's  S U C K !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   the suns should sue the  mo-fo's     nba sucksssssssssssssss
CandySparker::Hola Lotta Love!
DeltaHedge::Max Joe Johnson--17 points!!!  That's some big numbers for all that money he's bringing in!!!  2011-12 $18,038,573 	 2012-13  $19,752,645 	 2013-14  $21,466,718 	 2014-15  $23,180,790 	 2015-16  $24,894,863
dabulls2012::JJ signed the biggest contract of all the big free agents from 2010...oh ya, and he's NOT getting any younger either.
phil2357::the Hawks would do well to try and keep Nash in Atlanta.......
phil2357::the good Canadian Kid, Nash, PWNS the Hawks..:)
patheisterkamp::Vlad looked so promising at the start of the season what happened? it seems he is playin more PF now when he was playin a lot of SF while Horford was still there.. maybe we need to toss him in at SF during the times Ivan comes in at power? he could shoot over anybody at the SF position then. I dont know if they did at all, i missed this game but that seems like a logical thing judging by the start of the season
jayreed2309::nash for mvp
AZwildcatz4life::word up
Madhouse_United::Atlanta can beat any team on their best days. However they can lose to any (and I mean ANY) team on any given day.
onthemic79::Which makes them mediocre at best.
Forkitout24::Nash for MVP!! All Star candidate for sure.
Forkitout24::Frye still sucks!! He needs to do that more than once for me to throw out kudos.
arizonasting001::I remember some troll on here was saying the Suns would be lucky to win 10 games this year... hmm. Guess we are lucky then.
cleb976::I remember that...and he called us stipid for thinking otherwise. Interesting how things play out isn't it?
AZwildcatz4life::lol its not like were the bobcats or something
GOGO9625::GOOD JOB NASH
GOGO9625::Never know, I've been reading that Knicks are gonna fight for Nash at the end of his contract so if this were to happen Nash and Amare and Melo???
falconsfan0125::Dude still got it. Too bad he won't ever win a championship
sjoephil69::AZZZZZ
Zach4panthers::Who would have thought that Michael Redd still has some game in him
GOGO9625::he is actually doing good this season...
AZwildcatz4life::people who watched him 2 days ago
AZwildcatz4life::oh ok
Zach4panthers::I meant his whole season in gerneral
AZwildcatz4life::well the Suns won and I dont have anything to do but spark up some herbs
arizonasting001::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-8c4zD40fg&amp;feature=share Most underrated point guard in the history of the game; Kevin Johnson.
papipizza5225::In the name of the Father, the Son, and the ultimate destruction of Sarver... I'm out. See you Suns fans
AZwildcatz4life::Nash and Frye played really well.
brandonlee561heat::Come on ATL, cant rep the Southeast division like that!
atlhawks27::soon as horford went down the hawks was playing greast but not the best they can play when joe johnson and josh smith started to not score 20 points a game the hawks started to slump when twin went down we look like a under 500 team
falconsfan0125::its now just one. game, its three HOME losses in a row
brandonlee561heat::Its just one game, at least you didn't lose to Milwaukee like the Heat did lol. Any team can win on an given night. Oh well. Losing Horford was big that's for sure.
JOE CARLS::one step closer to just having a middle round draft pick..........that SUCKS!! i dont wanna end up with another robin lopez i want a legit top 10 pick
JOE CARLS::thats why i want a top 10 pick cuz a draft this deep u would be bound to get an allstar caliber player in the top 10 for sure
waltermercier::the team has some talent, they need a pure scorer that Nash can feed the rock to though.  Like when they had Stoudemire.
AllaboutthePHO::This draft is deep as heck so I'm not too worried, I want to see morris and gortat play well and the team competes
Demonjoe93::Well... at least we only lost by single digits. :(
Demonjoe93::Yeah, when I turned this game on we were losing by 20 points.
joespreads::what the fu..ck was that last crap shot
atlhawks27::thats a good thing to be honest
arizonasting001::Lakers lose. Suns win. Boom. Solid day, GG Hawks.. Go Suns!
HawksCubs10::F"ing A Hawks.. I had Over at 190!
AZwildcatz4life::Suns are 20-5 last 25 against the Hawks
falconsfan0125::Good game suns
atlhawks27::good game suns time for the hawks to get bashed some more one espn
AllaboutthePHO::Kobe was 1-10 in the fourth quarter today? EWWWWWWWWW
AllaboutthePHO::He had decent stats though
papipizza5225::oh well at least nash is still ridiculous
papipizza5225::that kills my fantasy points Damnnnn
imhungry13579::whoever thinks the starters shouldnt have come back in is stupid.  they got the game within reach, then u put the starters in to finish the job.  instead, nothing improves and the tired bench players suck it up
imhungry13579::coach needs to be fired ASAP
PKfalconshomer::ball game - congrads Suns - good luck the rest of the way
arizonasting001::NOOO... Marcin needs one more rebound!
HawksCubs10::Wow I NEED 4 F/ing POINTS!
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::leander making it sound like its a 1 point game "hanging by a tread, up by 11" hahaha
PKfalconshomer::Come on Hawks!
AllaboutthePHO::Channing actually is clutch, I remember watching him hit big shots last year
llamclean::I agree, a lot of people seem to forget the number of games last year he won for us.  Not sure what's up this year so far but it's good to see him have a game like this.
AZwildcatz4life::when hes in a zone its crazy
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Wow, I've posted 2109 times under this profile.
Forkitout24::congrats dude!!
Joeschmo loves Heat::Why did this get liked?
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Go to an ESPN forum
AZwildcatz4life::idk why so many of you hate Frye.. hes played really well for us for like 3 years and this is the first time hes struggled
JOE CARLS::no he played well last year , look back at Frye's career he has always been inconsistent throughout but last year he just had a great year and this year he has played like the Frye of the rest of his career
llamclean::Not true, he's had good years in AZ.  Struggled early in this jacked up season though.
AZwildcatz4life::disagree
waltermercier::he jacks up too many shots.  he should play more physically.
papipizza5225::he is a big man playing like a small man
llamclean::That's why he came here, that's what they're asking him to do.  Last year he had really good rebound avg, tonight was a good example.  They ask him to roam the arc to spread the floor, he hits threes, last year one of the league leaders, how does a guy grab offensive rebounds by doing that?  He doesn't.  But all the people who don't want to pay attention to what the team is asking him to do just say "he needs to play like a big man".  Frustrating...
arizonasting001::Game over.. all 15 Hawks fans can depart through the northwest exit. Thank you.
HawksCubs10::COME ON... 4 points here
Los suns::haha of all people; channing seals is for us
arizonasting001::Channing Frye is more clutch than LeChoke. lmao
Orange602::Channing Frye. Clutch.
ARIZONAFAN4EVA::hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaa
