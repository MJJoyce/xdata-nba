Sportsbettingstar.com::The Denver Nuggets got off to a very slow start on Friday and are stumbling on their six-game road trip. The Nuggets will look to pull back over .500 on the trip when they visit the struggling Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. Denver is having some trouble with first-quarter defense in its last two games, surrendering a total of 70 points, and did not have quite enough to pull out of either hole in losses at Cleveland and Boston.  The Nuggets gave up 31 first-quarter points against the Cavaliers and fell behind 39-15 after 12 minutes against the Celtics. The Nugs have struggled they past few games but I see them getting it done here tonight.
Eddie Bonuchi::Any update on Lawson?
Darius Stevens::Day to Day. OUT for tonight, mainly because of the matchup with MCW
George Tadrosse::any update on MCW
Matt Elmore::he's "injured" so that the 76ers can begin the tanking process lol
