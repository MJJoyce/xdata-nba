njkaplan::Well we're 16 games in and folks have said that 20 is a fair assessment.  So in order for the Knicks to be .500 by the time 20 games rolled around like many of you have said, that seems...kind of impossible, unless they start counting a single loss as several losses.  So the worst they can be is 12-8 which is NOT .500 so Knick haters stole fizzy lifting drinks....you lose, you get nothing!@!! Good day sirs!  Matter o' fact, all you Meat fans are going to go nuts 'cause the Knicks will probably lose on the road to the Meat on the tail end of a back to back deal.  And btw, Carmello Anthony only scored 34 of his teams 106 points.  Everyone still talking about how much Melo sucks.  Anything else ya wanna talk about?  Where's the hate for Ray Felton or JR Smith or Steve Novak...you know...those other guys that make this team go....or what about the guy at the head of the team who's orchestrated an 18-1 record at MSG since his arrival.  Woodson is his name..correct?
Idris5249::it sucks to see my Suns fail miserably this year. no defense (as always) too many second chance points. i miss the days of stoudemire, nash, marion, johnson, barbosa, bell, diaw, J-Rich, QT, tim thomas, kurt thomas. the days when the suns went on a 15 and then 17 game winning streak in the same season....
weoutnyc::lol this is funny actually.  People who dont watch the Knicks games claiming his 27 shots yesterday were of the "ball stopping" kind.  Maybe you should watch the games and see that he is taking mostly good shots, he is also getting to the rim a lot, he gets his own rebounds and puts up another shot immediately- hence the higher number of shots.  Also, maybe you guys should look up some stats if you think he takes too many shots then so do Lebron, Wade, Kobe and Durant. All of who take the same amount or more shots per game in their careers than Melo. And all are around the same percentage of makes; making .5 more, or less, shots a game is a nominal amount when you are taking 19 or 20 shots a game as all of these guys are.
KinickDiaz::Lol at you haters........ its killing you idiots that the knicks are playing well.... making all u fools and naysayers look stupid...keep saying melo is overrated....dude been n allstar many times, an olympian many times...and will be a first ballot HOF..... Melo been a top 2 or top 3 small foward in the NBA since he came in and continues to be so. You idiots act like Melo is the first person to take 20+  shots a game....do your research, ALL STARS DO OR DID WHEN THEY WERE IN THE LEAGUE!!!.   dude is shooting a great % all round .......your nitpicking is getting tired....why dont you idiots just sit back n enjoy good ball............. or better yet keep doubting...keep hating.... you are the ones looking stupid cause the knicks keep winning!!!!
nba is the worst::Bricks per game leaders this season:  1. Monta Ellis 10.87  2. 'Melo 10.63  3. Westbrick 10.50  4. Gay 9.87  5. Harden 9.81  6. Klay Thompson 9.63  7. Kobe 9.53 8. Bargnani 9.50  9. Kemba Walker 9.0
WapoHeatFan::Heat FTA 30 per right?
nba is the worst::?
KinickDiaz::liking your own comment doesn't count fool
JosephMcGreal700::Hey Melo! Is there a player in the NBA that does not think that if they get the opportunity to launch it 27 times in a single game, that they can make 11 of them? You sure do have an inordinanat amount of 11-27 and 11-28 games in your career. What makes you so special? I rather give the shot to the post man or to a cutter or to a 3 point specialist like Novak than to you and your assorted slop from the field. Way overrated you is pal!
KinickDiaz::Man these fools dont know anything about basketball....
RNYC::Career 45% shooter. I like those numbers.
KinickDiaz::Everyone's a GM ....everyone knows what Melo will do to the Knicks...Everyone nows what will happen in June...smh....Just shut up already
ToledoMan::Yeah, dude is a serious ball stopper.  That kind of play will get them blown out in the playoffs.
BXwarriorBX::12-4
ApookTheDestroyer::34 points on 27 shots. I'll take it every day.
