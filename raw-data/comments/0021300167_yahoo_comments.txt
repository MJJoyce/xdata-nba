Rico M::Im gonna keep saying this.. Somehow someway the Bucks should just give up Milwaukee and move to Seattle and then bring the Grizzly to the Eastern Conference where they belong.. This will at least give the East another good team to compete. The East right now is just plain horrible and getting worst.
Jumbotron::We'll know in a week if they are for real. Bulls, Warriors and Thunder up next week.
P.D.::Why is Giannis not playing, I am starting to dislike this coach. Giannis is one of the players I would like see get more playing time. I don't understand why this stoopeed coach is not doing it. Play Giannis you moron. You have a bunch average players, he's the only one that has that potential to be an all star.
Jumbotron::Btw they don't make the schedule given to them and so far their SOS is 4th or 5th among the top 8 teams in power rankings...also, they've only handed the Spurs their only loss of the season. They deserve a little credit that's for sure. The next 10 games will be a good test.
PKM::No reason to think Bucks will win.
BHK::Ekpe Udoh has to be related to Larry Drews. There is no way that he should be getting over 10min per game in this league...start..............HENSON
acenando::time to fire the gm and let go of oneal ridnour zaza udoh delfino all these guys are lame and bring in the ex coach from memphis
mark::The Bucks roster is absolutely loaded with all-star caliber talent! I'm surprised they ever lose a game! This team should have gone 82-0! It's just a matter of time before they run off a 40 or 50 game winning streak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cyril::0 points, 0 rebounds, 2 turnovers, 3 fouls.  More like Ekpe Uh-oh.
Loosie::will the blazers ever actually play any decent teams?!?!
