Dsk954::dear wolves management--  please sign Pek to a contract extension ASAP.  thanks, a wolves fan who is sick of waiting
Dsk954::also, AK needs to be here next year as well
sydbjj::6-18 so far this year- Wolves are really showing some major progress- MN sports are tough to watch right now
MinniWolves90::Bench shot 5-22, not good at all. We need Shved to break out of this slump. Need Gelabale to play more, and need Johnson to PLAY.
rleroy1967::Cause the Wolves aren't very good after half-time.  Kind of like Gophers except Gophers aren't good before half-time either. lol
MinniWolves90::I just KNEW we were going to choke this one away. We damn sure tried to, luckily Philly couldn't take advantage. Great to see Pek have a KLove-esque night, and Derrick has been so impressive lately. I'm not ready to give up on him.  FREE CJ!!
mnsportswopwopwahhh::Just trade Love and keep the rest of the team together
VikingsRavensMN::..... I hope you are joking.. Or can we donate Barea to charity or something..
jeff050578::Pekovic was only 10 assists away from a triple double.
hmacphilly::I hate my life. Philadelphia sports teams are sadening... and i watch every game and sulk at the end. its really bad for relationships i been taking it out on the wife for a couplde years now im a sorry s.o.b
jeff050578::Eagles should be better and Phillies pitching is too good to have 2 bad years in a row. Isnt it?
mazwine::The 76ers are an awful uninspired team and andrew Bynum has not played one minute
Dsk954::some analysts are saying he'll never play a minute as a 76er...
Beanslams46::Need more Bynum, gotta have more Bynum.
YOURE A TOWEL::Sixers went form best bench in the NBA last season to worst bench in the NBA this season. Congratulations.
Minnysota Vikings::Well, 2nd worst bench. The Blazers bench is historically bad.
glitter thompson::Nice to see Derrick Williams start to even slightly resemble a high draft pick. Really hope we keep Pek, good centers are hard to come by and he's turning into one of the best.
Brickyyy Rubio::6 turnovers is okay bricky! you will do better next time
Brickyyy Rubio::bricky for 2!!!!! brickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Brickyyy Rubio::1-4 brickyyy done it again!
Minnysota Vikings::11 points on 4 shots. I'll take that any day.
AustinBeal::Sorry Kobe, but AK-47 is the coolest nickname in the NBA
MinniWolves90::Go Wolves!
karelp::Wolves actually have a better record than last year even though Love has missed most of the year...that's progress.
VikingsRavensMN::Garnett, what's up your a33.. I mean you have nothing good to say ever..
GarnettMoss::I guess you don't read  GarnettMoss we won, yes.................    sorry I was away..    Pek went off..    Looking forward to a WILD win tomorrow as well
Minnysota Vikings::GarnettMoss, if we can't afford Pek, sources say that he'll leave in a sign and trade. So hopefully at least we won't get nothing for him.
GarnettMoss::I just wish we could have seen what PEK, RUBIO and LOVE could have been
GarnettMoss::which means a second rounder or a 1 year restricted first
Louis the III::JJ barea is reportedly on the trading block with luke ridnour. Yes!!
GarnettMoss::they turned down DWILL and  a first, idiots
GarnettMoss::I heard DWILL and  first for Millsap..  Is that true?
Minnysota Vikings::Jazz turned it down apparently
GarnettMoss::we won, yes.................  sorry I was away..  Pek went off..  Looking forward to a WILD win tomorrow as well
JohnMosbyGuy::Rubio has quietly started to play like Rubio... Pek's doing his thing.  Barring any ACL tears or knuckle pushup disasters, I'm looking forward to next year.
GarnettMoss::what, we wont have PEK next year. We can't afford him...   There is no next year
VikingsRavensMN::Are you serious? Dude we get rid of JJ and B Roy and we easily have enough for him..
rustyburg::Lavoy Allen has 15 rebounds in the three games since his 22 rebound game.  Wow...nice consistency.  If you can't do it on a regular basis, you're pointless!  He blows!
GarnettMoss::to bad he will be gone, we can't afford PEK.. the whole thing sux....  just wish we could have saw LOVE, Rubio an PEK play together more than a few games. We will never know what could have been
binkinainteasy::What do you expect from a second round draft pick?
Minnysota Vikings::Nikola Pekovic was a 2nd round pick
shahidi125::Well, that was the ugliest 4th quarter I've seen in a LOOOOONG time
xkizarux::I am out, Sixers owner needs to take care of business. Keep Holiday, Thad, and Pargo. Package Bynum and Evan for, specifically, Seraphin, and a good 2. Shop Dorrell, Jrich and Hawes for a for a good three, and back up 5, and trade Allen for whatever you can get.
xkizarux::Pargo has shown more consistency in the week he has been here than every one else on the team, save for the people mentioned, and Holiday desperately needs someone to take the load off of being a 1. Might as well keep the back up 1, and trade for other positions that need replacing or support.
ddr34858::you sound so stupid. Pargo has been on the team a week and you want t build a franchise around him
Minnysota Vikings::An interesting observation.....Stiemsma didn't play a single minute tonight even despite having a nice lead for most of the game. During the losing streak, he had been averaging 15 minutes/game consistently. Is Adelman showing once again that he doesn't know what he's doing? or has he finally realized that Stiemsma sucks?
Mittens___the cat::Adelman's probably high every game, he doesn't give a sh%# anymore about coaching.
Flash Barrett::otato623 Hahaha dude you are driving me nuts, that's why I'm saying hindsight is great, nobody knew goofball would blow his knee out bowling ______________________________________________________________________________  Why not? he blows his knees out every year walkin up and down the steps...this 7 foot dude has bad knees and drives sports cars..maybe everybody but Sixer fans was expectin him to get hurt
potato623::Ahh mediocrity...it's a beautiful thing :)
Flash Barrett::xkizarux Evan for bledsoe ______________  That definitely aint happenin
xkizarux::Fines, Evan, Hawes and a draft pick for Bledsoe.
Flash Barrett::potato623 Flash we are 3 and a half games back ______________________________   Is being 3 games back of the 8th spot good enuff to make the playoffs?
xkizarux::Sixers will make playoffs, at least it is highly likely, but that is just continuing the same cycle of irrelevance.
potato623::With the way the Bucks been playing and Bynum + Thad Young coming...yeah
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::The past 3 games Derrick Williams has been fantastic.
Mittens___the cat::yeah, but he'll find a way to screw up
philsphan714::potato623 - Odd cause Lavoy Allen sure got a ton of minutes  In the playoffs against Boston. In the regular Season, he and Vuc each averaged 15 per game. Comparable numbers, but gotta give Vuc the upperhand
philsphan714::I'm not saying, nor did say, we would be a better team with him. Not an elite team,  but to say they wouldn't have a few more wins is asinine, considering they've been out-rebounding in most, if not every game. Can't teach height
philsphan714::this has nothing to do with hindsight. You stated earlier that Vucevic sucks. I'm arguing the contrary. I don't care that he plays for the Magic. He still plays against every team the sixers play against and puts up a double double every night
potato623::He;s average, we'd have the same record with him then w/o him
potato623::Soooo.... what's the point of this?  Bynum was an AS #2 Center in the league, Vuc was a 3rd Center off the bench...hindsight's pretty nice
potato623::Hahaha dude you are driving me nuts, that's why I'm saying hindsight is great, nobody knew goofball would blow his knee out bowling
Flash Barrett::But they were betting on Bynum when he only had one good healthy year
cory hanna::K-Love for Thad young and ET
rustyburg::I'd do it in a heart beat...but Minnesota's not that dumb, are they?
xkizarux::Evan for bledsoe.
Flash Barrett::the Sixers dnt have more talent than the Wolves, so it wont mean anything
xkizarux::Thad young, are you crazy. He is the best player on this team after Holiday, and those two are the only hope this franchise has of being relevant for the next 5-6 years.
potato623::Sign me up :)
Vince Gerstein boogie man shreeda::NBA should allow fights like Hockey, i'd love to see Charlie Villanueva uppercut Kevin Garnett for calling him a "cancer patient" and oh boy, there is no telling how many highlight reels we will get to see of Metta World Peace elbowing his opponents.
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::Most NBA players are pu.ssies. Would be a slap fest.
picaac15::The best thing Sixers fans can do now is hope they tank, and root for them to lose.
xkizarux::I know, just a little more and the sixers will lose the rest of their games, unchallenged.
xkizarux::we should start Ivey, nick young, turner, wright and brown. Guaranteed failure.
potato623::Uhh we are kind of half way there :)
binkinainteasy::The thing is we're not good enough to contend yet we aren't bad enough to get a good pick. We are currently in the black hole of mediocrity.
potato623::Flash we are 3 and a half games back
Flash Barrett::Good enuff to contend? you're not even good enuff to make the playoffs
potato623::Been there for 10 years
potato623::What are we gonna do, Play Royal Ivey and Damien Wilkins more??
xkizarux::isn't that the depressing truth
potato623::We don't need to tank, we suck on our own
Flash Barrett::lol
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::Let's beat OKC Loveless!
Mittens___the cat::damn that's our next game, well it doesn't matter, Pek is going to murk and destroy OKC
i-just-ate-a-whole-bag-of-chips::who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
WeAreMN::Nikola Pekovic
picaac15::I swear to god, the Sixers are still somehow going to $@%! everything up and make the playoffs.  Still only 3 1/2 GB, I really hope this doesnt happen
xkizarux::Unfortunately, they probably will, and they will make no head way in the offseason and this whole horrible process will start again.
potato623::Why does it matter? This draft class blows
Flash Barrett::they wont make the playoffs
Vince Gerstein boogie man shreeda::They need to expand the rosters and include Closers, Foul guys, and Enforcers.
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::Enforcers? This isn't hockey.
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::Ron Artest style
Vince Gerstein boogie man shreeda::I'd love to see fights in the NBA, I want to see how tough Kevin Garnett really is.
picaac15::The Sixers are missing 3 starters if you want to look at it that way.  Richardson, Thad, Bynum all out.  2013 will be a lot better/
xkizarux::Jrich is garbage since November and Bynum can't count because we have never had him not injured. Thad is duely missed though.
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::We're getting healthier with 47 back.
philsphan714::Nik Vucevic doesn't suck.
xkizarux::I would not have traded for Bynum. He is entitled, injury prone, and flaky. Not one thing about his person meshes with the Sixers.
xkizarux::Hawes is a bit fatter, and thats about it. Nick will smoke hawes in one to two years.
potato623::Thanks again captain hindsight
Flash Barrett::But u have nothin rite now with Bynum...he's not even playing and may never play..atleast Vucevic would give the Sixers the serviceable center they need
potato623::Thats the point of the deal....2 years vs Now with Bynum  Hindsight is a great tool
xkizarux::better than any sixer 5, though that is not saying much
potato623::Guess you missed Hawes outplay him just a couple weeks back
picaac15::he's average.  You cant look at stats to determine how a player impacts a basketball team.
Flash Barrett::I've seen him play a few times this year
potato623::He's okay, but he's all the Magic have. Same with Glen Davis, bench player on any good team.
Flash Barrett::potato623 He's a good player on a 11-30 team and a benchwarmer on a 41-41 team _________________________________________________________  He's seizing the opportunity..same as Omer Asik did
philsphan714::lavoy and vuc both played 15 minutes a game last year. Vuc had comparable, but better numbers
philsphan714::in the playoffs
philsphan714::see also- "Doug Collins never plays rookies"
potato623::Odd cause Lavoy Allen sure got a ton of minutes
potato623::Have no clue what that means, all I know is if you can't beat out Spencer Hawes for a starting job you just aren't that good
Flash Barrett::In Chicago Asik didnt get a chance to play big minutes..went to Houston and has been amzaing...Vucevic is doing the same thing..its easy to say he's good on a bad team but does Orlando really have the talent to be a good team?
Mittens___the cat::damn bro this is his second year only, have you ever heard of progress.
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::Looks like a complete game by the Wolves frontcourt. Pek, Derrick, and AK all showed up in the stats.
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::Agreed.
Mittens___the cat::to bad the backcourt blows, we would be a playoff team if we had average scoring guards.
reggie6043::God the NBA blows.
reggie6043::but seriously, how can you even watch it?
Vince Gerstein boogie man shreeda::And yet you comment on it.
jnwolters18::get off the board and dont comment then
picaac15::What other teams dont get is that  THE SIXERS HAVE BEEN THE 7 OR 8 SEED FOR LIKE 10 YEARS AND COUNTING.  Lottery Pick &gt; First Round Exit, no other way to put it.
DENIMCHlCKEN::Sickening. Sixers have no big man presence. Making mediocre bigs look like shaq.
888METAL888::He played against him last year.  They had similar stats against e/o in one of those games.
Kylejweinmeyer::Dwight howard said Pek is one of the toughest players to play against in the NBA. I would say that's quite an endorsement. Pek is far from average.
DENIMCHlCKEN::I can agree that hes hes having a decent year since hes put all that muscle on but I doubt he goes for 27 and 18 against a healthy bynum.
jank6708::Pek is not mediocre
LaMarcus Aldridge::That Celtics-Lakers board will be a troll/spam fest...
888METAL888::Which board isn't?
Vince Gerstein boogie man shreeda::<b>If the Sixers want to be good again, the first thing they need to do is fire Doug Collins, get an all star (who can stay healthy) to compliment Jrue, and hire Phil Jackson.</b>
DENIMCHlCKEN::This year removed doug has done a pretry good job with the team since he has been here. and considering the talent level on the current team, can you really say is doing that bad this year?
DENIMCHlCKEN::Why fire doug? Right on with the other comments though
xkizarux::Pargo didn't play for the whole 2nd half, or most of it. He is constantly out coached, and might as well be a bystander when the game is playing. Sixers need a strong, hard nosed, defensive coach.
potato623::Cause he's dumb...Pargo/Moultrie 0 minutes in 2nd half, thats a joke
xkizarux::He isn't wrong, that is a viable strategy. Collins is not good for a young team. He has no presence and isn't really that great of a coach. Sixers need someone for holiday to pass to that will consistently hit. Holiday, and Thad are good pieces, but sixers need at least two more(5 and 2).
Vince Gerstein boogie man shreeda::I need to get some attentions.
philsphan714::that's a pretty bold statement.
picaac15::Sixers options at end of 2012 season  1) Keep Iggy, be 8 seed, have 16th pick in draft  2) Trade for Bynum, take risk on injury, maybe miss playoffs, or get high draft pick.  No reason to be mediocre, I'd rather suck than be a consistant 8 seed
888METAL888::Healthy Wolves are dangerous Wolves.
VikingsRavensMN::T-Wolves would rather be an 8th seed than suck for 10 years straight..
DENIMCHlCKEN::Exactly.  They took a chance and it backfired. best case scenario now is that Bynum doesn't play all year Sixers lose a bunch of games and get a lottery pick
jnwolters18::Is Pekovic the most underrated NBA player?
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::basically, but he's making a name for himself.
MN MechaUltraSuperOmegaGeigaWolves::Wish I could have watched this, but I had something important to go to. I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED PEK DOMINATE!!! He needs to fish more often!
