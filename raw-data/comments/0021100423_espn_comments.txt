Rossi46Doctor::2011 NBA Finals... site of the Choke, part deux
29thrasher::I was going over the NBA schedule this year and realized the bulls have lost 7 games. 2 of those were by 15 pts by teams that we previously beat at home, 1 team by  40pts. Only one of those was at home by a team that had a chip on their shoulder and won because of a missed 3pt shot. 1 lost game to another team we previously beat on their HOME. The other 3 games we just didnt show up and got out played. All this happend while we had little to NO practice time, and over half of games on the road, while loosing key players to injury!!!!!! O yeah and we have never lost back to back games. I guess a few bad games makes us a bad team.. gogo and Le goat, you have just been owned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
29thrasher::Yikes?? lmao!!!
29thrasher::Kinda like your comments? I bring facts. Be a man and just walk away boy!!!!
Le-Goat::yikes
29thrasher::and you my friend have a very weak comeback.. come back when you drop your balls son!!!!
Le-Goat::There isn't any substance to reply to.  Son!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Le-Goat::What's the link for a 29thrasher to English translator?
Le-Goat::Beating good teams is overrated
Gogoberrymix6::I was going over the NBA schedule this year and realized the Bulls haven't beat a winning team in their last 25 games.  They are 0-6 in this span and actually lost 3 of them by 15+ points.  Interesting how they blow out the bad teams, but get blown out by the good teams.  This trend will be helpful in the playoffs
ttecza::I see the one hit wonder is at it again.
yardog59::Regular season rends are useless, and so are the Heat.
IlliniDave68::Still no new material, I see.  Typical.
IlliniDave68::I thought so. Everything posted by you Heat bandwagoners makes me laugh. ESPECIALLY when it's the SAME, TIRED, thing over and over and over again. It proves you guys don't really know how to talk intelligently about hoops.
Gogoberrymix6::Are we doing comedy skits?  Why get new material when my material is legit
91Gmoney9009::CJ Watson= BUST. Dude screwed my fantasy team last night.
nygiants731::bulls record is 24-7 guess what they win 24-7 thats right!!!!!
Rossi46Doctor::Bulls 64-47 against the cHeat all-time, 17-9 in the playoffs, 4-2 in playoff series wins, 6 rings. Keep trying down there in South Beach, little brother. NEXT
CyBuck1::Still waiting for a Heat fan to take up my challenge and have a real basketball conversation.  That apparently isn't going to happen, so good luck with the other thing.
tbomber2::don't hold your breath.
IlliniDave68::HATE = FEAR   I'm out.
IlliniDave68::Miami bandwagoners - BLAH! BLAH! BLAH!  Bulls fans - STATS. FACTS. STATS. FACTS.  Miami bandwagoners - BLAH! BLAH! BLAH!
lovesports3409::Heat fans keep up with the Bulls like they do their own team.That's why they're constantly trying to convince the Bulls fans that we have no chance on OUR blog. They're intimidated.
dizzled2012::Lebron is playing out of his $@% right now and WILL continue. This team is getting better. He was humbled last year and will not be denied.  This team will not be denied and will win it all this year. He will prove to all the haters that he is king when the Heat are champs.
buzzard1022::Did I miss the heats preseason championship parade this year?
IlliniDave68::Get through the playoffs, first.
CyBuck1::Nothing is a given.  Sometimes things don't go as planned.  Ask Aaron Rodgers.
tbomber2::yes yes, we heard all that last year.
tbomber2::sure sure.  here's your championship.  on to free agency.
dizzled2012::This team is different.  They're deeper and the point guards are making shots.
tbomber2::How funny would it be if thibs played the big 3 48 minutes
chicagofan68::deng actually said it would be funny if thibs played james 48, i thought it was great a player had the same thought as us.
CyBuck1::Did my post scare away the Heat fans? :)
fairandbalanced00::FACTS!   0-6 vs OVER .500 TEAMS IN 25 GAMES!                  0-5 vs THE HEATLES WITH OR WITHOUT SOME OF YOUR STARTERS, IT DOESN'T MATTER                  #30 IN S.O.S, Do you remember the last time the bulls beat a good team? LEBRON didn't played well in the finals BUT HE DESTROYED CHICAGO SPECIALLY IN THAT GAME 5 IN THE ECF, REMEMBER?? WHEN LEBRON AND WADE PUT THE FOOT DOWN ON YOU GUYS IN THE LAST 3 MINUTES OF THAT GAME??  LEBRON DOES NOT "CHOKE AGAINST CHICAGO", YOU  SHOULD BE AFRAID, I KNOW Debrick Rose is.
fairandbalanced00::Seriously, at least you guys have to admit the bulls have to beat an over .500 team to quiet a lot of doubters, even chicago fans who are not saying it but somehow may be worried.
IlliniDave68::I'll admit that IF you Miami bandwagoners will admit the Bulls lost those 6 games due in large part to injuries.
ArcusProtus::how convenient, you go back far enough to make it 0-5, but not far enough to make it 4-5.
IlliniDave68::You, sir, are an idiot.
Lomax66::I accept 4-5, and the 5 in a row to finish it off,.. and counting.
FranklinStrut::Sorry pal. They have only played 31 games!!! The Bulls have lost 7 games, 6 of those have been against good playoff teams when either Deng or Rose was out. Would we be better if we lost to the Bucks?
tbomber2::hey look it's dumb and dumber.
tbomber2::really?  that's all you got?  a gay joke?  just leave man, spare yourself the embarrassment.
jayson hostetler::are you tryin to make a move on me im not about that
tbomber2::you'd be better off calling us poopy-heads.  it would make you sound smarter.
tbomber2::and you trash talk at about an 8th grade level.
tbomber2::you aren't very intelligent.
jayson hostetler::i expect that from a bulls fan
jayson hostetler::finally a real nba fan
IlliniDave68::Why? Because he's bashing the Bulls and talking up the Heat?  REAL NBA fans talk OBJECTIVELY about hoops.  I've yet to see one of you Miami bandwagoners even attempt to do so.
jayson hostetler::what happened did the lunch bell ring
jayson hostetler::number one challange that loses to the celtics
FightingIllini3737::They won the most miserable city to live in contest according to Forbes...I guess that's something...
ArcusProtus::oh please.  don't play that game. ::cough cough:: milwaukee bucks ::cough cough::
tbomber2::when's the last time miami won something?
jayson hostetler::chi-town suppoter huh i feel so so sad for you
CyBuck1::So answer me this Heat supporters.  You have three of the best players in the league.  You SHOULD be the favorite to win the championship.  The Bulls have a rising young star in D. Rose, who basically put this team on his back and carried them to the ECF last year.  The Bulls do have depth, and a decent supporting cast, that when healthy should be able to challenge the Heat.  Are you that blind that you can't accept the Bulls are your #1 challenge?  I'm not saying they'll win, but I think both teams at full strength would be a very good series.  All this regular season non-sense about who you beat is a joke.  You can only play whose on the schedule.  The Bulls have lost some games against +.500 teams recently they could have one.  Hopefully when/if they get to full strength they'll be able to silence the naysayers.  If you can't see this you are either fooling yourself, or don't know basketball.
CyBuck1::That I spoke the truth and tried to have a real conversation but you decided not to?
CyBuck1::Did you bother to even read my post before responding?  Never mentioned the 90's.  Never talked crap about the Heat.  I'm not here representing other Bulls fans.  If other guys want to spew hate, well I think there are several Heat posters that give them reason to do so.  And yes, this team is deep, but needed Rose to carry them because other guys didn't step up and play to their potential.  I was hoping you would step up and give me some intelligent feedback. but you opted not to.
IlliniDave68::You've proven EVERYONE'S point about Miami bandwagoners, many times over already.
Lomax66::And you just proved my point.
Lomax66::The Bulls are just one of the teams in the league. Should there be fear in Florida?  You say you are so deep. But then it "1 guy carrying the team", then it's "we have injuries", then it we won in the 90s. Gets old. There are far more Bulls fans that talk crap about the Heat in these chats in general than the other way around. For as much as you people talk down Lebron, Wade, and Bosh, you guys tried your azzes off to sign them yourselves.  Truth is that the Heat have won 5 in a row against you guys and counting. Thru injuries, just like you. Now if you want to talk cRap so much every day, then learn to receive it back. I love having a normal chat on the subject. Unfortunately there is always a dumbazz Bulls fan that has to start with transparent dumb post to egg it all on.
tbomber2::<b>Lomax66 in a nutshell:</b>  Miami fans have nothing to celebrate. They have had a terrible franchise for 20 years up until they won a title in 06. Now they have a good team so they feel they need to run everyone else down. Even though they haven't won anything yet. I don't know why people think it is fun to even go back and forth with them. Waste of time and effort on all of the tired topics they present on the Bulls thread.
IlliniDave68::Agreed, sir. I'm done with them, too.
Lomax66::and yet this is exactly what you just did with this post. Moron.
tbomber2::nice try!
conlevis::great defense guys
IlliniDave68::Still 3rd in the league in ppg allowed. It was one off night.  Go cry someplace else.
tbomber2::wow!  did you know you're the first one to say that?
tbomber2::D-Rose controls the tempo of the game, normally slowing it down.  Fewer possessions = easier for defense to make a big impact.  Yes, we allowed a lot of points.  But we won... which means we scored even more.
ArcusProtus::to be fair, this is at least a real conversation prompt.  I'll bite, instead of bickering:  yes, that defense was horrible last night.  def need to step up the energy on the defensive end in order to help the offense while rose is out.  it just goes to show how valuable Rose and Hamilton are on both ends of the court.
Paul96857::Yeah it was back when Ricky Nattiel played over there. Lin was there too. http://bit.ly/xGmF3d
tbomber2::Heat fans look at this statement: <b>The bulls have played 5 games with their starting lineup</b> Now look at the league standings Now look back at this statement. <b>The bulls have played 5 games with their starting lineup</b> Now look at your team's record. Now look back at this statement. <b>The bulls have played 5 games with their starting lineup</b> Now look at who's coaching the All-Star game.
Lomax66::Bulls fans bring up the 90s. Bulls fans bring up regular season. Bulls fans know there is minimal chance of winning a ring at best. This is the obvious mindset,.. of the Bulls fan.
IlliniDave68::The past is the PAST.  Are YOU really so ignorant as to not grasp that simple point?
Lomax66::Keep grasping
ArcusProtus::if you wanna talk about these two teams for the past two years, including the regular season (the 5th win of that 0-5 you arecounting), then you have to include the 4 wins from the bulls last year, too.  THat makes it 4-5 - hardly domination.
Lomax66::Last year was these 2 teams. Not 15 years ago with Jordan and Pippen. You really as ignorant as your friends?
Lomax66::and 0-5 and counting
tbomber2::right?  talk about a double standard.  makes fun of us for bringing up the bulls past legacy, then continues to talk about last years' ECF.
IlliniDave68::Nope. Honesty's my middle name and I don't know that at all.
IlliniDave68::You keep bringing up the ECF . If you're gonna embrace the past, embrace all of it or embrace none of it.  Bulls are 17-9 all-time vs. Heat in the postseason.  That, my short bus-riding friend, is a FACT.
Lomax66::Nope. Didn't bother me last year either. We already know you'll be sitting again.
tbomber2::bulls worst odds are 13/2, best are 4/1.  still near the top.  it bothers you that we're a legitimate challenge to the title, doesn't it?
Lomax66::No you don't. You can't even be honest. You know the beat down is coming again.
tbomber2::actually there is a 25% chance according to vegas odds (depending who you believe).  we have plenty of faith in our team.
Lomax66::I heard all he really has is a mosquito bite
Lomax66::Bulls fan: Only cares about regular season.
IlliniDave68::I'm sure I those who still live there don't miss you at all, dumb-a.ss.
tbomber2::Your one opinion (which you are using more to prove a made-up point), is quickly overshadowed by the millions of people who live here and love it.  Let's not forget who is Forbes' most miserable city in the US.
Lomax66::So whats your point?  I lived and worked in Chicago downtown. It's a lame city compared to down here with things to do. I dont care who is at the game. It doesn't change the fact that the Heat are the biggest draw in the entire NBA. Period. I don't watch the crowd. I watch basketball. You guys should try it once.
IlliniDave68::Is that a (GASP!) excuse I'm hearing?  Sure sounds like one.
tbomber2::wow that's your excuse?  Reisendorf refuses to host the all star game at UC because we have <b>so many season ticket holders.</b>  Doesn't stop us from having the top attendance in the league 3 years running.
Lomax66::Only reason fans can't go is because the rich dipshItz from up north buy all the tickets when they move here. Takes them an hour just do get their walkers thru the isle.
ArcusProtus::Miami fans: not true enough fans to attend regular season games.  Only show up for front-running playoff teams in the post-season.  Yeah, buddy, you should be very proud.
tbomber2::it's a yes or no question.
Lomax66::No need. You fans show it over and over.
tbomber2::you honestly believe that?
brandonlee561heat::no one forced Rose to sit out with a toe stub.
tbomber2::if you're reta.rded i suppose it might.
jayson hostetler::dosent bulls rhyme with trolls
Lomax66::No. I like it here. It's fun watching the lower fan express hate and jealousy.
IlliniDave68::Then stop coming in here. It IS a Bulls convo, after all.  Troll.
Lomax66::Yeah, thats what we say when we come in here about you, but we still try and give you a chance anyways.
IlliniDave68::Trying to talk to you idiots is pointless.
tbomber2::I didn't realize it was only D-Rose who missed those 47 games due to injury.
CyBuck1::If you have an injury, you don't need anyone to force you to sit.  It's the smart thing to do.
IlliniDave68::Miami Heat bandwagoners - they talk s.hit because they're incapable of talking intelligently about hoops.
IlliniDave68::A Miami bandwagoner trying to put that label on anyone else is just too laughable.
jayson hostetler::trust me i hate the heat just a much as you but they are the better team last year playoffs showed that
ArcusProtus::bandwagon Bulls fans????  you do realize that we have averaged the highest attendance in the league for years, including mediocre first-round fodder teams.  Where were the heat fans when they bottomed out a couple years ago???
IlliniDave68::Last year is just that - LAST YEAR.  Also, I don't hate the Heat because that would imply that I fear them and I don't.
Lomax66::Now that is a post I respect. hard to find those from these bandwagon bulls fans
jayson hostetler::same with chi-town fans
IlliniDave68::Not even close, son. Read down a couple of posts and you'll see where I tried to talk reasonably about hoops to a particularly r.etarded member of your fan base.
jayson hostetler::who does illinios have to look up to in sports
jayson hostetler::where not in the past kid
IlliniDave68::On the contrary - some of you are in the past, the recent past, where it suits you.
tbomber2::Way more things than Miami that's for sure.  (past OR present)
Lomax66::The 90s
IlliniDave68::Yep. That's all I'm seeing from you guys.  Excuses.
jayson hostetler::excuses
IlliniDave68::True, the 90's are in the past but so is last year's ECF.
IlliniDave68::Miami Heat bandwagoners -  More lame than Tiny Tim Cratchett. More blind than Helen Keller. Dumber than Snooki. Smellier than a dung heap on a hot day.
Rossi46Doctor::Current Heat team = 0 rings
Lomax66::Current Bulls team= 0 rings
ArcusProtus::Current Bulls team celebration rallies = 0, as well (and as appropriate).  Current Heat team celebration rallies = 1.  Hmmmm....
brandonlee561heat2::When will the Cows beat a team with a winning record?
FightingIllini3737::Both?
jayson hostetler::brandonlee561heat has the only brain in this conversation
IlliniDave68::If you truly believe that, you're either him or he's giving you reach arounds.  One or the other.
Rossi46Doctor::Hmmm, changed your username, BANNED LOL
brandonlee561heat::Nope.
tbomber2::tomorrow
CyBuck1::grade school must be on lunch break
CyBuck1::Not ruining my day, and I try not to take this board serious.  Just looking to stop in and talk some hoops, but it always turn into a grade school chest thumping match.
brandonlee561heat::I did not mean to ruin your day, dont take everything so seriously.
CyBuck1::Sorry, I never called the Heat anything.  So your rational is that it's the internet?  Other people do it so I should also.  Grow up and be a leader, not a follower.
brandonlee561heat::You are very insecure kid. People call the Heat, the "Heatle's/cHeatle's all the time. Please don't cry. It's just the internet.
CyBuck1::Well you aren't even intelligent enough to ask a question the proper way.  You need to lower yourself and try to make fun of the Bulls, which is a joke.  You think "stick and stones" type name calling is going to get under my skin.  Sorry it won't.
brandonlee561heat::I asked a simple question and got 1 simple answer. You're too insecure to provide it, so I dont acknowledge your conversation.
CyBuck1::some real basketball conversation.  Show me you can bring something to the table.
brandonlee561heat::Waiting for what?
CyBuck1::still waiting
Lomax66::Yes... you better get back so you dont miss your homework report.
Lomax66::You notice how they tend to not bring that up.
IlliniDave68::We don't have to bring it up. You Heat bandwagoners constantly do it for us.
CyBuck1::IlliniDave in the house, and the voice of reason!
IlliniDave68::What's up, my friend?
Rossi46Doctor::Heat fans: "Enjoy watching the Heat in the Finals again this year?"  Um, did you Heat fans enjoy last year's Finals?   LOL
jayson hostetler::heat or thunder has the nba championship locked this year  dont like heat but so much talent  like wade and bosh really dont like lebron
IlliniDave68::@Lomax66,  Not that it'll sink in but allow me to give you a little perspective on something. The Bulls ARE deep. Why do you think they only lost to Boston by 4, without Rose, Indiana by 5, without Deng, and Miami by 4, without Deng? Bulls players have missed 47 total games due to injury to just 15 for the Heat. If they weren't a deep team, they wouldn't have gone 24-7 in spite of all that, would they? That said, you always want to have your top players suited up when you play the other top teams.
Lomax66::If you are so deep, then you shouldn't lose those games.
IlliniDave68::Knew it wouldn't sink in. Thanks for proving my point.  Now, GTFO.
tbomber2::if it weren't for our depth we wouldn't be 24-7.  nice try though.
angeide1124::For a quarterback you suck.
CyBuck1::Lomax, why don't you contribute something worthwhile to the conversation?  Or do you only know how to act like a grade schooler?
CyBuck1::Still waiting
Lomax66::Just keeping it on your level is all.
IlliniDave68::Stop acting like a jilted high school girl and actually talk hoops or leave.
Lomax66::Tomorrow night. Celtics by 12...............Cheers.
IlliniDave68::Not gonna happen.
tbomber2::they can barely beat a battered bulls team in boston, doubt they can handle the madhouse on madison
CyBuck1::YAWN
CyBuck1::Forbes magazine: Miami is ‘most miserable’ city in the U.S.     Forbes magazine didn’t think much of Miami, labeling it the nation’s ‘most miserable’ city.  Read more here: http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/02/03/2623979/forbes-magazine-miami-is-most.html#storylink=cpy
Lomax66::I feel the same. That's why I do not live in Miami.
CyBuck1::I continue to laugh at losers like Lomax who contribute nothing.  Man you are an embarrassment to this country.
Lomax66::Thank You...........And I promise to enjoy every time the Heat give you guys another beat down, which is often and continuous.
IlliniDave68::Explain the Chicago's 17-9 postseason record vs. Miami, then.
CyBuck1::If that's what floats your boat.
Rossi46Doctor::Current Miami Heat: 0 rings. Same as current Bulls team, since you Miami fans love to talk about being current. You're currently ringless LOL
Lomax66::Gotta love when the guy on WGN said that most Bulls fans are just fat people with White Castle burgers hanging from their faces.
Rossi46Doctor::link?
IlliniDave68::Wow. Witty comeback.
CyBuck1::You obviously haven't been to the UC, ever.
CyBuck1::Don't forget Scalabrine and Thibs have rings also.
Lomax66::Current Heat team shares a ring with some players. And you? Oh wait... You have the incredible,..... Hamelton!
Rossi46Doctor::I'm sure you enjoyed them last year. Oh wait...
Lomax66::Whatever... I will continue to laugh at you losers just for stuff like that. You guys are so jealous and just can't admit that you are 2nd rate to the Heat. Enjoy watching the Finals from the couch, again.
Rossi46Doctor::Wow, that's really impressive, that 2006 ring. What's that got to do with the current Heatles? More current than 2006 is the 2007 Bulls SWEEP of the defending champion Heat.  Get your spin ready, LOL
Lomax66::Actually, Wade and Udonis. That makes at least part of the team that has won recently. You guys have to borrow a hand me down from Detroit to make such a claim.
Rossi46Doctor::LOL That doesn't even make sense. Now DFlop is "sharing" a ring with the rest of the team? So is Rip "sharing" his with the rest of the Bulls?
CyBuck1::Lomax do you always talk out of your @$$, or do you have anything intelligent to bring to the table?
CyBuck1::Is this another "beat your chest" lovefest between the Miami fans/trolls and Bulls fans, or is there actual intelligent NBA talk going on?
IlliniDave68::*SHRUG*  The Miami trolls usually start it.
IlliniDave68::I wouldn't know, ace. I don't go on the Heat chats. That's because I'm not a Heat fan.
Lomax66::Yeah right. You pasty trolls are in the Heat chats every single night letting out frustrations of knowing the end will be coming again.
monkeysars4u::its fun to watch the heat and lebron fail
Lomax66::Honestly I don't think the Bulls will get past the Celts, pacers, or 76rs, whichever they face in the playoffs first.
shortmac2380::yea you didnt win what did you accomplish you beat us only to get smacked around in the next round.
Lomax66::Yep. But still whooped the Bulls. I still laugh when I think of Lebron stuffing that shot back in DRoses face at the end. What a choke job.  Fraud mvp you guys had. No chance you see that coming your way for a long time.
Lomax66::I laughed too. But it was fun playing in the finals while Bulls fans sat home.
shortmac2380::i laugh at the heat for having three stars and still no rings to show for it... thats funny stuff
shortmac2380::lmao mark cuban had a ring before lebron.
shortmac2380::saw enough dirk playing your team in last years finals too.. nuff said
Lomax66::Thats what I like best. You are so ashamed of your own teams beatdown by the Heat, that you have to use another team to make a reply. Funny stuff.
shortmac2380::really deng and watson will be playing. i doubt you will win in chicago
Lomax66::Heard the same thing last years playoffs. Nuff said.
Lomax66::Will be fun when the Heat come to Chicago and give you guys another beat down, so we can bounce you all around in here,... again.
tbomber2::celtics are garbage and we shat on them earlier this year
Robert156877::And Hamilton.
Lomax66::You all claim you have such a great team, and deep. So it shouldn't matter you have a player out.
shortmac2380::by 4 without rose. your point?
Lomax66::and they just knocked you guys on your azzes the other night.
monkeysars4u::i dont see the heat getting by the bucks honestly
jayson hostetler::bulls face another weak team and barley win again
jayson hostetler::no the bulls are feeding that to rose hoping his back gets better
Rossi46Doctor::Barley? Are you making soup?
tbomber2::miami beat toronto (9-21) by 6 points.  in miami.  s t f u
monkeysars4u::u eat paint chips as a kid?
Rossi46Doctor::Bucks
RunTheBall22::Lebron  will go down as the greatest player never to win a ring, the guy folds like a piece of paper when they need him the most and Spo is not good enough to  out coach anyone. but heat fans will always have the regular season front running from Lebron.  bein the greatest to never have a ring is the greatness I think everyone always talks about with Lebron
Rossi46Doctor::He can have a drink with Karl Malone and they can cry over their failed careers
Lomax66::He outcoached you guys in the playoffs
dizzled2012::Way to let the kings score 115 on the Bulls prized defense.  -Heat
jayson hostetler::look at the teams they played the easist schedule ever
shortmac2380::thanks.
jayson hostetler::bulls
shortmac2380::whos 24-7
shortmac2380::who won?
monkeysars4u::miami is a joke of a  city. its like being in a steam room, its hot ,humid, overcrowded and always a bunch of jews and cubans with their shirts off
monkeysars4u::its basically a different country
Lomax66::Worst part of being down here is when the fat annoying whiny voice Chicago crowd vacations down here and $@%!$@% and complains until they can find the discounts at the all u can eat buffets
tbomber2::chicagoans go to the west cost.  those are new yorkers.  you know, miami, where new yorkers go to die.
Rossi46Doctor::Losing in the Finals really hurt the Heat fans.
tbomber2::as someone already said...  Miami fans have nothing to celebrate. They have had a terrible franchise for 20 years up until they won a title in 06. Now they have a good team so they feel they need to run everyone else down. Even though they haven't won anything yet. I don't know why people think it is fun to even go back and forth with them. Waste of time and effort on all of the tired topics they present on the Bulls thread.
Lomax66::And yet you dopes have to go back to the 90s to find something positive to say about your team to compare with.
tbomber2::How about you check the league standings, then check yourself.  here, i'll even help you: http://espn.go.com/nba/standings/_/group/1
Lomax66::Oklahoma leads by percentage pts dope. Learn your sports.
tbomber2::OKC is a half game behind the bulls.  try again
tbomber2::read the post again, let the words really sink in
Lomax66::Oklahoma actually has a better record than the Bulls.
tbomber2::Heat fans <i>would</i> brag about beating us at home by 1 possession and missing key players.  *clap clap*
Lomax66::And yet the Heat still took you out.
tbomber2::We have the best record in the league <b>right now.</b>  Is that "current" enough for you?  With only 5 games played with the starting lineup, no less.
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::"Let's Go Heat!"  Boozers' Kids.............
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::They all have #6 Jerseys
Lomax66::And you know all the rest of the players kids do the same.
Rossi46Doctor::Bulls 64-47 against the cHeat all-time, 17-9 in the playoffs, 4-2 in playoff series wins, 6 rings. Keep trying down there in South Beach, little brother.
shortmac2380::rose is 23 he will have a ring before lebrick
shortmac2380::lebron choking thats cool.
shortmac2380::sat at home laughing at you guys losing
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Saw more of Lebron than D. Rose.........
shortmac2380::and looking for lebron in the 4th.
Lomax66::Not much to say. We lost. We know we lost. But we beat you. And you sat home.
shortmac2380::funny how heat fans happy they beat us in the ecf. but quiet when you say what happened in the finals
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::WE lost to the Mavs. Bulls were not EC Champs were they?
Lomax66::I am surprised Bulls brass hasn't been begging Phil Jackson to come back and try to get this desperate team back near the top.
tbomber2::feel free to show me spoelstra's COY awards and All-star honors
Lomax66::Of course you do. You showed us that last year in the playoffs with all of those spectacular plays and moves with the team.
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::He only goes to team with the best player. Jordan/Kobe. He would love Miami but The Don (Pat) won't give him that pleasure.........
tbomber2::i can answer that.  it's because we have the current best coach in the league
Lomax66::Mothers
Rossi46Doctor::The tourist bar you heard of after watching St. Elmo's Fire? LOL get back to work, lackey
monkeysars4u::there r women everywhere. get outta here with that. u prolly live 15 mins from the beach and never go
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Sorry, not McDonalds........
Rossi46Doctor::So McDonalds? LOL nice... get me a double cheeseburger, boy
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Absolutely, 11 years at State's third largest employer. Thank's for your concern though.
tbomber2::oh yeah? where? (here comes the google search)
Rossi46Doctor::Good to see you spend 1/2 your day trolling and 1/2 at the beach. Job?
Lomax66::I use to bartend downtown Chicago. You should see all the overweight pasty white chics. No wonder you have to drink so much beforehand.
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Was there yesterday, on my way today when i'm done pissing you ladies off
Lomax66::Got to love how Bulls fans have to go back 14 years and beyond to grasp at something to say.
tbomber2::lol moron that isn't me.  i can prove it by liking it and there being 2
Rossi46Doctor::They go back to about yesterday afternoon, when they logged onto espn from Mom's computer
Lomax66::You forgot to like your own post
tbomber2::miami fans will dissapear just as fast as they showed up.
tbomber2::if miami doesn't win this year you can say goodbye to the big 3.
monkeysars4u::i forgot the heat won the title last year. god miami is vain
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Or to last years ECF? Oh wait, ou girls don't want to talk about that.
Lomax66::You Bulls peeps will never enjoy a Championship season again. Maybe The Cubbies. Bulls are history. Just a good team that will never get over the fence.
tbomber2::miami fandom doesn't go back that far rossi.
Rossi46Doctor::We could just go back to the sweep in 2007.
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Better women down here on South Beach little brother
tbomber2::miami is forbes' most miserable city in the country.  nice job.
Rossi46Doctor::Is this the bikini board or the NBA, LOL
chadhenne07::if the heat cant get fast break transition offense they cant win games......they cant do it on a half court offense.....the bulls can do both ...when the heat are setting up plays on half court  both wade and james dont like playing without the ball......
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::What a problem to have. Wade or LeBron???
monkeysars4u::Lin has 30 turnovers in all his starts. hes like the tebow of basketball
Lomax66::and yet he plays far better at the PG position than DRose.
tbomber2::he's almost as good as d-rose on the bench.
monkeysars4u::well maybe hes the answer. will see
KingOfDunks::30 turnovers wont matter in wins...and thats normal for a guy who hasnt played a lick in the league and suddenly playing 40 minutes a game..of course he will turn it over a bunch. Who hasnt when they started?
shortmac2380::good comparison.
Goawayheattrolls::he's also playing teams that play 0 defense
Rossi46Doctor::Pat Riley... horrible record vs Bulls, with Knicks and now Heat
Goawayheattrolls::i want to see heat vs bulls when both rosters are all 100%
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Me too. a seven game series with Haslem and Miller healthy would = sweep by Heat...........
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Pat Riley is not coaching but I believe Miami has beaten Bulls 5 in a row???
Goawayheattrolls::bulls own riley
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Rose backside still hurt?
monkeysars4u::bosh is rondos dinosaur cousin
TheHeatAreTheBeastOfTheEast::Bosh owns Boozer............
