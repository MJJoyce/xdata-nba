Cyril::Nice to see James Johnson knocking down shots the last few games.  His shooting was the one major weakness in his game, and if his shot is finally fixed he could be a great role player. Not many guys out there who can block shots, rebound, handle the ball, guard three positions, and drain open three-pointers.
Rudy P::Sure am anxious to see Seth Curry get some minutes...the guy can shoot!
JonasH::seth curry playing anytime soon..?
Edan::James Johnson has made a huge difference so far. The 3 spot was a glaring weakness since the start of the season. (Not naming any names). Hope he continues his strong play and scoring, and that the stupid Grizzlies brass don't send him back to the D-league. How's Marc's knee?
Commenter::how does Andre Miller the reserve guard lead his teams in BLOCKS with only 11 minutes???
mark::I'm happy for the Grizz to score 120 points in a game! :D I hope Gasol comes back sooner...
David::BROTHER,BROTHER,BROTHER...............how u livin today?
bertoTubero::Bring back w.chandler in
