woodylamb::The biggest problem with the Rockets is Mchale's indecision with point guard. He really has no idea how to run his team.
sagematic::It looks like mchale's wants everyone on the team to play point guard except the real point guard
WOOPZZZ::now we know why kyle lowry didnt like mchale and asked for a trade. jlin will prob do that next.
sagematic::Thanks for the links, appreciate it.
WOOPZZZ::np. i added more.

luckywin7::stupid stupid stupid you know who.......but not lin lol
je ballew::WHY ROCKETS ARE LOSING: QUOTABLE: I've got the green light every game, it's   just a matter of me making shots and making plays for my teammates.   These last few games I've been struggling, especially with my shot. Guys  stepped up and hit some big shots, some big threes. Marcus (Morris) and Carlos (Delfino) and those guys stepped up all night. -- Harden.  2 fans like this. 1 Hour Ago · Like · Flag · Edit
JLinNASA::Does Lin get the green light too? No   -Both Coaches
whosaysstufflikethat::Am I the only one who see's that Harden is able to post so many points because of his free throws? I have never seen a player go so many times to the line like he does. His play style is to rush the basket and try to grab fouls...over...and over...and over again. He has to be by far the most boring player I have ever seen. Slows the momentum of the game every time he plays. We see right through you Harden!
rEdBuLxTaSy::HIS GAME IS SO PREDICTABLE AND ONE DIMENSIONAL THAT IT WON'T BE ENOUGH AGAINST ELITE TEAMS:):):)
Queen88022::Part III (from Lin's Tumblr)  Other points: Douglas approached Lin in the halftime shoot around and talked about something that seemed meaningful and serious. It seems they are friends to me or at least have a good teammate relationship. Every time there was a time out, Beverly would be the first and sometimes only Rocket that would go to the court to high five teammates. (The other players would wait for them to get to the bench).  Main point: Lin’s confidence is in the floor. When you see Lin “lost.” He is not lost. He just doesn’t know what to do in this team. Doesn’t know why the brought him here, or if they even want him to play his style of basketball. Seems to me Lin is fed up with this, “stand in the 3 point line role.” And not fed up as in, “I’m mad and I will prove you wrong.” More like, “What’s the point….”? I think he cares about his team, but feels unappreciated, that he can’t do anything.  As the third quarter developed you could see it in Lin’s face that he wanted it. And it was so upsetting to see him being benched for no reason because he was actually playing good in the third quarter. Which I wonder if they are doing this to trade Beverly or something. Maybe no one wanted Douglas because of the Knicks. But, maybe if Beverly gets more minutes they can get someone interested and trade him. Oh well it doesn’t matter.  As I see it, Lin won’t be Linsanity this year. This is the way the coaching staff has set it up. And that 7 game winning streak was an anomaly. The way that they used Lin at the beginning, and are using him now is going to stay unless one of two things happen. Rocket’s owner gets involved and demands change. Or a coaching staff replacement. I hope you guys enjoyed my analysis. It was really disappointing to see what I saw. And I just hope something changes soon because this coaching staff CAN ruin Lin’s NBA career.
rEdBuLxTaSy::UNTIL LIN CAN PLAY FOR HIMSELF, HE'S GONA BE A GOOD BALLBOY REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE'S IN...WHICH IS UTTERLY PATHETIC!:):):)
NewcastleFanVL::I applaud your love for Lin but you are lucky that I got time to read your comments, lol... With the emergence of Beverley, the Rox (imo) actually got four PGs ! No, Lin is not in an ideal situation where he can proceed smoothly in becoming a prominent PG. As a  die-hard Lin fan like yourself, I have this great desire to see him do well immediately, so much that I would try to single out every element in the team that is detrimental to his performance.For example, how is he gonna play well when the Rox 1) got no bigs that can play above the rim (i.e. no alley oops) 2) got a Melo-like player who almost never passes to him 3) set very little PnR plays and 4) got coaches who have little confidence in him from the get-go. So I was thinking maybe he should play for a team like Washington or Dallas.  But wait...,isn't it clear by now that Lin can only play well in unselfish, total team basketball? Now let's take a step back and see what scenario is best for him. The NBA doesn't revolve around him and hence he's the one who gotta evolve steadily to reach his potential. I say it's better for him to persevere and strive through whatever unfavorable conditions he's in and not to rely too much on certain rigid playing atmosphere to succeed.Give him time to develope into a strong all around player.At least I'll be with him during this growing pain period and when he becomes a star that can shine on any team he plays on, I will be having time of my life as his loyal fan.
Queen88022::Part II ((from Lin's Tumblr)  One side comment. Beverly is ok, he is not really good, or great or anything like that. Which still is mind boggling why they will sit not only Lin but Douglas in the bench. I don’t see anything that makes Beverly better than Douglas and of course not Lin. Yes he made a 3 in the fourth but he also missed the next one. My cousin said when Beverly made the three, “That’s why your boy is in the bench.” Later on when he missed I was like, “You see, he is not that good. Yeah he made that one shot but it’s not like he is good or really good to bench Lin and Douglas.” And I realized something. To try to make sense out of Rockets coaching staff is trying to make sense out of chaos. It just doesn’t. The only thing that you will know for sure is that Harden is going to be there no matter what. Which leads me to my next point.  Unfairness: As the season went by I started to defend McHale and the coaching staff. I thought some people were overacting. But as I watched the game there was something clear as day. At the beginning of the game, Harden had 3 blocked shots, like 3 turnovers on top of that and he wasn’t making a basket. So what happens? Well, obviously you keep Harden on, duh! But what if is Lin? Well, if Lin get’s blocked twice… you take him out, duh! Of course, this is not the main issue. The main issue is the coaches expression. When Harden forced a charge when he had an open man in the left corner the coaching staff starts clapping. When Lin was aggressive and something bad happened the reactions were totally different. More like when you think someone is bad at the game so you don’t want him to do much because you don’t trust him. And then he makes a mistake and you shake your head thinking, “why didn’t he pass it to the other guy…”? Well, that was their expression when Lin made a mistake. Needless to say, Lin doesn’t get the same treatment that Harden does. AT ALL! Lin is like that kid that you need to play with because you are missing one player but you really don’t want to play with him. That’s Lin to the coaching staff. And if there is anything that upsets me about the Rockets is this exactly. They don’t believe in Lin and today as proof of that. Not because he was benched in the fourth. But, because of the coaching staff reactions against Lin’s plays.
Queen88022::(from Lin's Tumblr)  I love reading fan posts like this: (Part I)   I WAS AT THE GAME!!   Sorry guys that was just to catch your attention. I know it might not mean much to be in a game but I was sitting behind the basket like 4 rows in (cheap tickets) and I was able to see a lot of things you can’t see in TV or unless you are close enough. This might be a wall of text but I hope you guys find it informative. I will also add links to a couple of videos I took including a fast break led by Lin and his long 2 point shot later.  Analysis: I know many of you are disappointed at Lin’s performance tonight, but probably not more than me that actually paid to be dissapointed. However, I went not expecting Lin to play great but to be able to see him live and analysis what was happening by looking for things that normally I wouldn’t be looking at.  Beginning of the game: As the game began the first thing I noticed was Lin’s style of play. I’m not exaggerating when I say that Lin’s job was just to pass the half court line and pass it to someone else. Yes! That was all he looked to do. He would be searching the court (looking around) for whom to give the ball to. And I don’t mean like, who to pass the ball to and make a play, but someone to GIVE the ball to for them to make a play. I know many of you blame Lin himself for this, that he should be more aggressive etc… But I will defer with that conclusion. I don’t think it’s Lin’s fault completly. Let me explain.  In the third quarter, even though Lin wasn’t controlling the offense completely, he looked,seemed and was much more active in everything. He got outspoken and began giving orders to different players like Asik and Morris etc… He was getting back in the game, but in a shooting foul play Sampson called Lin and began to talk to him. As he was talking Lin replied back while Sampson began walking away and said something at the end. Lin turned around and had this “whatever,” look. Not a “whatever” as in I don’t care. But more like, “You guys don’t let me do anything, whatever look.” Needless to say he was benched for the whole fourth quarter. I’m not saying it was because of that because Sampson didn’t see that but still he was benched the whole fourth quarter.  One thing I want to point out. Maybe you are thinking, “Why you say Sampson, don’t you mean McHale”? Well, no. I meant Sampson. There was one instance when I thought to myself, “Wait, who is the coach”? Because half the time Sampson was the one standing up and walking around and talking to the guys while McHale was sitting down. It seemed that Sampson was as, even more involved that McHale was. I don’t know much about coaches and assistant coaches but it seemed really weird. Does that happen often? I sure haven’t seen it.
Jason Stone Lee::If teamates could not make easy layups or open space shoots, PG willl be always looked bad. If no P n R, and teamates just standing or walking, this will lead PG turns over. Without team defence, PGs could not defend eachother if run P n R.
Jeremy Lin Underrated::Guarantee Lin is being screwed over by McHale!  :(
01.02.2013::Saw that McHale benched Lin in the 4th for Bev  The Rockets need to USE him or TRADE HIM.
ThoseWhoStayWillBeChampions1982::Started betting with a system called SportsBettingStar now for a couple of months.  I found this on the first page of Google by searching for Sports Betting Systems.
nba is the worst::Wow - harden goes 5-20 but shoots 21 ftas?  LOL!
inityminiwur::I thought Houston made a bad move by letting Daequan Cook and Scott Machado go and letting in Patrick Beverley. Houston didn't realize they had a very good second unit....if they could only give their rookies a chance. Terrence Jones was impressive when he played and yet they sent him to the D-League. Daequan Cook is a terrific 3-pt shooter. Scott Machado can weave through defense and create plays like an elite point guard. This team right now doesn't look headed for the playoffs.
walle D_ D::Not sure what u saw but jones looked lost when he played which is why he is in the d league. Beverly looks like an intersting back up for this team, plays with lots of energy. The problem is the ROckets need a veteran presence. Bring in a PF with the right skills, and a veteran outlook. (Milsap, MArion, Smith, etc.) Then let the young guys develope coming off the bench next year.
dychen::Jesus Harden is shooting 43% but nobody seems to notice?  How about passing the shot up once in awhile.
whosaysstufflikethat::last game was more like 25% - 5/20. 0% - 0/5 3pt shots.
walle D_ D::he's in a shooting slump right now, but so is most of the team. His percentage is low because he drives to the basket alot, which leads to either a foul or a blocked shot. Other teams are keying in on him which is why the rockets play much better with a scoring PF. Morris has a good game and we will win(or patterson) but are PFs are not consistant at all.
Longhorns-Texans::Who knew 43% was bad.
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::bobcats are like the Houston Texans..it will take them 10+ years just to break even with one .500 season...maybe 20 years..still can surprise you tho like Kemba did tonight...good win Rox, way to shake a slump loose!!!
great_chandell::How sad! You have so make a late-surge just to beat a team 10-30 -- SAD!
DuaneXC::Have you not watched the last couple of weeks?  Any win is a good win at this point.
Swish3And1::Lillard's dunk was just NASTY!!! And he's only a 6'3" PG.  Now why can't Lin do that.....
Jason Stone Lee::First Lin does not want to do it to take out spot light from his teamates. Second Lin has not to prove he can make it but he want to last whole season to play for Rox without injury.
brothertin9394::How disappointed things have turned!
Dawan208::Lin did last year dunk on the Wizards.  He crossed on John Wall put on the jets and went in for a slam dunk.  That's when he ran the offense.  He's not like that anymore.

whosaysstufflikethat::he get's KD treatment at the line almost every game. harden often scores more points at the line than from the field. that's our "star player" for you
DuaneXC::I'd spend more time looking at points and the total No. of field goal attempts.  If it's 1:1 or better as is often the case with Harden, that is great.
NYK199::classic dude who doesnt watch games
Bernie-I-beat-Novak-Tomic::what's so wrong about what I said?  I missed today's game but I usually catch rockets games.  It was a good thing he got so many attempts.  Otherwise the game would've been lost.  What the hell is a Knicks fan doing here anyway?  Get lost.
Dawan208::Stephan Curry should be going to all-stars.  Now that's a real point guard who is not afraid to shoot!!!!!   So young and talentive!!
colaroaster::lakers or houston
Dawan208::Both teams have no defense and coaches who can't coach defense!   Both teams look alike.  Neither make playoffs!
DuaneXC::Probably not but, I'll definitely take the position Houston is in with a winning record and the youngest team.
walle D_ D::Mchale can coach Deffense, he just knows a young team isnt ready for that yet and needs to learn offense first. Trust me he will start focusing in on it more as the  team matures.

pimphofoo@yahoo.com::Ok, I say MJ is a hack and even a blind squirrel finds a nut.
HighCase101::I thought Kemba would be too small for the NBA but i have been proven wrong this guy is the real deal
NewAges::Look like lately the coaches have tried to tight down the offense instead of defense. Rockets have been score less 100 points per game. What is happening to December run with 100 plus points?
bbears88::GM Morey hired coach Chris Finch to run the Rockets' offense. Finch doesn't believe he needs a point guard. Anyone can bring the ball up. Furthermore, the plays are mostly designed to take lay-ups and 3 pointers. This running and gunning has given the team the highest scoring average in the league.   The problem is that opponents have now figured them out. There was a post-game quote from a player that effectively said that the players were doing the right thing, but their plays were being "read".
Bernie-I-beat-Novak-Tomic::this explains a lot
timetodienow1234567::Lin is so worried about making the wrong play and being benched that he is playing tentatively. I blame the coach and the fact that he's making Harden the point. Lin can't be aggressive if he only gets the ball a few times. And if he starts shooting the ball EVERYTIME he gets the ball, his teammates won't pass it to him. This comes down to the fact that Mchale sucks.
Skatingseveneleven::Trade lin .. to anywhere ..    boring game ..
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::Terrible coaching. And Harden knows he can't be benched no matter how poorly he plays.
Dawan208::McHale will be fired
HighCase101::McFAIL
wrongcolor::Jeremy needs to man up.   He is playing like a boy scout with all his humbleness and passing the ball around.  People don't pay big bucks to see his unselfish plays. He is being selfish by not living up to his big paycheck.    Its true that Mchale su.ck as a coach, but that's no excuse not to make the shots fall.  MChale 's benching is useless b/c Lin is becoming desensitize to it.  The only way for Lin to sort this out is send him to the D_league.   Otherwise I think Lin is in the wrong profession
Skatingseveneleven::D_league .  sounds good ,  yes pls ,  send lin to D ,  he would be better stay there , got 800 M and playing in D_
pistol111847::He's in the right profession but the wrong team...  Better yet - get rid of McFail &amp; Jeremy will be fine.
timetodienow1234567::So you want him to play like AI???
bocabenny33433::there is some great insight by a poster on the Jlin fan site that was at the game. I think this says it all for those who are wondering why Lin is so passive this season.  www.jeremylin.net  In a nutshell, he is being handcuffed by the coaches from playing his style of game, and he is getting the double standard when it comes to freedom and mistakes.  LOHs will laugh ... but try reading the article before you judge ... that is if you can read.
timetodienow1234567::I think Lin should come off the bench. He should only play when Harden's out. I like both of them, but the way the offense is being run, Harden's really the point. He's playing ISO after ISO like Melo(but not as bad, yet). If Lin comes off the bench and bolsters the second unit, it's great. Or they could move Harden to the 2 and play them both. But Lin and Harden aren't meshing with the offense that's being run now.
pistol111847::So because Harden plays an average of 38-40 minutes then Lin should play 8-10 minutes?? Are you an idiot??
pistol111847::I think you're an idiot
peakarach16::Harden's number in the last 5 games.  Combined 139 min. shooting 34/136 TO 23 and 107 PTS.

inityminiwur::McHale's faith in Beverley increases. Beverley's rise has affected Toney Douglas' playing time. Lin is also in trouble if he continues his subpar game. Beverley could very well take over the starting job.

peakarach16::What about the SUPER STARS like Nash,Rondo and D. William???
peakarach16::What happen to so call great teams like the Celtic's,Net's and Laker's???
peakarach16::You don't think that Harden's wasn't keep asking for the ball most of the time when they were both on the floor in the last 8 games?
peakarach16::By the way Lin's don't get to play 35 or 40 min. per games like Harden did and Harden's was also asking for the ball at all time so Lin's can't do the thing that others PG do in the league.
Edudlufetips3::lol try it again. please make sense this time.
Edudlufetips3::don't know what you mean by 'cameras weren't on..' he has a good night here and there, he's had a consistently inconsistent year as a whole. at times it looks like he can do whatever he wants -- see the 4th quarter comeback against the mavs last week-- other times it seems like he is passing it to the other team. it has nothing to do with the spotlight... some of his better games this year were only seen by local broadcasts in smaller markets. he's not a GREAT player... if he was anyone with a brain knows ny wouldn't have let him go.
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::HE WAS LEFT ON THE BENCH FOR THE 4TH QTR!!!
Slambo12345::Possibly the coming out game for Marcus Morris. I know Morey doesn't want to make any deals before the deadline but if Morris or Patterson can establish themselves more consistently then it may be hard not to use the other as bait for a deal.
Slambo12345::Yeah I want to keep Smith. He's got some potential and he's played well. Great hustle guy and is underrated with his post D. I just don't see how we could keep Patterson, Morris, Dmo, Jones, and Smith making sure all 5 develop through some game time and become solid 4 or 5's. Jones is banging on the door in the D-league and we may as well trade 1 or 2 of them while they're growing.
Edudlufetips3::yea the team will definitely not keep that many 'too big to be sf's, too small to be c's' players. patterson has some tenure with the team, and he's probably the most overall athletic of the bunch. with morris showing he can stretch defenses with shooting ability- NEVER saw him shoot a three when he was at kansas- seems to be a regularity in houston- i think smith, patterson, and morris stay on the squad. unfortunately, havent seen jones play  real minutes since his kentucky days, but there is an obvious reason he was sent to D-league. greg smith reminds me of a much taller/stronger chuck hayes with his hustle and fearlessness. the fact that he has some touch and can hit ft's- hayes was by far the ugliest ft shooter in nba history- makes him a valuable asset.
Edudlufetips3::during the halfway point of the first half of the season (sorry if that sounds confusing) i was really impressed with the way greg smith was playing. big body that can finish around the basket, has a decent mid range jumper, and can hit ft's. wonder why he fell down on the depth chart. patterson hasn't been playing that well since the change.
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::I WILL SMASH ON LIN IF HE DOESNT PRODUCE..JUST LIKE ANY FAN SHOULD..I WISH MCHALE WOULD..HE SHOULD YELL AT LIN..BELITTLE HIM..CALL HIM CHINKY EYES..ANYTHING TO GET HIM TO SCORE AND ASSIST MORE..

Edudlufetips3::my rox have been in a slump, but whatever happens, this year is a success. the roster was a mess with like 20 guys on it in the preseason, harden was signed what? 3 days before the season started? mchale's daughter passed away, and i don't even wanna get started on the royce white situation... the lakers make the chemistry excuse every day but no one should have less chemistry than the rockets, yet they are, despite recent struggles, overachieving.   i love the pregame handshake/dance that lin/harden/parsons do. it signifies the future of this team. wish they would throw asik in there somewhere!
Skatingseveneleven::MJ ?  Michael Jackson ?  Lol ,I don't think he sings that perfect
peakarach16::LOL! Who said that Lin's was second coming of MJ???????
Edudlufetips3::'linsantiy,' etc. people expecting him to light up kobe for 40 like he did for a brief period in ny. it was all hype. real fans knew he was just a serviceable player and his production is right where i, and any basketball follower that isn't mentally challenged, expected it to be. double digit points, 5 or more assists a game, somewhat of a turnover risk nightly, but will have a breakout night once in a while. to say he's underachieving is wrong. the people who say that thought he was going to be unstoppable every game. that was my point, the mj comment was a hyperbole.
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::I hate that pre game thing because Lin is under achieving..if Lin was a great teammate, he would have more then 6 assists a game and would have a lot more points then 11.x per game..pathetic..
Edudlufetips3::i think you were one of those people that fell under the assumption that lin was going to be the next coming of michael jordan or something. he's an above average player that is at his best slashing to the basket. at the moment he's not a great shooter and a slight liability on defense (though he's improved a lot since early in the season), and will be eclipsed athletically by many nba pg's. anyone who thinks we got rid of two very solid, arguably better, pg's in lowry and dragic for lin b/c of talent is delusional.  he brings in revenue. in the end that's the bottom line.
peakarach16::By the way Lin's does't play that much and Harden was asking for the ball at all time
Easygoer8964::Royce White is a useless piece of trash crybaby.  He shouldn't even be paid a cent.
NewcastleFanVL::F &amp; B.
Easygoer8964::Superpieman802.2, I am my own boss and have been very successful.  No need for me to search for a job when I'm fairing out fantastic, but I feel sorry for the people who do want to get back in the workforce and can't find a job.  NewcastleFanVL, I don't know what business you are in but I'm happy with the staff I have.
NewcastleFanVL::@super : Not to worry, I'm the boss but then it's pretty hard to hire good workers lately.
Edudlufetips3::LOL! i said i didn't wanna get started with that! yeah i don't know exactly what his condition is like, but it's another reason why the rockets ¬.500 or better record in the west is impressive. forget the headache royce white has been, how about the squandered high draft pick that could have been used on players that were drafted later that are making an impact this year?!
superpieman802.2::its so easy to see who has 0 life other then their team.  job search not going so good?
NewcastleFanVL::I love your SPIRIT buddy, go ROX !!!!!!!!
ItsAllComingBackToMe1985::Ive bet with a system called SportsBettingStar.  Since I started, I make roughly 3K per month in profits by following the systems picks.  You can find this system on the first page of Google when looking up Sports Betting Systems.
KobeTimeFourth::Chris Paul had 4 points today too on 1 of 7 shooting in 33 minutes...just saying
peakarach16::Rondo against Piston's was 8 point on 4/16 shooting in 36 mi. and 9 TO. lol! By the way the Celtic's got rape by no name team.
Dawan208::Don't respond.  He's a troll!!!
durant.4.mvp::to be fair, Paul is injured. Lin is just playing with his normal limitations
chientah::Nope, that's still unfair to say.
durant.4.mvp::Rondo averages a double double
peakarach16::What about Rondo???
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::Bulls @ Lakers tonight!!  see a train wreck  that is a Laker loss!!
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::Has anyone even asked lin how his knee is..is it 100% yet and why no jump shot?? when you need to learn something new at Harvard community, you studied..how hard is it to practice a jump shot with boy toy chandler parsons..your buddy from Florida community college
bocabenny33433::not knee .. it's what he is being told to do by the coaches.
superpieman802.2::i love the way you trash these players like you have a life that even begins to matter to anyone but you and your mom.
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::Lin is getting spoiled and coddled on this team due to his 25 million and this kid from Harvard community college has no jump shot to speak of.  He look like he is trying to do a rainbow shot reminiscent of World B free and that guy on the warriors back in the day..what was his name, the one with the rainbow shot and played for the Warriors..
bocabenny33433::I don't think it's the money ... it's the coach's direction ... see jeremylin.net for one guy's view from the game ... great insight on stuff you won't see on TV cameras.
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::Purvis Short jump shot but Lin's clangs off the rim consistently!!
