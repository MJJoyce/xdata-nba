LilVdog88::Wall&gt;anybody on the Bobcats roster I mean MKG cant even beat an old man Jordan in bball
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Wall would more than likely get his *** handed to him by Jordan. I hate that the first thing I see is butt hurt Wizards fans when I step in this thread.
huskers-PVAMU::Are you serious? Henderson has a few good game and he is suddenly better that John Wall? YOU need some glasses.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Henderson isn't better than Wall, but he's better than Beal and has had a lot more than a few good games. He's been trapped by a poor passing system and a bad team in Charlotte, but dude is a legitimate wing defender and is growing into a scorer. I think Beal's ceiling is higher, but don't sleep on Henderson.
IFlySheep::You should invest in some glasses. Henderson and Walker are clearly better than Wall is.
batennisstud::@woyplate
batennisstud::@woyplate
-RupturedSpleen-::Probably the last win for the Bobcats this year.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Yawn.
ksmit111::It would be like sand full of sugar
Real Deal Beal::Fitting that Lebron hits a game winner...
Stephen33155::I hope Hendo stays......but with his play right now I expect a poison pill from Ainge!!
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Boston's got bigger fish to fry. They should be happy with Bradley anyway.
Indychase22897::I'm scared Kemba might want to leave soon.  What do you guys think??
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Kemba isn't going anywhere soon.
AGirlThatLovesSports_::He won't
joest2003::$@%! sounds good to me
9edr0::Kemba Wiggins (next years top pick) MKG Olynyk/Plumlee (portlands pick) Noel (this years pick)   6th man Detroit pick   a very young but very good team
9edr0::and i don't think he will want to leave....gonna get 2 more top 3 picks and 2 more lottery picks (within 3 years) to play with him
joest2003::it was 3 years then they did another year team option so its 4 total so 2 after this year.
9edr0::isn't his rookie contract like 4 years + a team option
TCluvcarpanthers::We have his Bird rights. He'll be a Bobcat for at least 8 more years.
Kujosh54321::Yea, at least 3 years if you count the bobcats matching his offer as a restricted free agent.
TCluvcarpanthers::I mean even if he wants to leave in restricted free agency we can match any offer if it comes down to it.
joest2003::8? pretty sure its 2 after this year and then it depends on what they put around him, i can see him wanting to stay with MKG and turn this thing around
9edr0::his rookie contract says no to that
TCluvcarpanthers::Matt Carroll  into  Hakim Warrick  into  JOSH MCROBERTS
9edr0::need to resign him and get rid of Mullens
9edr0::it keeps getting better lol
9edr0::throw in Mullens and Miami gets a steal
9edr0::sure sounds fair to me
TCluvcarpanthers::Josh McRoberts into Lebron?
AINOKEALLBUSUFAKAWOT::who cares about these crap teams.. Celtics are about to extinguish the Heat!!!!!!!!!!!
Tnayshuss::Go to their board then.  Bye.
9edr0::Bobcats extinguished the Celtics 2 times this year
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Who the hell was the Celtics intentionally resting the first time? Cut it out clown.   PS: Guess the Celtics couldn't extinguish a damn thing last night.
9edr0::and intentionally resting your  best players is kinda disrespectful
TCluvcarpanthers::No, if we're playing the :missing players" card, we were without our 2nd leading scorer, Ramon Sessions.
AINOKEALLBUSUFAKAWOT::because they were intentionally resting players for those 2 games.  Didn't they just redeem those losses by smashing them without Garnett?
Tnayshuss::Should we take a risk on Bynum?  I am sure he will be at a discount.  Just throwing it out there.
9edr0::i would rather have Pekovic he is a safe 15 and 10 guy can probably get him for about 13million
PartTimeHomer::Don't take Bynum. Bad attitude, bad work ethic, bad knees.  I'd actually like to see the Cats get better and the division improve over the next few years. Maybe he comes back and is a beast, but that attitude won't ever go away.
joest2003::HELL NO were trying to build not take a risk on those bum knees, we got plenty of cap space next season to get someone better. or even scoop a C in the draft
9edr0::no more than 1 year
TCluvcarpanthers::I was thinking about that, too. But, I'm afraid he won't sign in Charlotte; no matter what we offer him.
Tnayshuss::True.
9edr0::everytime Charlotte wins the other team blames the refs lol
TCluvcarpanthers::We'll trade you Kemba for Wall.  ...  ...  Sike, we'll keep the better point guard.
joest2003::Bobcats would never trade Kemba
ksmit111::Cool story bro, needs more dragons
PartTimeHomer::Must be fun ignoring career numbers.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Dispute anything in the paragraph.
PartTimeHomer::joest2003 - PartTimeHomer - 9edr0 - Kemba is in his 2nd year of course Walls career numbers are gonna be better  Just how many years do you think Wall has played, guy?  This is Kemba first year starting. and he had no training camp cuz of the lockout his rookie season there both great PGs that always get compared i dont know what you guys are arguing about  Wow! A paragraph! Anyway, there's no argument. Just discussion.
joest2003::PartTimeHomer - 9edr0 - Kemba is in his 2nd year of course Walls career numbers are gonna be better  Just how many years do you think Wall has played, guy?  This is Kemba first year starting. and he had no training camp cuz of the lockout his rookie season there both great PGs that always get compared i dont know what you guys are arguing about
9edr0::more than Kemba has
PartTimeHomer::9edr0 - Kemba is in his 2nd year of course Walls career numbers are gonna be better  Just how many years do you think Wall has played, guy?
9edr0::Kemba is in his 2nd year of course Walls career numbers are gonna be better
Tnayshuss::Henderson is balling right now!
Pauls2686::MJ is having three dinner guests for the evening. Refs are fans too.  Embarrassing game for the NBA.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
ksmit111::There seems to be a lack of whites on the wizards.. that's why they cant succeed
joest2003::AHA the Wiz fans acting like there record is so much better than the cats.
joest2003::I hear ya what would the boards be without a little trash talk.
joest2003::Im just lazy i worked all day at a computer you would be surprised how little you want to read after a 10 hour work day.
PartTimeHomer::It's just moving your eyes and not being brain dead, which I don't think you two are.  Like I said, I was just being a dick in reaction to the trolling.
joest2003::NO ONE WANTS TO READ YOUR PARAGRAPHS BUDDY SORRY FOR TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. go write a book or something
PartTimeHomer::I made a single extended comment all night and you're all getting your panties in a bunch over it. I find it amusing.  "I won't read what you're saying because it's too much to read." It takes 10 seconds, if that.
PartTimeHomer::As I point out to all the other fans of bad teams that attempt to troll, the Wizards were worse than every team in the league by A LOT. The fact that the Wizards are now up on the Cats by 9 or so games should make Charlotte fans feel really bad.  Wizards fans wouldn't even care about returning the trolling if you people could be gracious winners. These after game conversations didn't happen when we played NO or Phoenix.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::3-1 over the Wizards this year with the worst team in the NBA. Deal with it.
PartTimeHomer::TCluvcarpanthers - If he was illiterate, I'm pretty sure he'd have troubling logging onto his computer. That requires a basic level of literacy.  My grandmother can log into a computer. She's pretty damn illiterate. Also from NC, though. So.  Anyway, I was clearly just being a dick.
TCluvcarpanthers::If he was illiterate, I'm pretty sure he'd have troubling logging onto his computer. That requires a basic level of literacy.
PartTimeHomer::joest2003 - PartTimeHomer - joest2003 - This guy long $@% paragraphs, I only said that because all the Wiz fans were talking !$@% about the Bobcats record  You consider that long? Illiteracy is a serious thing.  For a ESPN conversation board?....Ya i do  Sad.
joest2003::PartTimeHomer - joest2003 - This guy long $@% paragraphs, I only said that because all the Wiz fans were talking !$@% about the Bobcats record  You consider that long? Illiteracy is a serious thing.  For a ESPN conversation board?....Ya i do
PartTimeHomer::joest2003 - This guy long $@% paragraphs, I only said that because all the Wiz fans were talking !$@% about the Bobcats record  You consider that long? Illiteracy is a serious thing.
PartTimeHomer::TCluvcarpanthers - Didn't read.  Was gazing at the SCOREBOARD  I figured you didn't read because you're from Carolina.
joest2003::This guy long $@% paragraphs, I only said that because all the Wiz fans were talking !$@% about the Bobcats record
TCluvcarpanthers::Didn't read.  Was gazing at the SCOREBOARD
nspur24::20 wins is a slight possibility. I'd have taken that before the season and called it a success.
9edr0::yea i can see 6 more wins
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Lol. I can't. But we can always hope.
9edr0::3 of Charlotte's 15 wins are against the Wiz
ksmit111::Interesting flopping going on by walker towards the end but he did pull it out.. gg cats im gonna rape that white girl on your dance team
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::We got all kind of bad ****** on our dance team. Sexiest females in the league, but popular vote over the years.
joest2003::They got away with like 3 illegal screenes on him
9edr0::Bobcats vs Wiz 2015 Eastern Conference Finals
TCluvcarpanthers::Charlotte Athletics...
catman172::One of the dream matchups in the NBA this year by far
chrisbradley35::Go Bobcats...
wadlez::holy bobcats trolls ;p hopfully the Wiz get Porter... it wwas much preferred to lose this game. GO NATS
TMack652::braves&gt;nats
GeorgeTownDC29::I dont know Charlotte might beat the Nats this year. Oh wait, no baseball team :)
34Quantherzz::Team most recently in the playoffs? Charlotte.
PartTimeHomer::JTorcasso - you act like 23-43 is much better... why dont you shut the fck up until you are in the playoffs? then you can actually have a fair argument  "TCluvcarpanthers Ignore You seem mad. 6 Minutes Ago  Like  Reply  Quote  Flag"
JTorcasso::you act like 23-43 is much better... why dont you shut the fck up until you are in the playoffs? then you can actually have a fair argument
PartTimeHomer::GeorgeTownDC29 - Was thinking more like 15-52.  Shhh. The big picture only matters if it benefits Charlotte.
GeorgeTownDC29::Was thinking more like 15-52.
TCluvcarpanthers::Record? Oh, like 3-1 against DC this year.
9edr0::no baseball team yet
GeorgeTownDC29::record.
TCluvcarpanthers::Scoreboard.
Cashmoney9320::The wizards are embarrassing.  That was real funny.
Real Deal Beal::After being down like 18...Miami is winning.
PartTimeHomer::Time to go. Bobcats fans think they just won the Superbowl.
TCluvcarpanthers::Look at the scoreboard; and have a nice night.
joest2003::I didnt know NBA had a superbowl.
PartTimeHomer::joest2003 - PartTimeHomer - Boy, that went over your head.  No, it just made no sense.  I know you'd like to think that.
joest2003::PartTimeHomer - Boy, that went over your head.  No, it just made no sense.
PartTimeHomer::Boy, that went over your head.
TCluvcarpanthers::You seem mad.
PartTimeHomer::Ah, a variation of "umad". Bullhorn of the witless.
TCluvcarpanthers::Scoreboard.
wadlez::this guy
joest2003::Good Win!
Tnayshuss::Yes indeed!!!
TCluvcarpanthers::Hey Wizards fans, YOU MAD THO? Can't even win a season series against the Bobcats....It's a shame.
Real Deal Beal::we sure did last year :)
GeorgeTownDC29::2 years in a row with the worst record is quite the feat. so jelly
ESPNaccountover9000::^ call the kettle black
steelersbobcatsredsox::wasnt it just a couple years ago you guys had the worst record? and you really havent improved since then have you?
wadlez::really indifferent tbh
pico2013::whay do popcats want to win dis game? they need to lose more and more games to win the lottery bick.
9edr0::like 5 guys could be #1 pick they dont have to get #1
GeorgeTownDC29::They got worst record on lockdown. Nobody can take that from them. MJ bound to pick someone really good either way...
steelersbobcatsredsox::i think your kid tried to use the keyboard
ESPNaccountover9000::this draft is WEAK

padsa67::Wizards = CHOKERS
okc_gambler::Wizards fans, you must all have a miserable lives for being fans of this losers
ESPNaccountover9000::Who beat OKC? Wiz
9edr0::the Wiz lost  3 times to one of the worst teams ever that is horrible
ESPNaccountover9000::Who has the record for worst win % in an NBA season? I'll let you answer that one
9edr0::who lost to Charlotte 3 times? Wiz
wadlez::lol ^
TCluvcarpanthers::Carolina sports own DC sports, lol.

ravenisthebest7::Bobcats fans taking trash...that's awesome.
34Quantherzz::Charlotte fans aren't taking trash. haha
9edr0::Charlotte fans are talking trash because Wiz fans are raging and its funny lol
steelersbobcatsredsox::its just as pathetic for wizards fans to talk trash
1cubbiesfan::GREAT COMEBACK BOBCATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
benedict_welker::wiz should have snagged lillard way more upside....fearless baller
Champ Kande::CONGRATS BOBCATS $@%!$ THE WIZ
Marek7476::Congrats Bobcats on winning a meaningless game
TCluvcarpanthers::You seem mad.
okc_gambler::The Wizards should be a D league team
PartTimeHomer::Yeah. Over .500 team in the NBA the last three months. Definitely D-league material. Clown.
Pickle_m0nster::There are 7 teams intentionally losing and its so obvious watching this joke of a display on the court.  The NBA is pretty much the WWE with a basketball and clowns as refs playing along.  The NBA should make it a real lottery and make it even odds for the 10 worst teams.   Stern should fine these teams instead of fining the Spurs who were resting their veterans during the season.  You suck nba
benedict_welker::i agree
buccodude::Cam &gt; Bob, Kemba &gt; Wall, MKG &gt; Beal, Panthers 21-13, Bobcats 3-1 vs Wizards, Canes &gt; Caps, Carolina &gt; DC

rhpatel16::Whoa Kemba
GeorgeTownDC29::How many titles does Charlotte have in major league sports? Nascar doesn't count.
9edr0::the Canes won a title (not in Charlotte but close enough)
The BatCam::not really, 2 teams that are in the same state (basically). Canes are the only hockey team in NC
ESPNaccountover9000::That's like giving DC a superbowl ring cause of the Ravens
ravenisthebest7::Let's not start that one.
StompYourFace25::Look at the box score... where is my boy Segana???
