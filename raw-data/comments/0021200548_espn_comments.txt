Mohammed58::The Miami Cubans beat the Seattle Lattes, yawn...
tbest23::Rock Chalk Super Mario! Too bad you play on a team full of chodes...
Bamm7272::Please refer to the Heat as NBA Champions.   Thank you.
flvsbsu::Thank You
Z Wade::Too bad he plays on a team full of champions!
tbest23::Yes he did win a title with classy guys @ KU. Now its the floppers and the huge egos.
scabbfan::Chalmers 10/13 from 3pt land,  Wow. If kobe ever had a game like that it would be all over the headlines for years &amp; they would be offering that as prood kobe is greatest ever....lols.  Chalmers deserves more credit, plays his role, good defense &amp; clutch when stars are covered.
Mr Knowitall 2::tbest23 No I didn't prove his point, when Kobe did it, it wasn't huge news and hasn't been brought up that often.  Obviously if it was made such a big deal by the media everyone would know that Kobe holds the 3 pt record.  I've already seen people on this post believe that Chalmers set a record.  I would be willing to bet that most people on this post know that Kobe broke the record.  Maybe you are new to the sport, I remember when Kobe broke the record and it wasn't made as huge of a deal as you would think.
Mr Knowitall 2::Maybe you weren't aware that Kobe holds the record at 12 3's in one game and made 7 straight 3's without a miss and 8 in one half.  By the way, Chalmers is and always have been a 3 pointer player, Kobe has not.  Do you think that Kobe practices 3 pointers all day like Mario? I'm trying to take anything from Chalmers, what he did awsome, very few players have every done it, and this game has seen some great players, I'm just trying to give the credit back to Kobe you are trying to steal from him.
tbest23::You actually just proved his point.
pismohoops::Tyreke Evans sucks
Kingreggie6::UD is just awful he's got the speed of a center with the atheleticism of a 400lb man and the height of a small forward and oh lord everytime he's about to shoot I just say NOOOO forget holding on to the past and being loyal to him he of what was has left which hasn't been loyal to us please retire UD or release this guy
TheWalkingDead7::Whats up with the last 2 scoring possessions of the King's trying to get to 100 points, what a bunch of twats, the Heat gave up trying to score with 1:30 in the final 4Q just chilling and the Kings trying to run up a losing effort, even ending the game with a dunk, like if the fans cared about anything but all the Miami heat highlights that night.
OILMAN1528::Skip.. In no way! Should Mario Chalmers! Be near the ball! In the 4th quarter!
scabbfan::Fail Chalmers is a great clutch player &amp; Lebron should definetly be hitting him if he is open.
Jubin3567::Why is Udonis Haslem so bad ?
_Pippen aint easy_::He's definitely not the same player he used to be. Doesn't have the same athleticism and his jumper is way off most of the time, when it used to be very reliable.
brandonlee561heat22::Ever since he got injured
Jubin3567::His jumper is broke too. He steals rebounds from other teammates if you monitor him closely, so don't believe his padded stats.
Asif11111::no clue. if he wasnt then we wouldnt have the rebounding issues which we currently have. lol
Asif11111::sup folks!
oblique15::Chalmers&gt; Ray Allen
Asif11111::last night HELL YEAH HE WAS
jblaze1986sp::Falcons and Texans win today..............BOOK IT!!!!!!
tbest23::Whooooops!!
jblaze1986sp::Lakers bout to lose to Uncle Drew tonight
Asif11111::Uncle Drew bouta go to town tonightt
_Pippen aint easy_::They will both lose.
Asif11111::How bout them lakers? LOL
Jubin3567::Nay, Natty Ice chokes in the post season
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::reasonable. wouldnt mind that at all.
HuskerNation85::Comin in hot.
Jubin3567::The ghost of Mike Miller possessed Chalmers last night
brandonlee561heat22::he was in the zone last night
Jubin3567::Sad part is I like Jorts better than Hasbeen
brandonlee561heat22::yea absolutely, as far as Jorts, I doubt they will sign him again after that 10 day contract is up
Jubin3567::I really hope they toss him some playing time...at least garbage time. His offensive game isn't shabby at all and he showed some defensive presence last night. If he can even be a decent rebounder, I'd be sold.
brandonlee561heat22::I thought he played awesome. He actually looks like he had played basketball before, unlike Pittman who looks lost like the majority of the time.
Jubin3567::What'd you think of Varnado last night ?
nhraven52::nba is the worst And with the ref help they got yesterday they could beat the pats   LOL, You go the Ref Help route for the NFL too??
Clueless Heat Fan::chalmers 10-13 n 3s gotta be a record heat need to play him more too many shots for haslem n bosh awesome win
Mr Knowitall 2::It was great, but not a record.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Lol nice name and avatar
Rob6384::<b>CHALMERS FOR 3 Bang!</b>
GaspoMinnyFan981::2-0
brandonlee561heat22::Dzeko redeemed himself
brandonlee561heat22::it was only a matter of time, City takes those quick FK's like that often
GaspoMinnyFan981::Yup
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::Woot woot
brandonlee561heat22::Who do you guys have the games today? Seatlle &amp; New England?
brandonlee561heat22::Yea I think it's going to be New England again. not sure if Flacco can beat Brady.
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::Patriots are more overrated then the broncos and the broncos&gt;Patriots anyway
nba is the worst::I'm a perfect 0-2 so far...  I tend to think Seattle and I can't see anyone picking against the Pats at home
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::Brady does not like pressure ( ny giants know that)
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::Houston's defense is similar to San Fran's defense... Both have a very good pass rush
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::Seattle 31 Falcons 24  Patriots 34 Houston 35
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::Cross my fingers
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Reasonable.
GaspoMinnyFan981::Same but I would hate to see new England in the superbowl again
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Lol well all in the interest of Ray Lewis' last year. Not really a fan of the Ravens so Im not gonna defend the officiating. But personal opinion, the Tuck rule should be abolished.
nba is the worst::And with the ref help they got yesterday they could beat the pats
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::I hate people automatically giving NE the pass to the SB. Baltimore would want revenge if they played in a rematch of last years AFC title game
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Pats. seattle..hmm. Maybe? No idea for that one.
brandonlee561heat22::Already changed for a defender
brandonlee561heat22::Would be epic if they could pull out a draw somehow
GaspoMinnyFan981::Corner
GaspoMinnyFan981::Brandon?
brandonlee561heat22::You watching soccer?
GaspoMinnyFan981::Yeah they are screwed
brandonlee561heat22::Yep, nice save Arsenal screwed now with only 10 men though
GaspoMinnyFan981::Yeah did u see that Pk
LBJFINALSMVPx1::HEAT REPEAT....
nba is the worst::"Just like they did in 2007"!
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::That'd be fun with a healthy Rose too  I know Im counting it would be
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Nah even with our p.iss poor home record we're still a 5 in the Eastern conference approaching the midway point. I expect us to not go too high up or down from this point.
oneandonlybabe::ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing - Lol its not gonna happen. We arent falling to the 8 and Miami isnt falling to the 4 or 5. Wishful thinking. Hope we play them in the ECFs  That'd be fun with a healthy Rose too
nba is the worst::Bulls could end up 7 and the heat 2 tho
oneandonlybabe::I know, no worries. You're an adoptive heat fan LOL
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Lol its not gonna happen. We arent falling to the 8 and Miami isnt falling to the 4 or 5. Wishful thinking. Hope we play them in the ECFs
nba is the worst::I'm counting on your Bulls to repeat that '07 1st rd!  It's the heat fans that are always saying the past is relevant, I'm just using their logic...
oneandonlybabe::in your own words: "The past is irrelevant"  In all seriousness they need to address their rebounding issues. Maybe Lebron can concentrate on rebounding if someone else does the scoring along with Bosh and Wade?
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::I would LOVE a repeat of that season! LOL
oneandonlybabe::I certainly hope the Knicks beat the Hornets but I don't know what to believe any more. Call me crazy but I've been dreading the return of Amar'e all season and my fears seem to be coming true.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::yeah amare doesnt bring much to the table the Knicks run through Felton.
nba is the worst::Yep, Kidd is basically a shooting guard at this point, and Prigioni's still coming up to NBA speed.  I'm surprised the Knicks haven't called up a PG from their D-League team
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::@Oneandonlybabe: precisely
oneandonlybabe::But that's it. Melo isn't the same in the presence of Amar'e. I am no Melo fan but the two can't coexist, imo and between the two I'd keep Melo
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::yes amare definitely doesnt hurt them but the point remains Felton is the floor general. He creates spacing for them. Without him they are lacking. Just like us without our MVP.
nba is the worst::he's played decently for just starting out, certainly hasn't hurt the knicks like 'melo's suspension and 6-26 vs the celtics has
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::physical condition and all...LOL
nba is the worst::Hornets haven't translated their recent success vs good teams to the road yet - and it's been more about Felton and Sheed's injuries than amare's return.
nba is the worst::If the Knicks are smart and play him with the 2nd unit he will dominate vs other teams' reserves
oneandonlybabe::Yes, I can't blame Amar'e for the losses. I just can't shake the feeling they need to get rid of the man before everything goes terribly wrong again. Easier said than done though.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Lol worst nice remark on the latest twitter feed update..lol
brandonlee561heat22::It's 75 here
jfreeland88::wish it would stay 75, its too hot down here
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Nice!
nba is the worst::It was freakin' 8  degrees this morning in my driveway - sucks!
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::gahhhh i know the feeling. 26 today after leaving home for the gym
brandonlee561heat22::Lakers look poised to pull the upset tonight
nba is the worst::Cavs with 9 total wins, 5 on the road, Lakers 10-9 at home, yet still anybody's game at this point (no Howard, Hill, Blake, etc)
brandonlee561heat22::lol, seems like they are due, 6 L's in a row...
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::LOL would definitely be an upset for them huh
oneandonlybabe::great minds and all that
nba is the worst::I wouldn't count on it
oneandonlybabe::Can the Lakers stop the skid with a win against the cavs, at home?
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::who cares man, the biggest joke of a preseason title favorite in NBA history thus far lol
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::LOL...the most entertaining soap opera on hardwood to date! LOL
oneandonlybabe::Oh I do for many reasons. I probably have watched the Lakers more than any other team -including mine.
oneandonlybabe::In the words of Paul Harvey "In times like these it is good to remember that there have always been times like these." Life (and sports) is just a series of deja vu moments LOL
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Morning folks!
nba is the worst::Only team in the league with a winning record that's .500 at home.  Your fanbase was acting like the refs were the difference in a blowout, despite the same # of fouls on each team, and only 4 ftas different
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Lol Knicks deserved every second of that bashing as much as we did for the loss against Phoenix the way they were talking pre-game. I do not regret anything said about the Knicks nor do I feel any need for any fans to apologize to the Knicks fans its a part of the game ;). But YES I agree just need to be healthy.
nba is the worst::The same ones that were bashing the Knicks all day on the boards.  No question Knicks want the heat in the playoffs and not the Bulls - I'm hoping both teams manage to be reasonably healthy by playoff time ;)
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::Well Im not sure which fans you are referring to but most Bulls fans post game just accepted the loss as a slacking beatdown by Phx. Lol. We just need to start winning more at home to be taken seriously as a contender.
nba is the worst::Nice win by the Bulls last night  - oh wait...
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::@oneandonlybabe:   FACT
oneandonlybabe::nba is the worst - Bulls just 7-12 vs .500 and above teams, and 3 of those are the Knicks!  And that may be just good enough for now. Again stats do not speak to the broader picture. If the bulls get Rose back healthy enough they have a good chance to challenge the Heat.
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::and 10 of those 12 losses are at home, go figure? LOL
nba is the worst::Bulls just 7-12 vs .500 and above teams, and 3 of those are the Knicks!
cuco veneno::gay
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::LOL yeah it was a good game though. How are you on this fine morning Worst?
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::oneandonlybabe - not a cause for concern. bulls have been doing this all season so not surprising esp on a b2b  Exactly ;)
nba is the worst::Ha ha, it's tough when the tuck rule doesn't apply...
oneandonlybabe::not a cause for concern. bulls have been doing this all season so not surprising esp on a b2b
ChicagoBullsChampionshipRing::LOL, nice win by the "lock pick" Broncos last night - oh wait...lmao
LebronOwnsTheNba::Heat 2 titles in 6 years!  YES BABY!
Heat_Master_Sage::oooh  that too
Heat_Master_Sage::tech it's two and 3-4 months.. close enough
LebronOwnsTheNba::<b>FAIL! WRONG AGAIN TROLL!</b>
nba is the worst::2 titles* in 7 seasons, <b>FACT</b>
LebronOwnsTheNba::referring to their first title in their 18th season of existence then their second in their 24th year. 18 + 6 is 24  Some obsessed spamming trolls cant count!
nba is the worst::But in how many seasons?  LMAO!
LebronOwnsTheNba::East 1 seed MIAMI  West 3 seed SA  1 &gt; 3
LebronOwnsTheNba::WRONG as usuall  How those Knick + Spurs predictions workin out for ya?  LMAO!
LebronOwnsTheNba::yawn  18th season and 24th season  18 + SIX = 24  run along now spamming troll
Heat_Master_Sage::it was like last year one. west had more good teams but east had the best team
nba is the worst::Debatable
My My Hey Hey::Rock Chalk!!!
LebronOwnsTheNba::Someone that posts the 2 Knick Heat scores 100 times Someone who posts an asterisk * 100 times Someone that posts ref help 100 times = SPAMMER!
LebronOwnsTheNba::YET the Heat are still in first place in the East!   Poor Trolls + Spammers!
Heat_Master_Sage::magic beat the clippers so the west isn't that great right now
oneandonlybabe::It is true that the West has a bit more parity and the East more subpar teams but that doesn't necessarily equate to the good teams in the West being  better than the top teams in the East.  No matter how many stats worst throws out there.
LebronOwnsTheNba::shouldn't talk about yourself like that even though you totally are, and obsessed with the Heat!
nba is the worst::you are clueless
LebronOwnsTheNba::yawn.....defending champs
nba is the worst::Ha ha, no rebounds, no rings!
LebronOwnsTheNba::Heat are Repeating! Who cares what the spamming Troll Says!
nba is the worst::6 ftas for the Clippers at home, lowest of the season, - to 19 ftas for the Magic despite 12 more points in the paint, 4 more FGs, and 3 less 3-pt FGAs (almost heatlike)!
nba is the worst::Best illustration of how pathetic the east is (as usual) is the fact that ONLY the heat have a winning record vs 500 and .500+ teams:  http://espn.go.com/nba/standings/_/type/expanded
Treydey10::Okc has the best record in the west, but of their 8 losses 5 have come against the east. You never tell the entire story lol.
nba is the worst::Road games are generally harder, no question - and it's impossible to "tell the whole story".
oneandonlybabe::But that matters little when certain key matchups happen and East teams beat West teams. As usual your stats can prove your points but do not tell the whole truth.
nba is the worst::7 teams from the west are at .500 or better vs .500 and .500+ opponents, only two east teams.  Facts are facts, it's up to people to tell the truth, or lie.
LebronOwnsTheNba::as usual
oneandonlybabe::Worst, didn't think you'd show your face around here after last night and your stat throwing and 'bold' predictions, LOL.  I'm still celebrating San Fran win!! Glad Kaep and Niners sent Rodgers and the Packs packing, good riddance!!
oneandonlybabe::Nope you know very well I'm talking NBA, your favorite sport by far
nba is the worst::Do tell - what NBA prediction from last night are you referring to?
LebronOwnsTheNba::Hes always wrong in his predictions. Loudmouth obsessed spammer
nba is the worst::?  Idc about NFL predictions, I'm just having fun!
LebronOwnsTheNba::Nothing is more enjoyable than watching these spamming trolls (one in particular) that continues to make predictions that are always wrong! Way to Go Heat!    Good Job Good Effort
nba is the worst::So Brandon, did you get the update on the guy that pushed the UNLV player at the Pit?
brandonlee561heat22::Nope, what happened? Was he a UNLV alum?
nba is the worst::Took them awhile to peak last season too, great coach IMO.  Nice to see Duke lose
brandonlee561heat22::Noles lost to UNC yesterday, should have won, would have been 3-0 in ACC play, oh well
brandonlee561heat22::lol, I read something about it on the comments of the video on youtube I think
nba is the worst::How did you guess?  I certainly was surprised at that plot twist - they banned him for the season (rightfully so).  After yesterday's destruction of Fresno St, Lobos are 15-2 and 2-0, if they win at Boise St it will be their 1st 3-0 start in conference ever
mkwan0::It should concern you guys how excited everyone is over a win against the Kings
Heatle Beatle::It is sad to be excited about being number 1 in the conference
Treydey10::nba is the worst - Not at all, I merely posted a fact. Big difference between a current record based largely on 5 weeks straight at home with every visiting team on a B2B and what will be at the end of the season  OMG!! Here we go with this BS about the schedule again.
nba is the worst::Not at all, I merely posted a fact.  Big difference between a current record based largely on 5 weeks straight at home with every visiting team on a B2B and what will be at the end of the season
Treydey10::nba is the worst - They are currently 5th in the league standings, "genius"  You missed his point. The Heat have played better against teams from the west.
nba is the worst::They are currently 5th in the league standings, "genius"
Heatle Beatle::Behind OKC, they have the best record against Western conference teams, "genius"
nba is the worst::Actually, 5th
mkwan0::In the east.  Wow, impressive.  They would be fourth in the west
Mambaholic 33::Seems that you and many others continue to bring them up....moving on!
nhraven52::Its a win.
mkwan0::Lol, sad
brandonlee561heat22::Chalmers went from 82nd to 59th in 3-pointers made last night
nba is the worst::Heat fans have been parroting the "live by the three, die by the three" (mostly about the Knicks) all season - 37 seems like it would fall into that category...
nba is the worst::Knicks avg 28.8 TPA/ gm, heat up to 21.8, 6.2 more than last year
Heatle Beatle::And they lived
jessica_rabbit17::Mike d'lakers season starts today!!!!lmfao!! What a complete tosser!says the season starts as they are playing the abysmal wizards!!!funny how he did not say season starts v OKC as fakers got hammers by 15 points!!! 15-21 with 3 all stars!! No wonder phil said no!!
nba is the worst::"the abysmal wizards" have beaten the #1 teams in both conferences.  Your sad/moronic need to call people "tossers" and diss the lakers is one thing, but what does that have to do with the heat-Kings game?
alicia2785::B.itch leave my mom out of these comments. GROW UP, IDIOT!!!@jessica, the witch. I saw your ignorant and dumb comment below.
alicia2785::F.uck you, jessica
jessica_rabbit17::Stop liking ur own comments u sad tosser!! Go and cry coz ur lakers are abysmal!!
Mambaholic 33::How many starts is that for this season?
Mambaholic 33::I thought the first was right after 0-8 preseason start they blew off so easily
jessica_rabbit17::Lost count!!first one was after brown got fired 5 games in!!lol
TheReturnOfNumber1::Heat win and their board doesn't reach 5,000..
nba is the worst::2 NFL playoff games have an effect
Heatle Beatle::It's damn near 10k when they lose
brandonlee561heat22::been a while since we saw a well executed game like that
nba is the worst::-10 rebs vs the 29th-place team in rebounding differential, and attempting 37 threes is "well executed"?  ;)
brandonlee561heat22::rebounding could have been better, but overall a good game
nba is the worst::No comment on the rebounding, got it
Heatle Beatle::Shooting 56% fg with 45% from 3, is pretty damn good.
_Pippen aint easy_::Yup.
TheReturnOfNumber1::They did play the Kings..
brandonlee561heat22::Thanks, I saw the game
Mambaholic 33::Fakers v Cleveland today...any prediction on how that turns out? Hope Kyrie goes easy on them.   ---ROR
seanie719::Kobe Bryant talking to his teammates right before The Lakers take the floor...  "Don't get any ideas from that Chalmers kid"
Mambaholic 33::Boy! that's going to be an informant meeting.
onlyavoice57::Forget Mario, Haslem Actually Scored 5 Points
Mambaholic 33::Season high?  Lol
nhraven52::Hey, Miami won!!Good weekend.
Mambaholic 33::Rodgers &amp; Peyton lost even better :)
Jake Sterling Silver::Norris Cole is going to have 2 rings in 2 years.
Yup I am here.::Heat only 11-7 against the East, but 13-4 against the West.  While OKC has only 3 losses against the West, but 5 against the East.  Go Figure!
bucksnreds::LeBron, unlike Kobe, is not a ball hog. Took only 10 shots and made 7 of them. Sign of a mature player. Kobe would not have let Chalmers take as many 3s....
Mambaholic 33::He would'a given him the look!
