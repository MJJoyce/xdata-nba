it is what it is::Which Pacer team shows up today?  The one that shares the ball and plays suffocating defense or the one that watches while George jacks up 11 three's and just stands around on defense?  The rebounding lately has been horrendous!
bgood2life::Coach Vogel should seriously think about switching Danny Granger to shooting guard and start Lance Stephenson, as the point guard. Bring George Hill off the bench, as the sixth man.
Hoseff::I will make a HUGE bet the following cheap cheat fans will make an appearance again on this pacers game comment board: 1) HEINZY 2) I STATE 3) COREY 4) SDA 5) HEAT IN 5  count on these guys to be monitoring pacers all the time and showing their jealousy, insecurity & FEAR you will see how RESTLESS & ANXIOUS they have become since the heat's window are already closing
Anton::Lance Stephenson is the best player for Indiana. George gets higher stats because he has more touches and plays made for him but Lance is more efficient.
Francis::Granger is working his way back into shape.  Lookout NBA.  The Pacers are going to get better.
Seattle Blows!::you pacers fans, i respect your team. you dudes have a really fkin good team. i say better than MIA by a smidge. you're defense is scary and hibbert, george and hill are pretty good...george is a beast from hell. can't wait till you come to the bay area and play my Dubs. should be a good game. -a warriors fan
Cory Jones::Danny has 6, season high is 12. Anyone think he can top it tonight??
Jack::Pacers are going to crush the Pelicans
Eric H::Can the Pacers trade G.Hill for Rondo please.  I love my Pacers but I have a real problem with G. Hill
Travis J::I love how morons say the Pacers wouldn't be very good if they played in the west, and yet they have the second best record in the entire league against the west, at 8 and 2!
