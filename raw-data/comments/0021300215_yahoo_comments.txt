Golden Groin::Start Zeller at the PF, what is there to lose other than develop your 1st round pick?
VERACITY::Did i see Coach Clifford hand motion call Ben Gordon into the huddle during a time-out mid 3rd qtr? I don't know why he's in the dog house but his body language is obvious to a dead duck on the end of the bench non-involved.
Francis::Pacers are playing great team basketball, keep up the great work.
fcbonilla::Wow Lance Stephenson has really improved this year. Indiana might have George for MVP, Hibbert for Defensive Player of the Year and Lance Stephenson I see going for most improved player this year so far.
LarryR::Idiots.Pacers are THE best TEAM this year.You dont need 1-2 "Superstars" to win a championship! And you also dont have to be representing an EAST COAST- WEST COAST city.Keep tuning in to Pacers Basketball and the Boys will teach you some things this whole year.
John H::East may be weak, but at least we get to see those pretenders down in Miami sent home in the play-offs. The Heat will have no chance getting past the Pacers this year.
Trevor::All Indiana faced so far are out of playoffs #$%$ teams.
Knickschamp Tumblr Com::hillbilly pacers are ripe for a blow out loss, this season it looks like the hillbilly pacers are playing the role of the bulls winning in the regular season and losing in the playoffs.
Beans Javi::knicks fans got nothing better to do but unleash comment diarrhea on better teams
hajay21::I didn't get to watch the game.  How did Cody Zeller do?  How did he look against the big boys?
