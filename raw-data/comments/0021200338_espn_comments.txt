AGV345::wow! kyrie was unbelievable to watch!
TennisPimp007::ummmmm don't get your hopes up Knicks fans  KNICKS RECORD = INFLATED DUE TO A WEAK@.$$ schedule once they hit the difficult part of their schedule they'll go back to being a mediocre team with a 42-40 record  WRITE IT DOWN
KnixTape24::Lol easy schedule. They have played a good amount of teams that aren't good but they have killed those teams. Not to mention, they've played Miami twice beat em both times, beat the spurs, 76ers twice, Mavs 1 and 1, beat the lakers, Pacers, Nets 1 and 1.
KnixTix::Haters gonna hate.  They see what's going on here with the Knicks and know it's something special, but they don't want to admit it because their teams are experiencing serious deficiencies.  The pimpted out Tennis bum is probably a Heat fan.  You know Heat fans lead the league in excuses!
BasketballJones556677::good write up about Kyrie Irving becoming the best PG in the league on StraightHoops  .com this week
CLUTCHBALLERZ::cant wait till kyrie signs with the knicks once he hits free agency
nsmithNYC::Knick fans thought the same thing about Lebron for years. How did that work out?
Ya Boi Chris 69 69::thats stupid hes going to the Lakers, he looks up to Kobe
Jay cutler has 3 chins::"Can we get me one of them face masks and line the inside of it with BBQ sauce"  Felton
KnicksCuse718::damn you self liked this real quick
Jay cutler has 3 chins::it was a great comment
KnixTix::Good call to sit Melo...it's all about the big picture.  Plus it gives guys that don't get minutes some time on the floor to build up their confidence for when we really will need them.  No Melo, Sheed, Camby, Stat, Shump!  The depth of this team is going to serve us well when it matters!!!
swiftandabundant::No Melo, no problem.  Knickstape still rollin!  http://tinyurl.com/GoingtotheKnicksGame
KevinJohnsonThaTruth::Batman or an early 2000's R.Kelly is what I was thinking when I saw him with the mask on.
who stole my lighter...::LOL when ur point guard shoots the ball 25 f.ucking times... .u lost
ApookTheDestroyer::25 shots for 41 points? I'll take that any day from any player. And yeah, this Knicks fan would take Kryie Irving in a heartbeat even though I've been very pleased with Felton, Kidd and Prigioni.
KnixTape24::Ok number one. A Knick's fan will never ever be jealous of a Cavs fan. Your team is in Cleveland, OHIO. You lost Lebron James. Will you even get to the playoffs in the next 5 years? When's the last time you were in the playoffs? Hmm. 2009 season, thats right lets not even think about that too much hurt. One Eastern Conf. title. No championships ever. Yeah your right he's probably jealous.
11ClevelandSteamer11::Who stole my lighter is just jealous that we have a bright future with kyrie and that the knicks STILL wont make it past MIA in the playoffs
ThisSiteTakesItDeep::Said the same thing about Lebron?..
DourSiesel::actually varejao is why the cavs lost. if he hit his last FT it would've went to OT
Mr. C1ean::Sour Diesel is my favorite, followed by Blue Dream.
smtate91::Seems to work rather well for OKC and Chicago when Rose is healthy. If a guy is scoring he keeps shooting, doesn't matter what position.
clevesports::if someone is shooting 60% from the field, i don't care what position he is playing i want him to shoot.  especially when he is draining 3's (made 5 of them) and is a great ft shooter
ApookTheDestroyer::41 points on 25 shots? I'll take that any day from any player.
nba is the worst::Ridiculous to claim kyrie was why the Cavs lost.
who stole my lighter...::lol well good for u... u must lose a lot of ball games like kyrie
Jets_Nets_Mets_Equal_Regrets::Kyrie scores 40+ and team loses -"Amazing" Melo scores 40+ and team loses-"Ball Hog"  -Truth
11ClevelandSteamer11::look at shooting percentages
BlazersWar::well, the talent around these guys is nowhere near comparable.
vandeman34::*False
Atl_Yank::Great night for the Knicks! A win without their star, and losses by the Nets and Celtics!
nba is the worst::Nice to see Woodson give Copeland some tick for once. Lots of talent there - he should get 20 min/game vs all below .500 teams
who stole my lighter...::LOL u should coach
SEC University is my favorite team::Cleveland will be sad when he takes off for greener pastures
SEC University is my favorite team::The masked man gettin nasty in madison square garden
BronyFan::Impressive night, hope the Cavaliers learn to build around their player unlike the last guy.
nba is the worst::Way to survive Kidd's first bad game.  Felt bad for Varejao - but 10-0 baby!!!
captnb2thep::I think people should vote for Kyrie for the All-Star game, last I heard he was 4th in voting for Eastern conference guards, and even though I don't think he is the best, and in most cases, not better than Rondo, D-Will, and D-wade, at this point he is EASILY one of the most fun guards to watch. VOTE HIM IN!
11ClevelandSteamer11::Def think hes a top 3 guard in the league right now.  I would put Rondo and CP3 ahead
DanNYC2108::he is playing better than d will
Cool7boy2004::i think with similar talent he might just be better than all of them and im a knicks fan
caferay::Uncle Drew plays Phantom of the Opera.
TarheelClone::You can see Irving getting better,just how good is he going to be.I think he will someday be in the same sentences with some of the all time greats.
Atl_Yank::Granted, I've only really watched him vs the Knicks, but Irving is a beast.  Hey Cavs, maybe try to hold on to this one.
Rodney Stanger::He gets buckets
eflemingjr::He'll be a Knick in 2015.....
11ClevelandSteamer11::hahah the Knicks will be old and on the decline by then
DourSiesel::this is what i think will happen too, and as far as the cavs matching the knicks will probably trade for him at that point.
clevesports::he will be a restricted free agent even if he wanted to go cavs can match...
Cool7boy2004::hes a jersey kid you might just be right about that one
tgorulez::Hope Melo learns something fron this kid... You don't have to 100% to be in the game. Hey Melo man up !!
KnixTape24::Tell you what. Clearly you like bein a 100% Melo hater. Stupid comments like these should be left to the Cavs boards alone. Stop commenting here.
caferay::Melo's earned a blow from time to time, particularly if his knee is ringing. Good game for Irving, the Cavs and particularly the Knicks.
Cool7boy2004::well all be happy in the playoffs when he fresher than everyone around him
Atl_Yank::Perhaps you haven't been watching this year, Melo's been all man.
tgorulez::when he's playing... I wanna see more "Kobe like gamer qualities" I guess we forgot about the cut finger on non shooting hand.
Mets-Jets-Knicks19::wow...dumb comment
RRC3179::Very stupid
KnickDiaz::stupid comment!.....dude has a sore knee hip n ankle...59 games left why risk it on 1 game?
ApookTheDestroyer::ewing didn't play in the finals against san antonio . . . because he was injured. You don't play an injured player early in the rgular season simply because some posting board moron things everybody needs to 'man up'.
tgorulez::I guess you don't watch the great ones play. Ewing played the last 2 yrs on f.u.cked up knees. Kobe sprains an ankle and misses 5 min comes right back. Kobe breaks a finger on his shooting hand, ties it up and plays
OmniVersal::Difference between a leg injury and a jaw injury. You need your legs more for basketball than your jaw unless you're Kobe
SECisreelfutball::Fire Byron Scott. That is all.
thomez::Super dumb comment.
RRC3179::Dumb comment.
HeatWillRepeat::Knicks will NEVER beat the Heat in a 7 game series! NEVER!
11ClevelandSteamer11::As a cavs fan i agree.  Enjoy the regular season wins knicks fans cus your not getting past MIA
KnixTix::Heat fans seem to forget that the Knicks always broke their hearts in the 90s.  Granted we had some tough years since then, but the tide is turning back to it's rightful place.
RRC3179::I love blind Heat fans. They act like they've been on top for years. They were fortunate to win last year.
nba is the worst::They were on top in 2011?  Uhh, no
Melos Leg::"They've been on top for years", technically two years is years....soooo
KnickDiaz::keep telling your self that..... tap your heels when u say it!!
theflyeststar::cleveland got lucky to get kyrie, that kid is going to be an all time great
11ClevelandSteamer11::yup cus every player in the league is a front runner....
SECisreelfutball::He will be gone in 3 years to NY/LA/Miami
nahoapdad::There needs to be some sort of sports / IQ quiz required before logging onto message boards. People on here are amazingly uninformed / unintelligent.
RRC3179::Idiots come out in droves on the internet
SRQLivesForever::does it seem that the knicks defense is worse now than it was at the beginning of the season?   i mean how do you give up 41 points to a scrub like kyle irving?  i never even heard of the guy until today
GetInMyBelly43::i think he was joking?
RRC3179::SRQ listens to the games by transistor radio. Big big NBA fan he is.
NorthEast9er::Srq- you don't watch much basketball do you?
vandeman34::Kyrie will be better than Paul, thats for sure
SRQLivesForever::yo rrc i was kind of a d.ick before for no reason  are we cool now bro
RRC3179::Its all good bro go get yourself NBA league pass and educate yourself
SRQLivesForever::oh for real he did that?  no way. sorry bro i actually didn't know that
RRC3179::Yea ask everybody in the team USA tryouts whom he torched all training camp. All top 30 NBA players but I'M dumb?
SRQLivesForever::$@%! off, d.ouchebag  kyle irving is a scrub and you're a dumb@ss
KnickDiaz::Wow dude d u even have cable???..... he was the #1 pick   he was the rookie of the year he is a top 5-7 PG in the entire league.......you are dumb and know nothing of basketball so shut it!
SRQLivesForever::if he's such a big deal then why don't people talk about him as much as kobe, lebron, melo, durant, cp3, etc.
DourSiesel::its his 2nd year in the league troll and he won ROTY last year
RRC3179::SRQ u stupid.
jetfan1680::if u never heard of kyle Irving u don't know much about  the NBA
nonaligned::I haven't seen him play in weeks.....musta been riding the bench.
RRC3179::He was out with a broken finger and he broke his Jaw last game and still finished it out, wow some of u guys are dumb
Khaos0924::Knick fans would you rather lose in the ECF or the Finals?  It's pretty obvious you will at least make that far this year barring major injuries.
celticsfan748::lold
RRC3179::Want that ring! NOW!!
strkeout::Half of Cleveland's team looked like they were mimicking Phantom of the Opera.
SRQLivesForever::lmfaoooooooooooo
PurpleOrioles::Probably confused the people who were used to going to the theater district
RRC3179::Cavs should trade Andy Verejao and CJ Miles to the Knicks for Amar'e.
phlyglesfan::"In this fall, imma take my talents to South Beach." - Kyrie in 3 years
bwp2bruce::Uncle Drew needs a mask?
PurpleOrioles::Remember when people said it was a mistake to take Irving over Derrick Williams? Doesn't seem like a mistake right now
nonaligned::would've had 51 without the busted jaw...
nugsavsroxbroncs::im dwade grater den jordan
wuchs11::would've been a great matchup to see
Marek7476::I feel pity for Irving, he is in the exact same situation as Lebron.
manoamano36::everybody forgot lebron took the cavs to the ECF twice?  melo didnt do that
M Carmichael::got em there and checked out.
eflemingjr::And Melo did get to the WCF....a much tougher conference BTW.
RRC3179::Eastern Conference was the JV for 12 years. So I don't see your point.
inityminiwur::The way the Knicks have been playing and with the depth that they have, I can't imagine a team that can beat them in a seven-game series. The Kidd-Felton combination has been fantastic. Is it too early to say "New York Knicks: 2012-13 NBA Champions"?
wuchs11::Yes. Not until 20??
YaImFromCleveland::I remember back then when so many people said he's gonna be a bust cause he only played 5 games with duke...
krappie1010::I know it's late, but does anyone know where I can find a good sports betting system?
David Lee Should Be An All Star::WARRIORS!!
DourSiesel::David Lee was a knick. he was good for us too,but he's better now.
RRC3179::David Lee should be a Knick. MARK JACKSON!!!!
alicia2785::Knicks are winning because all the other teams that they have beat just sleepwalked through the games.
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::The Knicks are winning because they're hungrier to start the season.  But that's not the optimal time to be hungry.  I followed the Cavs when they used to be hungry in the regular season...  60+ wins... #1 seed.... HOORAY!!!!  Once you enter the playoffs everything resets.  (Bulls fans can back me up on this)
RRC3179::Liked your comment. Hate your user name LOL Not even CLOSE but he has more story to right. You're right about it not being the optimal time but who says you can't keep it up during the playoffs. The Knicks have the best roster in the NBA and if it's all together and healthy come playoff time. Miami we have a problem.
shaboogiebk::That kid Irving is a PROBLEM!!!
Hey Ma... Im Done With My Segment::The only great problem on that team
09jtaylo::Anyone else think Kyrie is auditioning for a chance to be honored to have MSG as his home arena?
11ClevelandSteamer11::Says a Knick fan every time a player torches them in their home arena....See LeBron James free agency two years ago
OTownBuckeye::You're out of your mind. But ok.
RRC3179::Yea we will see when his rookie contract is up.
Hey Ma... Im Done With My Segment::Noep
alicia2785::Melo=ballhogger. Damn the Knicks!!!
RRC3179::sheesh. Can you Melo haters please watch a game.
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::You have to watch out for these young stars who have career games in MSG.  Those are the special ones.  They do it in Mecca for a reason.
Kev0100::Ive been using this bet system called Sportsbettingstar. I doubled my starting balance and made almost $3,000 within two months. You can find this system on the first page of google by searching for sports betting systems.
Kobe_uses_1_ply_toilet_paper::been using a flag system called Spamflaggingstar. I doubled my initial flagging the first month and flagged almost 3,000 spammers by the end of my second just following this systems tips. You can flag the spammers on google by searching for spam flagging systems.
Mcfly_2015::that mask is really scary. no wonder he dropped a career high
HoraceGrants::SOOO GLAD LIN IS LONG GONE
OTownBuckeye::and you were watching :O
O Zone Pro.::While you were rubbing yourself.
carmenohio93::10 months ago u was slobbering on his yang thing..
BillSimmonsRuinedNBACountdown::and u were ridin it
