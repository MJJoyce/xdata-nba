Professor::As a former coach now analyst of the NBA, I don't see why the coaches continue to give McLemore so many minutes of playing time.  30 minutes.  No assists, no rebounds 2 turnovers and 5 points.  And the trend continues on defense. McLemore, Thomas and Thornton got schooled again.
John::As an analyst, I have to say Thomas, McLemore and Thornton played horribly on defense.  Ginobili and Parker could have decided to be selfish and could have 50 points each. This has been a constant problem for SAC defense.
david::I like IT sort of, plenty of small guys can score, but look at his defense? It is pretty much non existent against a good guard who can use the screen properly, he is just too small.
SwiftyLazer::Big Cuz with the double/double already! ///
dot::Jimmer Fredette get's a little bit of playing time and only scores 4 points.... pathetic!
Vlad::im kind of impressed by the kings beating miami a few days ago and now playing sas tough. maybe theyve turned a corner and found something
CYRUS C::please place Belinelli back on the bench. He's been awful since starting. Let Green start again!
Guest::Kings just tore the King a new one so their chests will be all puffed up tonight. GSG.
SwiftyLazer::Lets go Sac Town! #CaliKings ///
Zombies Rule.::Kings suck
