Justin::Hayward plays very aggressively on both ends of the floor and takes it to the hole with authority on the fast break.. he's had some vicious dunks and blocks this year.. and he's taken some really hard falls.. I think he could be one of those players that could end up being on the injured list a lot during his career.. not because he's injury prone but just because he plays so hard
Cyril::I think Brian Shaw's process for determining his rotation each night involves a blindfold and a dartboard.
Amir::Denver was the best team to watch last season, now they are typical hot/cold expect everything team.    Missing Karl coaching so much.
Rebecca::The Jazz have the potential to run the Nuggets off the court, however the experience is not quite there yet. The Jazz by 15 points tonight and I perdict TB will have 20 points along with 12 assists.
PKM::Could Trey win rookie of the year?
georgem::GO JAZZ GO
PKM::Did Burks start?
MichaelM::30pts 19reb from the Jazz big men

GC::how many blonde girls Enes Kanter can #$%$?
