Maxi Klinger::Great defense bobcats lol
8723Chris::Been following this bet system called sportsbettingstar the past couple months. Ive made between 2-3K a month profits using the systems picks. You can find this system on the first page of google by searching for sports betting systems. If you bet you gotta check this out.
sduke1986::Went to the game tonight and sad my cats lost, but glad i saw such a great game.  Another 2 inches and G would have hit that 40 footer at the end.  Glad my dukies played great tonight.  I also won two tickets to the pacers game on the scratch off.  Missed half of the 3rd quarter waiting in line to redeem them though.  Gg cavs. Go bobcats!
big18brad::U cavs need to trade vareajao for sure
TheBrownestBob::Trading Varejao can't come fast enough.  Perhaps it would put more pressure on Thompson, but with the way he's been performing lately and his upside compared to Varejao's, it's clear Thompson thrives when Varejao's not on the floor with him.  I always questioned his defensive rebounding but Tristan has been pulling down more and more defensive rebounds/ game since Varejao's been sidelined.  It's also nice to see Dion accept the benching and do whatever he could to help the team win.
tallonrk1::Oh good god, can someone PLEASE get Kyrie some help out there? Its embarrassing...Might as well rename the team to Kyrie &amp; Company...
gocavs172::say what you will about kyries defense, but limiting kemba to 11 points and sessions to 4-11 shooting sounds pretty good to me. Plus the 4 steals and 3 swats, so idk even if the bobcats suck, there PG position is strong enough for this to be viewed as progress for kyrie in my eyes.
AGirlThatLovesSports_::kyrie definitely didn't hold kemba to 11 points, hell noo; nooo way ^____^
UConnTaliek::Kemba was also sat midway through the 3rd quarter and never got back in the game.  Still no explanation for the move, but Kemba would have probably had 20 or more had he played the rest of the game.
TCluvcarpanthers::He didn't really hold Kemba. In 24 minutes, he scored 11 points on 4-8 shooting. That's pretty good. And Sessions is Sessions.
gklein1908::espns nba reporting 1. kobe calls clippers contender 2. heat are "unmotivated" 3. tim tebow 4. rex ryans tatoo nowhere. kyries game winner
scanmanOSU::I turn on sportscenter looking to see where the game winner ranked on Friday's Top 10 plays... Apparently it doesn't
Kujosh54321::Wow Kyrie was amazing tonight! Kinda disappointed that Kemba didn't play in the 4th quarter but I see why the coach made that decision. gg cavs, and good luck.  Hail to the small market teams!
oherthneck::why does ESPN hide all cle/cavs stuff on their site??? they crowned kyrie as 'next' on the cover of their mag, kyrie goes out and dominates and hits game winner with one second left, yet somehow 'kobe calls clippers legit title contender' gets on the feed and this doesnt... these jokers need to get it together and show kyrie and the cavs some love
Kujosh54321::You are worried about what  ESPN has to say? We're talking about the same network that promotes the "real" show, first take, and goes to Steven A. Smith for "insightful" basketball reporting.
AustinBeal::As a Spurs fan, I would like to welcome you to our world.
TRHMC1::MVP performance.
ClevelandFanatic4Ever::Kyrie was 2 Blocks and 1 Steal away from a 5x5 game, that's pretty good.
doggbrown1::kyrie is having another blow out season!! 8 wins and counting
yata-9arasu::Patience...
yata-9arasu::Wow...  I can't believe I missed this one...  WHAT A GAME BY KYRIE and nice job by TT!  He is really developing!  Patience everyone.....  The people calling Thompson a bust are going to look really dumb....   Good game Bobcats!!!  GO CAVS!!!
Phatepiclewts::Annnnd Bobcats lose again :-/
TCluvcarpanthers::If you expected wins this season, you're crazy.
DrawohWasHere::5, 4, 3, 2...
DrawohWasHere::While Kyrie has become Mr. Clutch and had another good game, I think people are missing the fact Tristan Thompson is growing very quickly into that PF the Cavs wanted when they drafted him #4 last season.    Another double double for doubleT!    AND... if it weren't for that rebound in traffic in under one minute while knocking down both FTs, Kyrie doesn't get a chance to make that buzzer beater.
JohnsonnnL::Yeah Thompson is playing very well under the radar right now.
quickbr0wnf0x::I guess when the Cavs had an 18 point lead, they were afraid fans were going to tune the game out, so they decided to make the game more interesting by giving up the lead for a few seconds.  Gordon and Sessions were on FIRE for a while, but had too many heat checks, and the Cavs weathered the storm and came away with the win on Kyrie's clutch shot.   Despite all my cliches, the game was definitely not one.
StompYourFace25::See you all later, going to the movies with my friends (something that EricTheYanks doesn't have) to see Django. Is it any good?
DrawohWasHere::btw, People like their own post if they see someone else like their post cause they don't want anyone else to think it was just you that liked the link.   What's wrong with that?
curtiscarter11::sorry no $@%! aint having convo with one either see ya queer
seniorgong::@stompYourFace25 LOL dude they just hating because you actually make sense in your comments. I'll put them on blast anytime on my twitter account @50cent. have fun bro
StompYourFace25::Alright, movie is at 10:45 anyway so I'll be on my way.   I understand why you are always so grumpy, you "share popcorn" with your boyfriend EricTheYanks.
seniorgong::d bag lay off the cocaine meh...you sound kinda suspect m u tha f u k k a
curtiscarter11::i bet you guys share a popcorn and soda too huh
StompYourFace25::No, I save my money and don't buy that stuff. What, sharing a popcorn would be "gay" to you?
curtiscarter11::boyfriends
StompYourFace25::Yes, my friends are guys and girls. is there a problem with that?
seniorgong::Great movie...controversial as f**k but great. worth the price of admission. peace out
StompYourFace25::Thanks dude see ya later
curtiscarter11::wow you are queer
StompYourFace25::I'm a queer cause I have friends.... while you are sitting in front of your computer calling people over the internet queers
seniorgong::I'm out EricTheYank is farting from the mouth way too many times. Good game Cats
seniorgong::Whoever said Greg Ehlo was clutch is missing the point. Any clutchness Ehlo had went out the damn window when MJ hit that game winner over him and karate kicked him after. just sayin'
quickbr0wnf0x::Greg Ehlo wasn't too good.   However, Craig Ehlo did have a lot of clutch performances with the Cavs, the MJ shot notwithstanding.
seniorgong::Good insight and true but so many people don't even know that...all they remember is "the shot on Ehlo good it's gooood" lol and it's one of the most replayed NBA &amp; mj moment kinda sucks to be Ehlo
EricTheYank::You know it is "Craig", right?
seniorgong::thank you fn name doctor
StompYourFace25::kid it took you 7 minutes to fake THAT picture? What did you take your faked screenshot with? A potato? LOL get a life.
EricTheYank::You are a sad, sad person.
StompYourFace25::I'm the sad person? You're the one who is flipping $@%! over me "liking" my own comments
seniorgong::who gives a f**k dude. this sh*t is idiotic at best. go play with your little photoshop sh*t and get the F**k off this board...you little gurrrrrrrl
15knick15::Bobcats are 8 and 24 in games decided by points
RZA_CONSOLE::MJ's got a good team brewing  they need a real center
DwightSchrute24::Cavs have never had a more clutch player than Kyrie
quinnELTONeverts::FACT: Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Gallactica.
jbrad12500::Cleveland = Armpit of America
ricky2213::how original
goosu123::^Stupid. At least come up with something original.
orange_63::lebron james
quickbr0wnf0x::Obviously, Dwight.
DwightSchrute24::Is that a joke?
RZA_CONSOLE::craig ehlo?
jbrad12500::Mark Price
RZA_CONSOLE::LEBRON
curtiscarter11::if anyone who are real cavs fans dont give a damn bout that $@%! no more we got kyrie who just nailed a dagger you lose

goosu123::What the hell does that link to?
seniorgong::Who give s a flying f**k about likes. I'm liked by most people in the real world and if you're liking my comment you're probably passing gas anyways
DrawohWasHere::You got something against gas?
goosu123::StompYourFace25I'm not trusting your link until someone else goes on it.    Why did it take your exactly 7 minutes to post? Why were you faking something that isn't important at all? People like you are why europeans want genocide on US  I'm pretty sure that is you my friend. The link has a post of your own that you liked.
goosu123::"in the actually font"  1. You should get spell check, it will help you with grammar 2. I've heard people talk about this add on before, and that is the font the site uses when telling about the number of likes a post has received
StompYourFace25::Fake as hell, I showed MY screenshots, which weren't blurry as hell and in the actually font this website uses
StompYourFace25::I dunno apparently I'm "gay" and a "$@%!$@" for something I didn't do.
seniorgong::@erictheYank nah dude...what's sad is that your obsession with who "like" what is pathetic
StompYourFace25::I'm not trusting your link until someone else goes on it.  Why did it take your exactly 7 minutes to post? Why were you faking something that isn't important at all? People like you are why europeans want genocide on US
StompYourFace25::Yup, I definitely make out with boys because I allegedly "liked" my own comment. That kid probably has a 2 inch wiener and the closest girl he got to was his mom
EricTheYank::What is sad is that you deny what you did. http://s8.postimage.org/uenukudxh/File.jpg
seniorgong::tell the b a s t a r d s to go get a life...their comebacks are lame as f **k anyway
EricTheYank::http://s8.postimage.org/uenukudxh/File.jpg
goosu123::"why did it take you 5 minutes to post? faking an image i see?"  He probably had to scroll down to it.
StompYourFace25::not trusting your links until someone else goes to it. And if this is a real link, why did it take you 5 minutes to post? faking an image i see?
goosu123::It is a real link of you liking your own post.
Theclekid89::Seen some bobcat fan try to justify this loss by saying the Cavs have a worse record.... Wow. The Cavs have a whole two more loses with the same amount of wins. With the bobcats coming off that 17 game slide, odds are they woulda made up that differential easily. Doesn't the entire arguement work against your justification anyways? It would mean you just lost to a "worse" team...
EricTheYank::The bottom line is both teams are at the bottom of the NBA without much chance of improving. Anyone who engages in trash talking or takes it personal is just sad.
goosu123::Not much chance of improving? Maybe this season, but the Cavs have Irving, TT, Andy(trade value), Waiters + a top pick + a $@%! load of other picks stocked up + a bunch of money for FA(Bynum said he may come to cleveland). Grant is a fantastic GM, I'm confident he'll bring the Cavs back as a contender in the east, and we all know Gilbert is willing to spend cash.
ctown8686::Not to mention we been missing the Wild Thang for awhile
StompYourFace25::"It would mean you just lost to a "worse" team... "  Heat lost to the Wiz. so what?
quickbr0wnf0x::Hmm, Washington took Brooklyn to double OT.   All these players are professionals with some skills, otherwise they wouldn't have made it to this level.  So, anything can happen, but not always very often!    If you understand what I just said, please explain it to me - thanks!
Theclekid89::... Check this out.. You said the Cavs are worse then the cats bc of two more losses. The heat have more wins then the wiz. That null and voids your wiz being Better then the heat via records.
StompYourFace25::Okay tell me how?
Theclekid89::You again, just flawed your argument...
StompYourFace25::EricTheYank There's your proof. You can get an add on for firefox to show you who likes a post, loser. ___  Yes, it is not hard to copy and paste a post and change "1 fans like this." to "StompYourFace25 likes this."  Show me a screenshot of your "firefox addon".

Kenny0123456::StompYourFace25 - Alright, take me a screen shot of your screen  Lol why are you denying it? Its dumb! Its like you taking the last cookie and then when cofronted with the crumbs around you mouth you just deny it.
StompYourFace25::Alright, take me a screen shot of your screen
StompYourFace25::fk one got cut off.  but yeah, where do you see that?

seniorgong::It's crazy how in Sports nowadays the business side of things is so damn obvious. Kemba sitting the entire fourth Quarter...Coaches getting fired etc.  It's one giant Soap Opera being played out everyday, they should just sign a contract with the Soap channel already...geeez
AvengedByCats::It's worse in the EPL.
Kenny0123456::Lol hows Dunlap coaching looking to you all? He is the NBA version of Pat Shurmur
quinnELTONeverts::Hahaha thats true
quinnELTONeverts::Oregon State is my favorite college team......... I AM THE MOST MISERABLE SPORTS FAN IN THE UNIVERSE.
Kenny0123456::Well some more good news, Chip Kelly won't be up there to bully you all anymore.
chighfield18::their talent is better than 20 point losses and huge blown leads...im tired hearing this talent excuse..their free agent signings along with Kemba and Gilchrist are money
quinnELTONeverts::Please dont look at my favorite teams......
Kenny0123456::Ouch! Well the good news is Chip Kelly might be the next Browns coach by Saturday afternoon, we have the 3rd or 4th best salary cap space in the league, and Trent will be healthy next year to play in the Chip Kelly offense.

quinnELTONeverts::I hate to say it, but not having Kemba in might be Dunlap seeing how they can do without him, and if the Cats want Demarcus Cousins...................................................................
chighfield18::Won't ever happen..Kemba's got the key to the car...for better or worse.
AvengedByCats::I don't want Cousins. Guys a walking technical foul.
quinnELTONeverts::I agree, I think we should be patient with the young team and not do anything crazy
cheis65::AvengedByCats I-77 is a nightmare.  independence Football team i hate them and mallard creek.
AvengedByCats::Ohhhh you're talking bout high schools. My high school didn't even have a football team.
AvengedByCats::Headline for this game: "Irving's jumper at the end sinks the hapless/woeful/sorry/etc. Bobcats."
seniorgong::lol funny headline but "hapless" that's a little too harsh
goosu123::A better win percentage just means a worse pick. Not really relevant at this point.
AvengedByCats::We're hardly the fans to talk about win percentage...
StompYourFace25::yup even though we have a better win percentage than the cavs.
AvengedByCats::Those are all adjectives ESPN likes to use when describing the Bobcats.
AvengedByCats::ESPN just makes me mad, harrumph.
StompYourFace25::Now I know why Cavs fans are talking $@%! when they have a worse record than us.......  They are still crying LeBron left  "curtiscarter11 kyrie in your face sucka you guys are bums always will be"  Idiot of the year my friends
straub42::Haha you are pathetic. Nobody is crying about LeBron anymore. You are just jealous because we actually have a future.  And at least we had somebody at some point that could leave. What do you guys say, "Wah! Emeka Okafor is still gone!"  You all are terrible.  Go Cavs!
Theclekid89::Worse record? Are you an idiot? Don't bother answering, it's rhetorical. You've played two more games, and with y'all coming off a 17 game losing streak, odds are that if you had played those two games in differential, you woulda lost them. Put down the pipe, and go to bed.
cheis65::AvengedByCats  I hate Charlotte why is beacuse i hate  independence.
AvengedByCats::I-77 is a nightmare.
StompYourFace25::24 min for Kemba? What are you doing Dunlap?
seniorgong::The BIG  story from this tonight won't be "Uncle Drew clutch" or "Gordon was on fire" it will be ...."WTF is going on in Dunlap's brain"
cheis65::AvengedByCats Hometown, baby. Love the city of Charlotte.  I live in monroe but i conisder the bobcats represent all of carolina .
AvengedByCats::I live in Wesley Chapel but I love Charlotte regardless.
