Drinking with Bernie or Sandusky which is more entertaining::LMAO Bulls are so overrated! LeBron FINISHES unlike Rose!!
jworleyTGOE::No one finishes better than Sandusky
sokal-surf::LeBron "finishes" at what -- second place?!?!?
iwillwinalways2003::Hey buddy Lebron didn't finish yesterday and almost cost his team the game. Think before you speak
TotallyFknRad::Wait I thought the whole Lebron guarding D. Rose concept wouldn't work? sure looked like it did yesterday
_TheSixthHeatle_::Rose was 3-6 with assists....lebron didn't bother him
nba is the worst::+12 fts works almost every time
brandonlee561heat::I did, didnt work. who knows.
nba is the worst::haven't heard of this one - didn't you say you don't have author blocker etc at work?
brandonlee561heat::Work. lol I have to log out everytime i want to read the comments
nba is the worst::try rebooting(?)
brandonlee561heat::I cant see the conversation when im logged in. If im logged out, i can read it, lame. What the heck!?
nba is the worst::Weird - are you at work or home?
nba is the worst::DaCoach20121  If Larry Bird were alive today, he would have the Heat as the Best team too. I love the Heat so much, but I know the 4 time NBA champ Larry Bird would also agree. Its just comon sense. Go Heat!!!!"
inglehacker::Crunch-time scoring ranking for Lebron in the last 4 years:  1st, 2nd, 1st, and 4th Crunch-time scoring ranking for Rose is last 4 years: n/a, 36th, 15th, and 2nd Crunch-time FG% for Lebron in the last 4 years: 48%, 56%, 49%, and 44% Crunch-time FG% for Rose in the last 4 years: n/a, 44%, 45%, and 40%  So who has proven themselves in the clutch over time?
jworleyTGOE::where are you getting these stats?
Oxfordian Theory::You can't compare Rose to LeBron... Rose hasn't done anything significant in crunch time in his career yet.  LeBron has countless big games where he's pulled his teams through in the clutch in glorious fashion.
D-Nice891::this is obvious, people just hate on Lebron and the only thing left for them to say is he doesn't have a ring and he can't do it when it counts. That will change after this year tho.
nba is the worst::Or not
big red 25::Love how everyone brings up Deng guarding Lebron.  See last year's ECF, kind of a silly argument eh????  I also wonder why Wade plays like crap against chicago.  I wonder if Wade will ride the bench this year if they meet in the ECF again, conserving his energy and come out in the finals like he's revived and get all the glory.
MegaDrewton6000::bron bron
Aceblazin247::Howard to the Bulls. Let's GO!
dan torell::Good luck Bulls... Howard is a diva and this will be an end to the Bulls's leading wins... enter hack a howard!
DitkasSweaterVest::Unfortunately, I don't think we've seen the last of this headline...  "Bulls rally back, but can't beat Heat"
dan torell::10 more games... Regular season and the ECF...

dan torell::ahem....
dan torell::I'm there!
nba is the worst::"Good game 1 win in the reg season series for the heatles! Rose choking ruined the end!"  <b>ONWARD TO THE HORNETS BOARD<b></b></b>
Eternal_Sage::we killed it
prestige_worldwide_ceo::Stephen A. Smith ripped Wade today for babying LeBron and how he always defers to him..
dan torell::You listen to SA Smith? I don't know why ESPN hired him as an analyst... he talks crap.
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Offensive fouls suck period..
sokal-surf::I'll say this -- if Wade's flop-act and LeBron's travelling/charging routine were called-out 50% of the time, the Heat would have lost several close games...  That's not to say, the Heat can't win or won't win a championship.  But I am saying that it creates an unfair advantage for those two Academy Award winners versus other teams, especially in crunch time because no one wants to get close enough to guard them for fear of being whistled...
nabeel0550::lebron is one of the biggest actors though
dan torell::Because you hate him, that's why.
dan torell::Rose is an actor too... whenever he makes a drive, he flips head back as if he is hit by the defender.  NBA has a lot of actors and Rose is not an exception.
dan torell::hahaha... two of the best? you forgot Dirk Nowitski, dude.
sokal-surf::Yes, the NBA is a virtual acting class -- but the Heat have two of the best, and one mediocre actor.  The Celtics have a host of Golden Globe winners too...
brandonlee561heat::The only academy award winners are Sun Sports television crew, atm.
brandonlee561heat::lmao
nba is the worst::Regional academy award winners (like ref job titles) are overrated
Eternal_Sage::and rose's  flops?
MJ__The ___GREATEST::nba DICTATOR, david stern,  is making sure that Miami HYPE, HOOPLA, Propaganda &amp; BANDWAGON moves forward without interruption.  Second "win" in few days - delivered to Miami as PRESENT from DICTATOR stern and his loyal servants - referees in charge for Miami's game
dan torell::Conspiracy theory again? Geez....
nba is the worst::Facts &gt; theories
sokal-surf::Isn't someone going to breakout the old "the Heat are the ONLY team in the league that drives to the basket" argument?
MJ__The ___GREATEST::Truth is truth, no matter how you wish to twist it or deny it
Eternal_Sage::lol dude. how about the no charge on rose or the jump ball that should of been miamis ball?
MJ__The ___GREATEST::It will take a LONG time to list it all....    , but as you asked - go and watch last minute or two; even one of the biggest cheerleaders for Miami, (when foul was called on Taj Gibson ( after CLEAR block on Le BRICK) Van Gundy commented - this was "GOOD BLOCK " !
nba is the worst::40-28 fts, despite the heatles shooting more jumpers.
brandonlee561heat::Right, and the truth is that the Heat won :)
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Are talking to yourself now?...im confused
Eternal_Sage::answer me, how did the refs help miami with tie win?
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::OR!!!....  Maybe the heat is just good team... ever think of that.... &lt;--heat hater
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::LOL!... ill stay. but ill never like the heat  YOU know i love my lakers. lol.. although its looking like imma hve to choose a second team for the playoffs
Eternal_Sage::NOO STAY this is good! you passed the first step!
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::lol.... im leaving... lol
Eternal_Sage::*rubs eyes* you said something nice about miami? YOU EMBRACED YOUR TRUE SELF YAYAYA!!!
Eternal_Sage::show one bit of evidence the refs help miami with the iwn
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::RIP? when? i saw him try.. got scared and threw the ball up there
nba is the worst::False - Taj, Brewer, Hamilton all did
Eternal_Sage::lebron and wade both go to the basket.. only rose does that for  chicago
MJ__The ___GREATEST::It  will take a LONG time to list it all....  , but as you asked - go and watch last minute or two; even one of the biggest cheerleaders for Miami, (when foul was called   on Taj Gibson ( after CLEAR block on Le BRICK) Van Gundy commented - this was "GOOD BLOCK " !
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::I like Drose... but all the actin sh** in mid-air has to go.. and the refs werent callin it...good. i hate when players do that
nba is the worst::Bulls 3 more FGs, heatles 12 more fts = ft win.  Simple as that.
brandonlee561heat::Whatever helps you sleep at night.
D-Nice891::The media is a monster, instead of bashing rose and giving him the criticism he deserves, they release an article about how bad he feels about the loss to try and paint some picture of him being a competitor. If it were Lebron, he would be getting destroyed by national media right now. Being called a selfish ball hog for not passing the rock to rip hamilton and bricking those free throws. People need to stop coddling Drose. The kid isn't squeaky clean, I like him but he cheated his way into college. Lets be honest here..
11Golden07::I agree about DRose. If people want to make an argument for best player in the NBA, then he needs to be held to the same standard as Lebron. Lebron would get hammered if he went 12 for 28 with missed free throws and a bricked shot at the end.
nabeel0550::I don't think Rose deserves too much criticism though
dan torell::So as Lebron....
Eternal_Sage::that's true, one thing i will say this. I disagree with how he did his descion then I facepalm when he got mad people didn't like him after he did it *sigh* Duncan for the win
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Yeah... but gotta understand.. Lebron made everyone not like him..
MJ__The ___GREATEST::Miami and Le BRICK should be very THANKFUL to referee crew for this , so called "win".
11Golden07::First, It is hard to ref in the NBA....the game moves too fast. And secondly, the NBA has and always will give the calls to their stars. MJ, Magic, Kobe, Lebron, etc.
sokal-surf::You mean the refs with the "Heat" jerseys on -- those refs?  Notice how Miami's colors were white-n-black...
nba is the worst::It would end if more fans were outraged about it, instead of just parroting cliche's about attacking the rim, etc
dan torell::Blaming the refs again? When is this going to end...?????
dan torell::you can't expect the refs to do an unbiased job.  There will always be a unfairness.
MJ__The ___GREATEST::Until refs start doing FAIR &amp; UNBIASED job
Aicyla22::never
Eternal_Sage::... No
sokal-surf::This is serious question:  Has LeBron, to anyone's recollection, ever received a charging call?  Y' know, since he barrels through players with his shoulder and head down so often...
nba is the worst::Sure he has - but what's irritating is when he complains about it he NEVER gets a T
Eternal_Sage::sometimes, but superstars will get calls.
Eternal_Sage::yeah I even admit  a few time sit should be a charge lol
sokal-surf::Yeah, superstars get calls -- I think we can all agree on that.  But LeBron literally gets into a football stance and carries the ball through players, and the poor sap who's defending him on his back on the floor gets the foul.  I just don't get that kind of star treatment...
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Probably a couple times. But Lebron get away with alot of stuff.. ...a lot
nabeel0550::Exactly. He performs so many fouls but whenever he misses a shot or someone blocks him there must be a foul in his eyes and there usually is a unfair foul given to the person who shows lebron who's boss.
brandonlee561heat::Someone said something about Cole's 3-pt brick yesterday...  "THAT WAS DISGUSTING" -Stephen A. Smith
Eternal_Sage::top 5 players in the nba  Brian Scal Lebron James Bulls Mascot ME  Kobe
nabeel0550::oh crap i thought you were joking about scal but i thought me said mj for a second
Eternal_Sage::you people realize i put myself and brian scal in this.. IT'S SARCASM!!!!!!!!
Eternal_Sage::.&gt;.&gt;  I haha
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::LMAO!!!!!!   I heard once he turned white.. He was automatically given good credit and college degree..must be good to be white
Eternal_Sage::Michael Jackson was Black then he went white! It's like they say. Once you go White, get a tan!
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::YOU PEOPLE?!?!?!?!?!!?..........because im black ES? lol
nabeel0550::im sorry but i dont think lebron james is higher then kobe
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Fine!!
Eternal_Sage::I PUT ME IN THIS!1 shut up you
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::He's a Heat fan... Lebron is gonna be #1 in everything for him
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::really..........................im wayy better than Lebron
nba is the worst::1 = 3
nba is the worst::Haberstroh: Clutch time shooting (game w/in 5 pts under 5 mins): Bosh 16-for-27 59% | Wade 7-for-19 37% | LeBron 6-for-20 30% Chris Bosh's 4th quarter FG% this season: 57%. LeBron James? 44%. Dwyane Wade? 32%.
dan torell::who's the better defensive player... Lebron or Rose?
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Both are good a defense.. but they cant gaurd each other
ACandOJ::They can't guard each other for more than a quarter....That's why you don't see Sidekick guarding Rose before the 8 minute mark
dan torell::huh? they can't guard each other? I'm confused....
nabeel0550::i think Lebron. He seemed to do a good job on Rose a few times
Eternal_Sage::Lebron hands down   top 5 defensive players on the court yesterday  Lebron Wade Rose Noah Bosh
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Hey ES,   What was up with Lebron in the 4th?
dan torell::Clutch time or critical time is crucial... both choke for one reason... to much excitement.
nabeel0550::Same with Derick Rose
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::LOL... yea he did.. what was he like 12-12ft before those last two....talk about a big choke.. then that nasty floater he threw at the end too!! lol wow
Eternal_Sage::He chokes in the fourth.. but you know what. FIRST 3 QUARTERS HE = GODly
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::We will see.. only time can tell
Eternal_Sage::He may not be the complete package like a Jordan or Kobe will, doesn't mean he can't one day pass them. Because unlike Kobe. Lebron is a much better rebounder, passer and defense. Though if he can never get "the clutch gene" to quote skip bayless he won't be better then jordan
Eternal_Sage::yeah he seems to take it kind of easy
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::NBA- He had the one shot at the one point in the game....... lol   ES- True, question is now... will he get that missing key to his game? its been 9 yrs in the NBA and like 12yrs in the spotlight.. So none this is new to him.
Aicyla22::its better than it was in th beginning of the season i almost fell out of my chair when i saw him post up after halftime thats a major improvement for him but those BS jumpers have got to stop!
Eternal_Sage::I agree with people saying he is a stat stuffer, he will put up godly stats but I also think LEbron's mental state right now is not where it needs to be for him to take the final shot  The dude could be the ultimate player, if you just inject him with the final missing key and no one can stop him
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::I think Lebron only can do so much honestly.. Cause if you watched the game.. qauters 1-3..he could do anything he wants.. but the last Q gets him. Maybe he doesnt like the pressure.   ...than again he's no Kobe ;-)
nba is the worst::Cole brick almost broke the backboard yesterday - he's no closer
Eternal_Sage::quite honestly it could be one of the big three who closes which is fine. bosh closed the deal against the hawks and bulls lebron has done it before. I'm sure Wade will  they just gotta keep it ego free and they will be hard to beat
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Yea it was a sight to see.. BUT, you guys have the rest of the season to find the player who is going to be your closer.. Norris Cole?
dan torell::So... who's going to win between Hornets and the Heat? History tells us that when teams that are low %age in wins, Miami Heat fails.
Eternal_Sage::miami wins a nail bitter, bosh goes for 20 and 12
dan torell::Correct... he bites his fingers when he's on the bench while his team is loosing.
nba is the worst::Hmm - lebron is the nailbiter
Eternal_Sage::*facepalm*
dan torell::Hopefully Bosh doesn't bite his nails too much and ends up no fingers to hold the ball anymore.... haha
nba is the worst::Sounds about right - hard to think they cover -12
Khrizsto::what
LEBRONSTOMPSDROSE::Heat got NO tonight, should Lebron rest this game?
dan torell::Bench players are out for a blowout this game probably...
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::No why? he better not take no damn rest
ZachC1965::Love the alley oop dunk over Lucas...Kobe hasn't had a dunk like that in his entire career...
nabeel0550::oh so that dunk isnt all that anyway
nabeel0550::lucas is 5'11 but lebron is way taller then him anyway
Miami Heat fan since 2010::espn said 5'9
ACandOJ::Isn't Lucas like 5'9"?? It wasn't Vince dunking over Weis....
nabeel0550::He's had many. You havent watched him in his prime. Lebron hasnt made 48 pts with a torn wrist ever in a game
Lomax66::Thats what Lebron calls Bull Riding.

Eternal_Sage::Lol you really do, i rarely see you on the laker boards but outside of charlie and Julie they;'re all turrible
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::LOL... f**k the heat lol
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::No been when i touched it.. my hands burned
Eternal_Sage::Dude I sent a lebron jersey for you, signed BY THE KING HIMSELF? did you burst into flames? &gt;.&gt;
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::If Lebron wasnt on your team.. maybe
Eternal_Sage::IT'S OKAy! we know all those mean things you really say you love the heat! &gt;.&gt;
Miami Heat fan since 2010::wtf
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::hope so.. lol

BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::i ride a bike to work....
Miami Heat fan since 2010::guess you guys dont get your rims from the black market then...
brandonlee561heat::Yes, thank you! thats what i was trying to say. haha

nba is the worst::?
brandonlee561heat::This black lady that works in the same office building as me
LEBRONSTOMPSDROSE::It was a good game, maybe would have been better if Deng played, but I think the outcome would have been the same! D Rose choked last night against the Heat! He had Rip wide open for a shot in the corner but he wanted to try and play hero and lost the game!
Eternal_Sage::*puts min off his fab 5 after no goodbye*
BigX951::I join the Heat because I love to flame  Signed,   Lebron http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/431746_315883108447538_100000775551500_817954_1504000583_n.jpg
D-Nice891::People talk about Lebron choking, but that is half true half bull. I've seen lebron put on legendary 4th quarter performances. But Drose is another story, this is getting to be a serious problem. Dating back to his college days when he missed those fts in the championship game. Then last year in the ECF he missed crucial free throws and shot a terrible percentage in the fourth. Then yesterday, 29/29 this season on fts in the fourth quarter, then misses two of em? bizarre
dan torell::That's not bizarre at all.. that's the Miami Heat's new type of offense/defense. Blame the OU Football Coach for allowing them to use the spread offense style of game. But, players carrying their team on their back sometimes [clutch errors] will make them loose concentration. Lebron is no stranger to these issues.
dan torell::Maybe, but that's what the plan the Miami Heat is doing.
Lomax66::No, it isn't the Ducks style. It's Showtime brought back.
nba is the worst::Huge choke - 45 mins or not
Lomax66::Bulls lose to Miami "again", D Rose chokes yet, "again",.. D Rose cries in the locker room, realizing the Heat has stepped on his throat "again",.. and we still have to listen to Bulls fans whine and cry and make excuses. So transparent.
dan torell::Fans will always makes excuses... no difference than the Heat fans. That's transparent.
nba is the worst::"can make impact whoever he chooses the team he wants"?  I choose to ignore this
dan torell::of course, Lebron is a great player and can make impact whoever he chooses the team he wants. A lot of them are sour graping, but what can you do? Lebron's life is love/hate rollercoaster ride and we are part of it.
Lomax66::Bulls fans did so much yapping before the game. But have been complete excuse makers afterwards. Other cities are so jealous they didn't get Lebron and the boys. They talk and hate, yet would have welcomed thgem with the gold rimmed red carpet had they came to play for their town.
Aicyla22::what exactly is so transparent?
nba is the worst::You're on a roll - douche'
Lomax66::I bet you are one of those ignorant turds that wear baggy pants, your hat sideways, and talk ghettobonics with your hand on your little willy.
nba is the worst::"No go"?  I bet you're a myspace legend.
Lomax66::I believe you started the name calling.  No go hop on your raft and go home. This isn't the myspace hangout.
Aicyla22::and how old are you? with your childish comments?
Lomax66::Um,.. no. You must be one of those internet tough guys eh?  Go clean your room high school kid.
nba is the worst::Then try to act a bit more intelligent!
Lomax66::Um,... no.
nba is the worst::Please log off
Lomax66::Yeah, and your a toad, but i still like to be nice.
Aicyla22::youre an idiot
Lomax66::Hopefully your shirt if you'll let me pour some water on it.
nabeel0550::I still think Rose is the better player but he choked out yesterday but either way 34 ptd 6 reb 6 ast 1 stl and 1 blk still count
dan torell::Scoring during a game and your teammates aren't... that's a big difference.
Aicyla22::so jj didnt play at all last night right?
Eternal_Sage::will depend on the team jj will be in to beat up zones
nba is the worst::No, no Curry, harris, gladness or pittman either
Aicyla22::yes i agree theres only so many minutes to go around and harris plays like someone who has something to prove which is a good thing
nba is the worst::Harris has looked good when he's had the chance - but with Miller doing so well it's easy to understand him sitting
brandonlee561heat::Me too! From what I have seen, he hustles and rebounds pretty well. Harris, that is.
Aicyla22::id like to see harris play more idk how i feel about gladness just yet he has potential but i didnt know it was physically possible to be skinnier than bosh
nba is the worst::Must have been during a beer/restroom break - but I guess his 0/0/0/0 -3 stat line kind of speaks for itself
Aicyla22::hes useful against big slow teams
brandonlee561heat::Curry played two minutes too long
LEBRONSTOMPSDROSE::You're fine!
brandonlee561heat::Nope, sadly.

brandonlee561heat::cya
Cadillac_Too_Cold::Question to Heat fans, does pointing out that Rose is also a choker really make you feel better about Lebron's shortcomings in the final moments of games?
Eternal_Sage::yes, just becuase i'm insecure and I'm starving nad need food! ask this answer in 40 seconds
Eternal_Sage::FOOOD nah but I like to point out everyone chokes not just lebron to the anti-lebron food
Cadillac_Too_Cold::Well i respect the honest answer.

nabeel0550::He didnt cry he choked. He got too nervous and Lebron missed his shots as well
