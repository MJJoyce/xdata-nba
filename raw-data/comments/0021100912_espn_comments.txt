Rdhutchi::Best dunk montage I've seen in a while Check this out if you love dunks!!!!!!!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDc-di5kIek
Rdhutchi::Go Warriors.................eh it's tough to find any positive
Oaktown1029::Warrior basketball - a great time out!
coogsnation::if you want free tacos. f***king B****s***t
polocash::test
S F eleven::The Warriors must be one of the two or three worst franchises in the four major North American pro sports over the past two decades.
suzuki_is_the_man::Has there ever been a time when all 13 players play at least 11 minutes in a game?
Kobe is the MVP::I hope the Spurs play the Lakers in the semis.. if that's the case it's a sure ticket of the Lakers makin it to the conference finals!
dysfox::if kobe is not playing
The_Devlin::Spurs basketball is some of the most exciting to watch in my opinion.  I love watching solid team basketball....good passing, defensive rotations, etc.  The Spurs are one of the most exciting teams in the league to watch if you actually understand the game!
Stevo0429::agree 100%. Who cares about alley oops and no defense.
WrongfulSin::ESPN
manning48911::GS should  have never traded Monta Ellis
15steele15::Bulls lose to Wiz, Dallas loses, Thunder lose, and Spurs win to make West first seed......Great night for me.........
hochunk49::I like how when the Bulls lose its not news worthy. Damn bias ESPN!
WrongfulSin::That game was fun to watch, but the best part was when D Blair took that charge to deny the GS fans their tacos. Oh, and the part where there was only one person clapping in the whole arena at the end of the first quarter. I feel bad for the Warriors knowing they have no support from their "fans". Enjoy your lottery pick GS.
NOVABuffalo::Another boring win, it's great to be a Spurs fan.
GetEmJov::Good Game Spurs!  Got our starters some rest and still won.  I keep telling people that the Spurs are Title contenders.  Its funny how people say the Spurs are too old even though they only have 4 players 30 or over.  Spurs may be boring to some people but they keep winning and winning and winning.  Go Spurs.
JVicVega::Wow!  30 rbs was amazing, but to make it your name?? Really?!?!?!  I hope it was just for that comment...
Bynum Pulls Down 30::I think my ID sums the Spurs up nicely
kicked off again1::how did that work out when you rested your starters before the last lakers game?
15steele15::Dont need comments from someone who just made an account..
kobescored30butshot12for40::I found a betting system a few months back called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I found  this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it.Thought I would post this for anyone that is looking for a system that actually works
okc and bulls are bandwagoners_::Yawwwnnnnnnnnnnn  Thanks for the free sleeping aid Spurs!!
The_Devlin::I find solid team basketball exciting to watch.
Mikey2766::its a shame u find it boring.. u must be  one of these younger garbage basketball fans as the Spurs are one of the few teams left that actually play real team basketball.
okc and bulls are bandwagoners_::Very hurtful and also untrue.
15steele15::you are a troll (Member since April) and just talk crap that dont make sense.....or comments that have already been used....Lame....
GoofyTigre::I think you are a little late, troll. Most of us Spurs fans have left to go to sleep. Good night. (and stop liking your own posts. moron)
GoofyTigre::Troll, and good night.
okc and bulls are bandwagoners_::Please don't call me a troll. I merely try and spread the truth
okc and bulls are bandwagoners_::Its funny how Spurs are always boring
trademarktaz::Funny how the Spurs always have legitimate success. The Spurs are clearly a much better organization than all these constant west pretenders.
polocash::And 2 of the years we missed, we got Robinson and Duncan, so actually those 2 years were better than making playoffs.
The_Devlin::They have made the playoffs 30 times in their 34 year NBA existence....2nd only to the Lakers in that time period (Lakers have 32).
polocash::They have made playoffs every year since Duncan joined team.. = consistency
GoofyTigre::All you Gamblers: If you are wondering why the Warriors fouled a couple of times in the last 30 seconds please read this:  The Warriors have a promotion. If the Warriors score 100 points or more, the fans get free tacos. TACOS! And who wouldn't want TACOS? When Nate Robinson hit a 3 pointer to give them 99 points the fans that actually stuck around actually got into the game and cheered. Nate Robinson wanted to do something nice for the fans, so he decided to foul to get another attempt at getting to 100 points. FOR TACOS! The ensuing trip did not result in 100 points so he fouled again. FOR TACOS!  I know it may be the first time you have ever seen a NBA player actually do something nice for his team's fans, but that is what happened. I am sorry that this may have caused you to lose your bet, but you know what? If you would have bet the opposite, you would have won and would not be complaining right now. Silly Gamblers! TACOS WERE INVOLVED!!
coogsnation::$@%! the tacos. If they couln't score 100 against JV litlle leaguers then screw them. $@%!$@ $@%!$@%!. I'm still pissed
polocash::Vegas Times Headlines "Tacos, or lack of, save Vegas Casinos tons of Cash"
GoofyTigre::I've lost my share of bets on crazy last second shenanigans in basketball. the only difference between me and them is that I move on, I don't complain at my misfortune.
polocash::Screen play coming soon.
polocash::Just goes to prove there are no sure bets!! Well death and taxes.. But it does suck to lose to something like tacos.
GoofyTigre::Yeah.. I am making the abridged version here. It is somewhat of a summary of everything everyone has said up to this point. Oh yeah, and the Lakers suck.
polocash::I guess you didn't read the book below .... oh this is the short version!!
polocash::Fans leaving arena.. $%#@$ we lost and we don't get tacos... %^(*&amp;$#@  GS should have given tacos for charging them to watch this game
Bexindy55::I think destiny and a bit of continued bad 1st round match up luck is going to have Spurs paired with the Mavs in the 1st round.  I can just feel it.  If so its going to be a blood bath and all bets will be off in being the favorite.  Realistically the Spurs will come out of the series either winded or with a loss; the former really hindering their chances to make a deep playoff run.  As much as I don't want this to happen this is what the NBA is all about so gotta embrace it.  But man...if Denver somehow finishes with the 6th seed just punch the Lakers ticket to the 2nd round right away.
NOVABuffalo::Put your mortgage money on it ..... I will take the Spurs
SB47-Locker10::SPURS WILL BEAT MAVS !!
JohnChris109::Seen this sad act before from the 94945...The Warriors are an embarrassment to the NBA.  Tickets sat on the desk unused again tonight.  What a tank job.
polocash::GS starters are a JV team  also
coogsnation::You know its one thing to tank but to do it that obvious. I mean the spurs pretty much played their JV team and GSW couldn't throw it in ocean. If they could hit a few then we wouldn't be talking about tacos. Tanking sucks. And yes the Warriors are an embarrassment to the NBA
polocash::Bet on Spurs then!!
coogsnation::Vegas sets the lines. then you bet on them and they rig it so you lose. I'm convinced. I mean really. really. A foul with 4 seconds left down 19 points. Not only did they foul once. but twice. Conspiracy?
ImOldschool1964::A fool and his tacos are soon parted.
polocash::You never know what could lead to extra unnecessary points.. career night, records, tacos....
-mando-::haha...I enjoyed reading this conversation in it's entirety.  .......lol.....Tacos.....
polocash::Had they got 100 after 1st foul there would not have been a 2nd.. if there was enough clock there might have been a 3rd!!! lol
coogsnation::Okay first of all when the warriors are out of the playoff race. They have nothing to play for. They're been blown out by a JV Spurs team and fans want tacos. Most absurd thing I've heard. The first foul was okay. But the second was uncalled for. Yeah the fans wanted tacos. but WTF.
GoofyTigre::I didn't have anything riding on the game, so I am not looking at this through a gambler's glasses. I don't know how much I've lost because late foul shots because the game was on the line.. especially during March Madness. However, I did respect that I did lose because I made the wrong bet. I didn't complain for 2 hours on a Spurs board just to make myself feel better or get sympathy from other gamblers.
polocash::Announcer " 1 more point and you all get tacos".=. only standing ovation after "Star Spangled Banner"
GoofyTigre::Yup. Did you watch the game? If you did it was through a betting man's glasses. It was OBVIOUS Nate was trying to do a good thing for the fans. When he got it to 99 you could actually see the fans get into it and him respond by trying to give them what they wanted. Stupid Gambler.
GoofyTigre::Why can't he try to do something nice for the fans that sat through a blowout to cheer on him and the team? You are only mad because you lost your bet. I gamble and I know your pain right now. It is like a team that is down by 15 but still rushes down the court and hits a last second 3 to blow the under or the spread. Why the F*** did he have to shoot that last shot? Well, that sucks. I lost. Let's move on.
coogsnation::You are just like your handle goofy. Of course. You attempt to steal when the game is close. The game was out of hand. Worthless Nate Robinson, No wonder Celtics dropped him.
GoofyTigre::Attempt to get the steal first and then foul. Have you ever watched basketball before?
coogsnation::Yeah but why didn't he not foul right away. but wait until 4 seconds left. How can you get off a good shot with 4 seconds?
coogsnation::But $@%! like that makes you mad. I've rather them get blown out than to have that.
Dj2Hauter::Exactly!!! I may have understood the first foul, but the second one?? Come on!
polocash::Vote here.. tacos or rigging    Tacos 1
GoofyTigre::TACOS!
polocash::now you understand
coogsnation::Yeah. I'm the idiot for betting on the NBA.
polocash::Best bet... don't bet on things out of your control!
coogsnation::the game  was i control. Pop played his D League squad. there was 11 seconds left All he had to do is let the clock run out. But he fouled. Then shot a desperation heave to try to get tacos. Really? Really?
polocash::rigged would have had Spurs foul so they could get 100
Dj2Hauter::To add insult to injury, Pop had the Spurs put on a full court press.
polocash::fans were cheering for tacos after the announcer announces it, everyone knew, but you
GoofyTigre::TACOS TACOS TACOS. I know it is hard to believe that an NBA player would actually care about his fans. There was no rigging.
GoofyTigre::How are you so sure they were betting? The fans were CHEERING in the end of the game when they were within 1 point for TACOS. Did you even watch the game
polocash::They were hungry!!
coogsnation::Ain't no rigging. How you know Nate's mom or dad or cousins aint betting
Dj2Hauter::I am done betting on the NBA.  Stuff like this happens all the time! Meaningless 3's and fouls.  Bobcats fouled hornets down 6 with 4 seconds left.. 4 seconds.   Line -6.5? Delonte West jacks up a 3 down 5 at the buzzer.  And now this!!!  I have to get on the right side of the rigging
Paul5183::U should not get tacos if ur team loses. We dont get tacos in la if the lakers lose
GoofyTigre::TACOS. It all happened because of Tacos for the fans.
Paul5183::I lost money on that one too. The nba is so rigged. Who fouls twice down by 19
GoofyTigre::You have a serious problem if you were betting on the second half of a Spurs/Warriors game. Pop plays the bench, but the Spurs hardly have a JV squad bench. Their second and even some of their third team are solid players. When you have scorers three deep you will have games where they can keep scoring when the first team sits. Just because one player decides to do something nice for the crowd you are crying that you lost some money.. BOO HOO! I have no sympathy for you because you are GAMBLING on a late season NBA game.      :.-(
coogsnation::A few bucks. Man I can buy you and the few fans that showed up to watch the tank job warriors tacos and then some. Ridiculous
GoofyTigre::Awwwww.. Did coogsnation lose a few bucks.. poor coogsnation.
coogsnation::DJ I'm with you man. This NBA $@%! is getting ridiculous. I mean $@%! the tacos. They fouled not once but twice. If you can't make a freaking shot just plain $@%!$@%!
coogsnation::No you are the idiot. $@%! the tacos. Warriors suck $@%. they couldn't score against spurs scrubs. Game was over no need to foul
polocash::well the tacos are winning.. you shouldn't bet on games if you don't know 100 gets tacos!!!!!
polocash::trying to get to 100 pts so the fans could get tacos.. watch the game idiot
Santezie::go  lakers
Julian_h_Lyon::Spurs gonna send them Fakers to the tree of woe
SB47-Locker10::RICHARDS - Hanga- &amp; Bertans FUTURE SPURS !!!
Bexindy55::Typically I don't pay mind to this stuff but but judging by the majority of Laker fans' comments one would genuinely believe that they won the title last year.  Was there some sort of Truman Show conspiracy where they watched a different semifinals last year than everyone else or is collective amnesia and unfounded arrogance just that prominent?  I mean seriously.... They were swept last year emphatically and their 30 point plus loss in game 4 was probably the most humiliating thing I've seen in awhile.  To top it off they've got ghetto players like Bynum and Artest throwing cheap shots furthering their classless reputation.  I mean come on....How about some humility for once for Xst's sake!!!
Martin Rodriguez677::I think it's funny that ANY Spurs fans would be calling out ANY Lakers fans for being obnoxious, when 90% of the horrible trolls in here w/multiple acts that make the board unreadable, ARE Spurs fans. So that's #1. 2nd~THE Spurs havent won a title since 2007. Lakers have won TWO in that same timespan in a REPEAT. Something the Spurs have NEVER done. So yes, they have earned the right to talk a little louder than Spurs fans. #3~ Hanging your hat on ANOTHER team blowing out the Lakers in last years playoffs, is really silly. Whether you lose by 1 or 100, it's all the same. And being blown out like that, obviously did something for the Lakers' psyche that has led to improvement this year. Lets not forget that at the beginning of the year, the vast majority of the haters in here said the Lakers would suck under Brown, Kobe would be forced into retirement, and the Lakers would miss the playoffs. They are 3rd in the West right now and show no signs of dropping. Props to the Spurs for being #1 in the West. But at the same time, know that the Lakers and their fans have every reason to think they will be right there when the dust clears. Spurs have yet to prove they can emerge from the regular season and get it done, for 4 years running now.
Martin Rodriguez677::#1, 2, 3 ad infinitum~ I was not talking just about THIS board. I was talking about ALL of them in total. The majority of the trolls on ESPN NBA are NOT Lakers fans. It's not even worth debating. Next~ Dont know what YOUR point was in challenging MY POINT about the Spurs not winning it since 2007. I'll let YOU do the math and make the inferences. Hopefully they will be as objective and logical as anyone who ISNT a Spurs fan, viewing that same statistic. My point in stating the obvious in last years Mavs/Lakers series, is that even though to a non-Lakers fan, I'm sure it was earth-shatterng and team-defining. But as we can see, it really wasnt. Dallas has declined significantly and basically learned litle since their title run. Meanwhile the Lakers have improved, defying the odds and predictions of everyone who gleefully wrote them of last year as never competing for a title again w/o PJax, Kobe being done, missing the playoffs and so on. How anyone could believe that about a team that's won 5 titles with the same 3-5 guy crew is beyond me. But maybe the trolls here have access to some magical logic that I dont. Team for team, Id agree that bringing SJax back was a solid move for SA. Diaw, Mills, Neal, et al, are still wildcard commodities in this years playoffs on the bigger stage. And I could say the same about Sessions. Key difference being, Sessions has significantly improved the Lakers lineup to the point where PG defense isnt even mentioned anymore. And guys like Barnes, MWP and Gasol who rarely saw open shots in transition and sometimes even in the halfcourt, are now getting them thanks to Sessions. So pound for pound, the Lakers had to, and did, improve slightly more with Sessions. The Spurs didnt really need to improve all that much from their steady performances earlier this year while rotating Parker, Duncan and Manu out of the lineup as needed. That is very impressive. But even the most homer Spurs fan has to admit, even with their great record and consistency, there still has to be a bit of a perfect storm-scenario for SA to take it from wire to wire. And that's assuming that the East champ gets bruised and personel-depleted along the way. The Spurs really outdid themselves this year, no doubt. But for both them AND the Lakers, there's just too many quality teams standing in the way for both squads to be there at the end.
GoofyTigre::1st ~ The only trolls in here in a Spurs thread are the Lakers' fans, OKC fans and degenerate gamblers. 2nd ~ The Spurs haven't won it since 2007. That is correct. You are very astute. Your point?  3rd ~ I don't hang my hat on anything that happened in last year's playoffs. We lost to a bad match-up. And anybody that came out of the LA-DAL series was going to be Spurs enemy #1 the rest of the playoffs. Glad the Lakers lost. Sucks that the Mavs got to move on and eventually win. 4th ~ This year's Spurs team is completely different that last year's. With the addition of Diaw, Mills and Jackson at the trade deadline, we have more depth (and strength) than we have had in a long time. I do not look forward to the Lakers in the second or third round but I am sure we can handle it.
GoofyTigre::I am a Spurs Fan as well.. I thought you were a classless Mavs fan who was trying to post in a Spurs thread about beating the Lakers. I apologize. I enjoy bashing the Lakers when I have the opportunity. (and the Mavs)
Bexindy55::I'm a Spurs fan and a fan of watching the NBA.  I wasn't aware one could remember "too much" of something.  I just remember...it was an upset as well which makes it stick out much more.   I'm not trying to insult all Laker fans.  I know some of them have class.  The obnoxious ones really take the cake though.
GoofyTigre::I am not disagreeing with you at all Bex. It just seemed you remembered too much about that series. I was just questioning if you were a Mavs fan.
Bexindy55::Not hate, just the truth that you are apparently blinded from my friend.  It would do you some good to own up to it.
GoofyTigre::While I appreciate your Laker hate, I do have to question you: Are you a Dallas fan?
GoofyTigre::Riiiiiight.. No such thing. More like championship 2, Laker fan.
Santezie::day  one  laker  fan!!!!
GoofyTigre::What a great day in the NBA! Chicago loses. Dallas loses. OKC loses. Spurs win and only play their big 3 minimal minutes.
Banner41::Worst troll ever.....got beat down by his own post....epic
soo20fany::lmao what a fail troll
GoofyTigre::Do you want me to add all the rings each of them have together? it would be 10. 10 is more than your 9
GoofyTigre::I am proud of you that you can add. They actually have 2 rings together.. Duncan + Parker + Ginobili have 3 rings together..
GoofyTigre::lol.. really? they have 9 rings? seriously? nah.. you have to be joking. were you the one constantly posting the championship total in the Utah/Dallas thread also?
GoofyTigre::3 of Kobe's don't count though. those were Shaq's rings. they gave Kobe a ring because they had a little left over gold from making Shaq's rings that they could give him one.
JerryB1971::Duncan=4 rings, Parker=3 rings, Ginobili=3 rings = 10 rings. So what was your point?
Julian_h_Lyon::Timmy + Tony + Manu = 10
Santezie::kobe =5  bynum =2  gasol =2  which  is  9  can   u  add  my  friend  just asking?
Santezie::what  big three?  kobe + bynum + gasol =  9 rings  go  lakers  spurs  always  suck!!!!!!!
coogsnation::10 what? Tacos for dinner on Nate?
coogsnation::Yeah they're one and done once they hit 2nd round.
Santezie::no way!!!!
polocash::Duncan, Manu and Tony have 10
Frantismo::^^ Commenting from a mental institution^^
WeAreTheMIB::I'm going to have tacos for dinner tomorrow in honor of the Warriors and their 99 points tonight.
coogsnation::I'm having tacos for the whole month in honor of Nate
Jlovelakers4::Yeah they did mess up. So I do want to slap Nate Robinson. Why would you foul there. That was done deal, no reason to do it. Dumb!
coogsnation::Jlove, I feel your pain man. I lost 2nd half bet on GSW -1.5. $@%!$@% ridculous
coogsnation::And who gives tacos for free at NBA games. Ridiculous
GoofyTigre::or, OR he could have been trying to get the fans that pay for some of his salary. Or he was trying to screw YOU over because he heard you bet on GS 2nd half.
coogsnation::Yeah he was trying to screw me over. that SOB
GoofyTigre::For the first time in the NBA, a player was looking out for his fellow fans. geeze!
coogsnation::Yeah his mom must have bet on Spurs 2nd half
coogsnation::Didn't you see the fans were calling for tacos. $@%!$@% ridiculous
WeAreTheMIB::LOL the Spurs shot better from 3 than from 2 tonight.
machine260292::so who can we expect to play tomorrow???
WeAreTheMIB::The Lakers, DUH. ;-)
SteelersSpursDodgers::i think everyone plays tomorrow and none of the Big 3 play Wednesday
machine260292::why? i say spurs play nobody so they can get the "guaranteed" win wednesday
Jlovelakers4::How many points did San Antonio get in the 2nd half? 49 or 50? Thought it was at 50 but not espn say 49. ????
Santezie::against  my  lakers   about  30?
Jlovelakers4::Yeah the Lakers are looking solid right now but they have to play hard for 4 quarters. They tend to relax too much.
Santezie::well  as  long  as  our  bench play like  they  are playing get  them rings  ready!!!
GoofyTigre::Pretty sure they changed it to 70/50..
vicanzoo2@yahoo.com::ESPN $@%!$@ up...I almost choked out my bookie
Jlovelakers4::Yeah I hope it was 71 and 49. That works. 70 and 50 is terrible and makes me want to slap Nate R upside the head. Haha...
Santezie::lakers  front court  gonna  hurt  them spurs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  like  always!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!dont  even need  kobe  just  relax!!!!!!!!!!!!11
WeAreTheMIB::So, 71 and 49, then...
WeAreTheMIB::Yeah, the scoring is a bit messed up.  It was either 70 or 71 in the first half, depending on where you look.
Jlovelakers4::Thanks
SteelersSpursDodgers::49
vicanzoo2@yahoo.com::I need more jokes...I lost alot of $$$$ today!
coogsnation::Yeah Lil Nate was so hungry he fouled so he could get last shot for tacos
