galingako::What time did halftime start?
galingako::Does anyone know.ty
Big 3 in Big D Dirk Deron and Dwight::Nets fans just mad Mavs are about to get Dwight and Deron Williams. Even Deron Williams said he likes to play in Dallas more then NJ. LMAO
shooter mcgavin14::mavs arent trading marion because cuban knows dwight is going to the nets, look it up jobber
shooter mcgavin14::i cant wait till dwight signs with the nets and i will be popping champagne and u will be crying like a chump
Big 3 in Big D Dirk Deron and Dwight::Last I checked Nets fan  21-16&gt; 11-26  Nets = Perrenial Lottery Team Mavs = Been to the Playoff every year since 2000 and to the NBA Finals twice and winning it last season
shooter mcgavin14::umm nets were in the finals 2wice this decade too. do some research b4 u talk ish. we didnt win one and u did i know, but dont act like we never been there and ur 2 final apearances r great when we been there 2wice too.  sad thing is ur such an ignorant nba fan i bet u didnt know nets were in the finals 2wice. we just didnt have a big man to stop shaq or duncan
dt6677::you guys have to stop ragging on Lamar. You would be grumpy too if you were married to Chloe Kardashian.
shooter mcgavin14::ur whole team is out of shape lol. thats what happens when ur the oldest team in the nba haha
Big 3 in Big D Dirk Deron and Dwight::Lamar Odom belongs in the D-League. He doesn't deserve to be a Mav if he plays like a out of shape lazy bum.
shooter mcgavin14::tell me about it. it must blow 2 marry a kardashian, but at least if u do marry one of the hot ones not the ugly one
DynastyinBigD::I feel bad for Dirk since he has to carry this team every night. Mark Cuban needs to bring some help for Dirk cause he can't be the only one shooting the ball while everyone else becomes lazy.
Big 3 in Big D Dirk Deron and Dwight::Jason Terry with only 2 points isn't going to cut it. I'm looking to the summer when the Mavs will have lots of cap space and can land 1 or 2 of the top free agents in the NBA. Just have to make sure no one gets traded by the March 15th deadline.
shooter mcgavin14::didnt we beat u the other night. nets wont do anything this year, i know. next year though we will have dwill dwight marshon lopez 2 1st rd picks in a very deep draft morrow farmar stevenson shawne williams of the bench with cap space to sign other free agents too. instant contenders. mavs will have dirk and no1 else. sorry
Big 3 in Big D Dirk Deron and Dwight::Who cares about the regular season victory. Nets are looking forward to the lottery like every other year
rosebeckham::the nets are $@%!$@ trash
shooter mcgavin14::u r a tool. i cant wait to dwight comes to the nets and ur dream big 3 is crushed. brooklyn is the future, dallas window has closed. props to them 4 getting a ring, but the window of opportunity is shutting fast.
Uncle_Rico24::2-peat? what 2-peat?
Big 3 in Big D Dirk Deron and Dwight::Lakers = 0-4 SWEPT
Uncle_Rico24::Just ask the Lakers, they did it. I hope you keep that name of yours when Dwight and Williams don't go to Dallas.
DynastyinBigD::Well the Lakers had a better roster then the Mavericks so you can't really make the comparison.
Big 3 in Big D Dirk Deron and Dwight::You trolls make it seem REPEATING is so easy to do
Tams92::Are the Mavs actually suffering with Lamar Odom? Surely this is a jest....

damn334::The mavericks are just not playing the kinda ball we expect of them. Jason Terry went off after the game it was insane http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZLsl4j6ZSk
surfcal76::lackers suck when they aren't loaded... your done. No Phil to bail your horrible teams. Lucky w/ Magic, shaq, kobe. Then what?
sportsmaniac1998::lakers are the 2nd or 1st best franchise in history so go suck a di.c.k I3UTTON
I3UTTON::haha thats all you got sportsmaniac? Lakers aint goin nowhere but downhill, so enjoy the ride!
pavypavs22::Dallas doesn't have the same team.  Thanks to Cubes!  He broke up a TEAM and a chance to go for a repeat.  Now, you're stuck with Lamar, Vince and the other losers.  Business men make great business deals, but terrible b-ball decisions.
I3UTTON::Lmao Lakers were a fluke 2 years ago...they beat an ancient Boston Celtics team. The Mavs beat a Heat team that actually had talent in the FInals
_mongo__slade_::umm....okay, if you say so, Oprah.
pavypavs22::There's NEVER been a fluke in the history of the universe.  Flukes are thought by people who can't succeed in life.  Success is easy in you have a TEAM that buys in to playing for each other!
_mongo__slade_::Cuban realized last year was.....a.....fluke.
_mongo__slade_::Mavs been in the toilet since the Lakers spanked that booty last week.
_mongo__slade_::Oprah don't know basketball...
I3UTTON::hahahahha ya i'm sure the Mavs will be wayyy worse with with 3 superstars on the same team. good analysis!
_mongo__slade_::Regular season is pretty important when you're only a coupla games away from missing the playoffs. That's the position the Mavs are in right now.
pavypavs22::Good luck with those losers!  Cancers!  You'll lose even more next year
I3UTTON::haha ya Cuban really "effed" us over giving us a good chance at landing D-Will and/or Dwight Howard this summer.
I3UTTON::its funny of all people, Laker fans are the ones who think the regular season is so important lol.... the number 1 and 2 seeds in the West didn't even make it to the WCF last year...whenever the Lakers beat the Mavs in a 7 game playoff series, get back at me
_mongo__slade_::How's that title working out for you THIS year? Mavs closer to missing the playoffs than the lakers...lol
pavypavs22::True dat, but same for Mavs!  Cubes f'd you guys over!!!
I3UTTON::haha yeah because the regular season means so much right? how'd that number 2 seed work out for you guys last year in the playoffs? sorry, Lakers aren't going anywhere without a point guard or a bench.
_mongo__slade_::Lakers 2-0 THIS season....
I3UTTON::yeah just like the Mavs spanked the Lakers in the playoffs last year right?
nascar goose::When Drew Brees leaves, the Saints will go back to being nobodies.
winterfresh98::Mavs are the defending chumps
Luro26::nah
_mongo__slade_::I give the Mavs credit. They got hot at the right time &amp; rode it to the title. But even Cuban knows it was a fluke; that's why he started blowing it up as soon as he could...
The WhoDat Cat::You should really think about what you're saying. How can a championship for any team be a fluke? It's the hardest thing to do in professional sports. If you achieve the ultimate challenge, it's not a fluke. It means you worked harder than the opposing team.
sportsmaniac1998::mavs were the 3 seed
I3UTTON::And if the Mavs get D-Will then the Lakers will need a point guard whos more than just "competent" to compete with the Mavs next year. so good luck with that!
I3UTTON::Mavs will the make the playoffs just like they have the last 11 years, i aint even worried about that lol
_mongo__slade_::lmao...if you're the 9th seed, it matters a WHOLE lot.  The don't need DWill either. Just a competent guy who can defend &amp; shoot. Don't need a max contract guy to fill that role.
I3UTTON::Yeah but you guys definitely could use D-Will seeing you have a glaring weakness at point guard.  and last i checked, seeding doesn't matter in the playoffs....how quickly you forget what the number 4 seed Mavs did to your number 2 seed Lakers last year in the playoffs LMAO
_mongo__slade_::Lakers don't need Howard; center position isn't an issue. They just need a coupla shooters. And last I checked, Mavs are closer to the 9th seed than the Lakers right now.
I3UTTON::first of all I've never said that in my life lol. secondly, your Lakers are worse off than the Mavs right now. At least the Mavs have a bench this year. And third, at least the Mavs have a legit shot to land D-Will and/or Dwight Howard. You guys on the other hand have zero chance of landing either one. So good luck with that Kobe contract taking up all your salary cap space and not having any depth.
_mongo__slade_::Like you guys always tell Laker fans...stop living in the past. Mavs don't have it this year &amp; if you don't land Howard &amp; Williams then it's adios muchachos for a looonnngggg time. Good luck with that.
I3UTTON::lmao we had just that one game where we blasted you guys with three's. but thats your teams fault for not guarding the perimeter. bottom line you guys got swept, and sweeps aren't "flukes". especially when we didn't have Butler.
_mongo__slade_::He know's it's unlikely that a team will ever shoot like 60% from the arc again....
I3UTTON::because you also forget the Mavs won the Championship without their 2nd best player, Caron Butler, last year. So had we kept our team intact, we would've been even better this year with a healthy Butler.
I3UTTON::Short-term we would've been fine bringing back Tyson Chandler, Caron Butler, Stevenson, Barea,Rudy Fernandez, Brewer, etc. We would be best in the West right now with that roster, guaranteed. However, long term we probably wouldn't be great because our core is starting to age. the main reason Cuban wanted cap space is because he wants to form a younger and more talented core that will last even after Dirk retires.
_mongo__slade_::Man, just be happy that your owner is smarter than you  and he realized that it was what it was...a fluke. Otherwise, he would've kept those 4 guys he let walk for nothing.
I3UTTON::well then both of those championships were flukes then LMAO. how many times you guys beat a Heat team with the talent of Wade, Lebron, and Bosh in the Finals? exactly.
_mongo__slade_::umm....they won 2 of em. Guess it wasn't a fluke....LMAO!!!!
I3UTTON::let me re-phrase: if you call the Mavs championship a "fluke" then both of those Lakers championships were flukes too because they didn't beat a Heat team with the talent of Wade, Lebron, and Bosh in the Finals.
_mongo__slade_::It's not a fluke when you go to 3 straight finals my man. Big difference.
I3UTTON::yeah just like the Lakers were a fluke 2 years ago right? they got DESTROYED in the playoffs as the defending champs last year
I3UTTON::last i checked our Banner hanging in the rafters it said "Champions", but hey whatever helps ease your jealousy right!
Neme504::thank goodness the NBA vetoed our trade with the Lakers or we'd be stuck with Lamar Odom...whew...we may suck, but i'd hate to have the dude on the team and feel obligated to play him....he's still butt hurt from being shipped off from LA
Neme504::...and wifey's not too fond of it either
winterfresh98::hell no, not enough sun in the D, ha
winterfresh98::Lamar hates Dallas
_mongo__slade_::No gangs in Lamars neighborhood. But I bet it's humid as hell with mosquitoes big as poodles where he's at now.
Neme504::yeah, cause the original home of America's gang problem in LA is soooo much better...good job yall for inventing the Crips and Bloods out there...smh
_mongo__slade_::Nah, he just LOVES L.A. I'd be pis.sed too if I had to live down south...
_mongo__slade_::Dammit, I need the Mavs to WIN so the Lakers can use that pick! Mavs just can't get right. C'mon Lamar!!
jaad95h::so is Kobe not a shooter? stupid lakers...
winterfresh98::you guys are hurting for a pg
_mongo__slade_::Actually need a shooter more than anything. That's why we need that pick!! Stupid Mavs....
I3UTTON::have fun with Kobe, Gasol, Bynum and....... those are the only players i can think of on the Lakers
I3UTTON::i got news for ya, he averaged 14 and half points and nearly 10 rebounds a game in the postseason last year. that's basically the same numbers hes putting up this year.
_mongo__slade_::He was injured for a large chunk of the season. You see how he's playing now...huge difference.
I3UTTON::except he wasnt injured in the playoffs, he played in every game. and y'all still got whooped!
_mongo__slade_::Not when he's injured. Which has been all the time before this year.
I3UTTON::haha what are you talking about? the Center position in the NBA is WEAK. Of course he was top 5 last year.
_mongo__slade_::Bynum wasn't top 5 last year.
I3UTTON::haha worked pretty well for you guys last year in the playoffs right? NOT
_mongo__slade_::Each of em top 5 at their position. I'll take that.
wiqdgato::There's something stinky in that DAL locker room.
winterfresh98::it reeks of a senior home
I3UTTON::and it reeks of lamar odom
davejohnsonnola::How about that..... missing all the starters, playing two guys on 10 day contracts... way to go Monty and the Hornets!
winterfresh98::they also had Dirk back

I3UTTON::btw I for one like the Saints, so don't make me hate them with your trollishness lol
Neme504::lol...i for 2 like the Mavs...they're my #2...but when we play each other i gotta go with my home team....
gmyke71::Agreed
Neme504::no...knocking people out aint cheating...it's called handing out a butt whoopin...cheating is videotaping other teams practices...learn the definition of a word before u use it....

T8ke_A_Picture::Yeah like Mav fans don't come on the Thunder board. Only reason y'all haven't been on there lately, because the Thunder been smashing the league.
