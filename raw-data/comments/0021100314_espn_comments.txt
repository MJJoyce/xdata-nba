david508540::Thats it, Cousins must be traded. I cant stand seeing his big pouty baby like demeanor on the floor anymore. Everytime the other team makes a bucket, he sulkes to the out of bounds and looks like he is going to start crying. Trade him he obviously doesnt want tpo be here.
localsfgiantfan::And Kings will be in LA next year.
localsfgiantfan::Rush needs to play more. He's been fantastic all year. He needs more minutes!
Snakes22::Kings are wasting Jimmer.  Never seen a team with less of a team concept.  Tyreke is Allen Iverson incarnate.
david508540::Your right about the abscence of team chemistry. I never seen a team with less instincts than the Kings in the pro game.
david508540::Jimmer was a waste of a draft pick there buddy, get it straight now.
ZachC1965::How are they wasting Jimmer? Is he good at selling peanuts or something..?
sklater::As his point total/assist total started to climb over 3 games, his minutes suddenly started declining.
Cinnasnootzer::KNBR's Fitzgerald, for another season, talks up how close the Warriors are to contending.  Every year they look like, well, the Warriors.  He gets paid though.
NBA_refs_are_weak::when did JJ Hickson land on the kings? I thought the biggest reason the cavs werent able to land Amare 2 seasons ago was b/c the cavs didnt want to part with Hickson and the suns were asking for him. now hes in sac...seems silly
vandeman34::Curry is bigger joke than Melo
Jacobyjl::At least start Isaiah...  that way you can show your intentions before the game...
Jacobyjl::Fire coach Smart... The guy is a moron... I'm sorry but you do not draft the 10th player in the draft to sit him especially when he has been playing well.. the Kings were up with Jimmer in the game and would have won had they played him more minutes... Thomas does fine and will play for many years in the NBA but he is not Jimmer... Jimmer has an ability to score that needs to be nourished as well as schooled in the way he should play as an NBA point guard.. JImmer is great and will be very good someday... Smart is an idiot who thinks that a run and gun offense works...what was the last team that won a championship in that offense... oh yeah ... there wasn't one... play fredette you idiot and let the team evolve ... thats the only way you have a chance...my opinion the maloofs should fire that worthless coach and hire someone who knows real offense... you have the pieces just noone to put them together... grab sloan or  jeff van gundy and you can make this work.... Smart is lost without a paddle... the kings deserve what they get if they keep him much longer... fredette should be traded if you dont plan on playing him.... too good for a $@%! of a coach...
david508540::Jimmer is awful. he cant play defense and he makes every fourth shot. Terrible pick, Kings deserve to lose. Trade Cousins and his crybaby demeanor, cant stand him anymore.
JBurhenn253::isaiah has the ability to score as well. his college numbers werent as high as jimmers because he played with other nba prospects so he didnt need to score every bucket like jimmer did at byu. get over the fact that jimmer doesnt run the show
SB4LlFE::jimmer sucks.. get  over it
HiddenCounter::It's not like either of us are going to the playoffs.
CandySparker::
sirdavid83::watching kings basketball is really painful these days  they cant shoot cant pass and dont play d they suck
david508540::Couldnt have said it any better myself.
Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::I'm out, gn all. gg GSW. Go Kings!
PASS__THA__SWISHA::If you lost tonight, take Gold Coast United + 0.5 and the under in the Melbourne Victory-Gold Coast A-League soccer match that starts in a couple hours.

Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::what are your fav teams chad?
JeffKent4MVP::warriors, Sf giants, 49ers, Stanford cardinal
chadwi12::nope dags, i dont really root for GS, just cant root for a team who benches the guy who is the only reason im watching the game to begin with... cant hope they do well with him sidelined.  he would never return...not when he even gets yanked for playing good...  it shows just how stupid u r at being able to comprehend if u dont get that.... and too is used when u want to express an excessive amount... like my D*ck is too big... u catch my drift... if u r gonna play literary police on the espn boards, make sure ur not the idiot that incorrectly tries to correct  people when ur absolutely wrong..
chadwi12::so to answer u, u petty ace personal insulting $@%!$@, no, when he get axed even when he's playing well and the team is winning, u damn right i dont want them playing better without him... and they rarely ever do...
chadwi12::is that what happened tonight dumb ace... i'm down for rotation breathers...  he gets benched by a dumb ace coach... and the fans of this freekin team are so stupid they do not even get the calming effect he has on this selfish out of control squad
chadwi12::u r gonna tell me how to be a fan... do u really not understand how simple u morons are.... im freaking out because i enjoy watching him play... he deserves to play and he's not... that coach is a flipping idiot... and i can be pissed about it if i wont to... do i tell u how to be a fan... so damn stupid... all u morons do is slander and talk is if anyone disagrees with ur dumbace perceptions... u would think u have been getting that ace whipped long enough by now to want to  listen to other idea's... but no not u bozo's
Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::he helps the team but stop freaking out about his time
Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::so you can't root for a team that benches jimmer? so he has to play 48 min a game each game? wow
JeffKent4MVP::WTF Dwight got traded to the Bulls?!?!
Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::no
JeffKent4MVP::yeah thats insane!

Astrohusky::Great as a Washington fan to see IT and Nate going at it!  Nate kicking IT's shoe around when he lost it, too LOL.  Good games for both guys, bad game for coog Klay Thompsen who cooged it.  Fun all around in my book!
JeffKent4MVP::的知 not a fan of Kobe. I知 not somebody who looks up to him. I知 a grown man myself.-Stephen Jackson
chadwi12::a UK fan to.... man u get around...
jzalvarado::yeah im looking forward to try to make it a permanent stop rather than a temporary stop.  I love the Bay Area but too expensive.  Love Phoenix but too Hot.  Hated Houston..  Hated El Paso, TX (where I grew up).  Liked stops in Sacramento, Denver, and Fresno, CA but not enough to make them home
TheDags0513::The spring is the best. From your background, the summer will be easy. The people don't care if you drive a Toyota. Materialism is non existent. The majority of my family resides in LA or SF
jzalvarado::not yet.. first year in grad school.
TheDags0513::Sounds good. Good luck here. Hope it all works out.
jzalvarado::anyways lets do coffee sometime after I get to your area.  I'll email you my number
TheDags0513::My mother has passed away, but she was the white one. I don't fit in either. I feel white bc of how I grew up, but everyone places me in the Asian category. Very difficult for mixed people in this day and era. I have had people ask me to translate Korean for them bc I am "Oriental"...
jzalvarado::I would NOT volunteer but the internships that I do are Non-Income based Income as well as the Veteran Education benefits... so then I get a Federal Pell Grant.  So im waiting until next year to start working at that craft (when I receive taxable income)
jzalvarado::AHHH.  yeah its interesting.  Id love to converse with your mother about the whole issue.  More prevalent within the Filipino community when you talk about Asian-Americans.  The rudimentary problem for myself is that my Spanish is somewhat colloquial, but sometimes I fit in NO discernible group.  My friends vary.. Oh and most of them DONT like sports lol
TheDags0513::If you choose to volunteer here, you will also make some nice money. Translators are in demand.
TheDags0513::Oreo means mixed to Kentuckians.
TheDags0513::Sheya Sheaya (Sp. I know).. And that's all I know besides some gambling terms from the Chinese family poker games in LA. Trust me, I heard the same thing from my mom. My brother and sister in law do a lot of research on the Asian American life in the US and the psychological impact it has on them. Weird, because we are all Americans, just not white and pasty.
jzalvarado::major money IF not done on volunteer basis lol... Oreo?
jzalvarado::anyways I did a big term project on the issue of Colorism and the discrimination that occurs  through Latin America.  I still cringe when I hear my own mother say "That baby is so beautiful.. Its white with blue eyes."  I have to scold her LOL.  Yeah fluently, my side job is im a certified court interpreter here in the state of California.  I do it on a volunteer basis but that is major money.  I took a year of Mandarin ;)  I only remember how to say THank You and Big Dog/Little Dog (Dao Guo/Shao Guo?)
TheDags0513::I was called Oreo a lot
TheDags0513::Tell me about it. My father was full Chinese and I grew up in Kentucky. Talk about weird.
jzalvarado::but growing up was difficult because my father and by vitrtue most of my extended family hailed from almost a direct spanish lineage.  And on my moms side, my uncles and aunt are half white half mexican and they married caucasian and so I was the only brown kid on both sides of my family lol
TheDags0513::Big regret.
TheDags0513::Do you speak Spanish? I was never able to learn Chinese.
jzalvarado::MY father was born in the State of Jalisco in Mexico and my mother was born in the state of Chihuaha.  Thankfully my Grandma married a white guy and my mother was able to obtain full citizenship ;)
TheDags0513::Kidding, I think...
TheDags0513::Are you Vietnamese?
jzalvarado::presumptive.. i should change my nick and so should you LOL
TheDags0513::I could never handle boot camp!
jzalvarado::No.. not the same.. Ive had my education fully paid for because of my military veteran status ;)
TheDags0513::You, not being presumptive?
TheDags0513::Half Chinese, half Caucasian
TheDags0513::HEY, we all drop a little in our senior year. We are sick of school! I went to UK because I received in state tuition. I couldn't afford tuition and didn't want crazy loans. I am sure you are the same. Regardless, UK has the same credentials as other good schools and will get you where you want to go in life.
jzalvarado::whats your ethnicity if you dont mind me asking
jzalvarado::M.S. not MA
jzalvarado::sorry last sentence was meant as a completely separate point.  U K has a good MA program in Rehabilitative Counseling.  U of A 's is better ;)
jzalvarado::Since we're name droppin lol... I visited Darthmouth and loved it.. I wanted to go there halfway through my JR season of High School BUT then for some reason I hated school my senior year and that GPA dropped quickly lol.. but I grew up in a 100 percent Hispanic high school and the advantage to that is that it was a tad bit easier getting into a what u would consider a good school.  I was looking at U K for grad school
TheDags0513::As sad as it sounds now, PSU is a very nice campus too.
TheDags0513::I ended up at UK
TheDags0513::I visited Pepperdine. I wanted to go there. But Stanford still wins in my book.
jzalvarado::oh u mean Stanford.   Yeah its a very pretty campus.  Although I ve heard Pepperdine and UC Santa Barbara beat it only because of its proximity to the Pacific Ocean
TheDags0513::i would not want to be Willaims right now. The players disowned him after the first fumble. What happened after the second. The best environment in the country for fans that I ever experienced is Rupp Arena. Nothing like it.
TheDags0513::IDK, the main one is the one I visited, with the Thinker.
jzalvarado::which campus?
jzalvarado::the closest that ive ever felt is as a U of A fan, I despise ASU.  I despise them even more after the ASU grad (Kyle Williams) singlehandedly cost the 49ers the game this past weekend.  Growing up in El Paso, our biggest rivalry was New Mexico State University 40 miles up the road in las cruces New mexico.. BUT another rivalry was University of New Mexico and there was NO Better college atmosphere than going to the PIT in Albuquerque
TheDags0513::Did you go to Stanford?
TheDags0513::I bet he took the Derrick Rose route.
TheDags0513::Is it not the best campus in the US? Beautiful.
jzalvarado::Oh and Barry Sanders Jr committed to Stanford.  Only took him 7 times to get the acceptable SAT scoresto get into Stanford.
TheDags0513::UK basketball is very serious here and I am not being too serious.
TheDags0513::Pitino is Judas to Lexington natives. No lie. It's that serious.
jzalvarado::HA its so funny how different rivalries are up there..  Where I work at, its run by Stanford clinics, BUT the Stanford Cal banter during football rivalry week is hillarious in its camraderie.. Its almost like they look at each other and say "Ur Smart... No you're Smart... No you're SMART"
TheDags0513::If mentioning him, say extortion, Providence or enhancement.
TheDags0513::Good for you to know. Pitino is despised in Lexington. Never mention the name. Rule of thumb.
jzalvarado::Tim Floyd is now the coach at University of Texas at El Paso ;) So for me personally Im glad he was a failure.  ALTHOUGH i think the second time around in New Orleans he fared pretty well.  How did Rick Pitino fare his second go around ;)
TheDags0513::100% agree. He also had the best dunks in the dunk competition. If only he used that much energy in real games.
TheDags0513::LOL, Tim Floyd. How did he fare in the NBA?
jzalvarado::Still the best Dunk EVER EVER was that Vince Carter dunk over the poor French guy in the Olympics... That was just absolutely disgusting
jzalvarado::Ha!  and here I was trying to figure out your Iowa State connection..  Although Iowa State was sick when they had Tim Floyd as coach and Kelvin Kato manning the middle.  I thought that dude was gonna be a bonafide NBA center.
jzalvarado::32.. and I went through a complete career change (leaving the Air Force) and nearly two degrees worth of college credits switching majors about five times... before I got to this point LOL
TheDags0513::Then I decided that law school would turn me into a loser.
TheDags0513::I was a history major.
TheDags0513::Everyone does that and you served our country. Do you have your MSW?
jzalvarado::Well No.. My friend is an Accountant for Honeywell.  AND she is the biggest Ron Paul grassroots organizer I know in her region.  She's getting the word out SO thats helping AND her job flexibility allows it LOL
TheDags0513::28, You?
jzalvarado::yeah thats awesome.  How old are you if you dont mind me asking?
TheDags0513::Average rent is $850 but I own my house.
TheDags0513::My neighbor has her MSW and makes 6K a month, good for Cincy standards.
TheDags0513::Being an accountant is fine. I just wish I would have followed in my family's pathway of psychology and sociology.
Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::he roots for cousins and the kings, unlike you.
TheDags0513::And it's too again
TheDags0513::I see it.
jzalvarado::ha sorry posted below
TheDags0513::It's boring though. At least you are helping people. I just help a corporation
jzalvarado::oh thats awesome!  Someone's gotta do it lol.
TheDags0513::with stock options...
TheDags0513::We all wish we joined Google.
TheDags0513::I am a bean counter.
TheDags0513::My father held a PHD in Sociology. My mother received her masters and quit teaching to become an accountatn. To each their own.
jzalvarado::Google Employees... Me I wish ;)
jzalvarado::what do u do there in Cincinnatti
jzalvarado::LOL.. no not the Right Degree to make money, BUT I'm content.. My mind and intelligence level work towards career fields that pay alot less ie giving back to community type of jobs
TheDags0513::Read employee # 59. good book
TheDags0513::The Google employees... Overpaid
jzalvarado::They can charge for apartments at a premium and they'll be gobbled up...
TheDags0513::Just wait. You will get there. Right degree doing the right thing.
jzalvarado::no THAT u cannot but unfort for us little people with the tech boom at google and other startups.. youve got young entrepreneurs and engineers living it up in The City and then commuting to Silicon Valley every morning.  So prices in San Francisco are absolutely exorbitant
TheDags0513::My sister in law teaches at Stanford and my brother teaches at American.
TheDags0513::And thanks for your help. I know it has been a difficult war. Worse than Vietnam.
TheDags0513::It's ridiculous although the living is nice. You can't beat SF living.
jzalvarado::yeah im a vet myself too.. so I enjoy the environment.  I enjoyed this last stint here in the bay area, but with prices around the hospital for studios going for nearly 2000, i figured cost of living is lower.
TheDags0513::My brother and sister in law are psychologists in the Bay area.
TheDags0513::PTSD does exist and it is harmful to people.
TheDags0513::Good for you. Nice to see someone doing something good for people. There are so many homeless vets in the Cincy area who need help.
jzalvarado::kidding on the last question.  And i do an internship.  im working on a degree in rehabilitative counseling So i focus my internship towards VA hospitals
TheDags0513::Not kidding.
TheDags0513::It doesn't even compare. UK bball is king. don't wear your gear outside.
jzalvarado::are people more rabid about UK basketball than out here in the Bay Area with Cal and Stanford...
TheDags0513::What is your occupation?
TheDags0513::No soft buns with meat
TheDags0513::Vietnamese does not exist here yet. Sorry.
jzalvarado::yeah totally agree.. and probably not as delectable Vietnamese cuisine as Im used to out here in the Bay Area
TheDags0513::I miss animal style
TheDags0513::Get ready. It is here and waiting. But 5 Guys does not compare to in n out.
jzalvarado::Youve got 5 guys though as a consolation prize.. We dont have a Chick Fil A out here in the Bay Area
TheDags0513::...And the best Chinese food in the country.
TheDags0513::I can't argue. And I miss In n Out and Islands along with Redondo Beach.
jzalvarado::yeah but LA has got the beach to cool down in lol...
TheDags0513::The best weather in the country is spring in KY
TheDags0513::Humid and hot, similar to LA. But the spring is unforgettable.
TheDags0513::Great restaurants in Lex for fun: go to the mall: i forget the name: it's a bookstore that serves amazing desserts and has a great social atmosphere.
jzalvarado::oh and weather summer??
TheDags0513::But he brought the Reds back to the playoffs! You should actually go there in April. It is very nice.
jzalvarado::i refuse to set foot in Cincinnati until they FIRE Dusty Baker.  He singlehandedly cost the SF Giants a world series
TheDags0513::There are some great restaurants up here for all people
jzalvarado::lol I was actually looking at the Lexington Filipino association's website because most of my friends over here are Filipino ha
TheDags0513::Cincinnati, only an hour to drive.
jzalvarado::where is North?
TheDags0513::But come north for good food on the weekends.
TheDags0513::Is it one sided on race? Yes. Do they care? No. I live in N. KY now and am Asian. It's not so bad.
jzalvarado::I hope so.. Im going on a blind whim.. I m a bit worried that there is significantly less of My People's over there than in California but then again Ive always loved being part of different environments while i was in military
TheDags0513::Wouldn't make sense since I live in KY and Cousins played there, would it?
chadwi12::no comment dags back where u gave ur grammatical lesson...
TheDags0513::Sorry, are you rooting for GSW now?
TheDags0513::You rooted for GSW over Fredette.

Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::if davis can play the 4, then they could go for him. There isn't much as far as pg's go in the draft, so either a sf or pf is who they should go for
Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::okay
TheDags0513::Davis is too small right now to play a 5. He has to play a 4 until he gains weight.
TheDags0513::I am a UK fan too.
TheDags0513::But can he block a true NBA center 50 lbs under weight? No. He needs to gain lbs.
Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::he is a blocking machine. him and thompson would be good for pf

venom9247::yeah definitely....a much better looking team with certain fundamentals..  the defense is slowly improving i mean slowwllyy.....hes coaching well..
venom9247::yeah they are bad...i mean last year they would absolutely do nothingggg..  i mean jackson is trying to instill some sort of morals..hehe..  he switching it up with zone...trying to trap....  the team is scoring much less though
supe540::AAARGH.  The defense is worse not better.  They are 28th in defense.
TheDags0513::Doing well thus far. Great job Jackson.
supe540::They've only played 7 road games this year.  It's going to get worse not better.  Jackson has to learn how to coach down the stretch.
TheDags0513::Curry has been hurt and they have beat some decent teams. On and off, but showing promise.
supe540::Eh?
FriscoWarriors415::Warriors seriously need to trade monta before it is too late..
FriscoWarriors415::I agree with you, He is very inconsistant. And I think we could trade for him easily. Our starting lineup would be Curry Rush Granger lee ??? We still need a center cuz biedrens is horrible
jzalvarado::actually believe it or NOT i think D. Wright is the weak link. If we can get a Danny Granger in the lineup it would almost instantly make this team a play off contender.  D. Wright has morphed into a horrid defender since he joined the warriors
FriscoWarriors415::Its terrible. Trade him with d wright and biedrens to get a 3 and a 5
wonderlic.score::he's so inconsistent it hurts

sccfan352::glad the kings lost. huge kings fan, but we need one more good pick. not sure if having just tyreke and dmc is going to cut it.
socalagain::Anthony Davis?
TheDags0513::ALL the way, or MKG who can drive.
TheDags0513::If they don't amnesty Salmons, the GM is clueless.
jzalvarado::Sorry but this Warriors team is absolutely unwatchable.  At least Kings fans have IT Jr, Fredette, DCuz, and even Evans to look forward to.  We have Ekpe Udoh.
venom9247::yo you on crack....this team is prolly one of the more exciting teams to watch..  if your fan ....its frustrating as hell...  warriors fans go to the game...  kings area is fu.ckin empty and bankrupt man...  your an idiot....go to sleep..
socalagain::You guys have Ellis, Lee and Curry!
Loyal Aztecs Chargers Kings Padres Fan::BG and his dunk are overrated
TheDags0513::It was nice but I prefer the LBJ dunk over J lucas JR
venom9247::can the warriors make the playoffs?  i hope man....
49GiaWars::na uh
49GiaWars::mmm hm
venom9247::their defense is so ridiculously sh*tty at times ..  the kings three by thomas ...there was absolutely no reason rush would leave that guy....evans was under the basket with no shot
BigDtown09::Tyreke Evans is proof that stats don't matter. I've never seen a guy fill up a stat sheet so much, but it mean so little.
