billyblackwood::Thomas has to be in Rookie of the Year contention now.
DawgGawd206::I feel that the only fans on this board are the BYU vs Washington fans (i.e Jimmer fans vs. IT fans)
Chemical Huskies::Want more playing time? Play winning basketball. Guys are given chances, but no one in professional sports is entitled to anything. (I trust it's clear who I;m talking about)  Go Kings!
warkoch::ITT: Jimmer Jock Riders upset that I.T. is playing well. They actually don't care about the kings at all.
themightyrule10::SEATTLE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SACRAMENTO  FOREVER
Chemical Huskies::This is idiocy on blast
UteHawkeyeBronco2212::If Jimmer plays, the Kings win!
packfan21mt_Yanks_Jazz::Jimmer is more of a team player.... did i really just hear that?
UteHawkeyeBronco2212::You don't HERE things you HEAR things.  Moron!
Psychrates::You read it, and it's true.
packfan21mt_Yanks_Jazz::if you've ever seen him play he shoots the ball so much.
rosydobbles::I'm tellin ya, if the Kings played jimmer as much as they play IT, he'd have no problem matching IT's numbers...and probably beating them. And Jimmer's more of a team player. The Kings coaching staff is stupid wasting a bunch of talent like that.
kaptinkangaroo::Numbers aren't everything. Jimmer couldn't guard a shadow. At least IT can. He can also run the pick and roll ten times better than Jimmer since his feet aren't in concrete blocks.
JBurhenn253::funny that you mention the pick and roll, IT is top five in the league in both offensive pick and rolls and defensive pick and rolls. thats his game, he killed at washington with the pick and roll
JBurhenn253::Isaiah Thomas from Washington
markbw1989::Nobody in the NBA can guard a shadow....
packfan21mt_Yanks_Jazz::who is IT?
JBurhenn253::shut up. you have no way of predicting that jimmer would do any better than IT. the only thing that does matter is IT is playing and jimmer isnt. hypotheticals are a waste of time
golden state ITALY fan::NBA IS FIXED
golden state ITALY fan::Tim Donaghy --- 2002 --- THE END OF THE REAL NBA
N.E.Phillyfan::Did I tell you all that the Kings would win ??????!!!
packfan21mt_Yanks_Jazz::did someone tell you that nobody cares?
TAC0REV::List of players the Jazz need to trade away:  Jefferson Millsap Harris Miles Howard  It's time to focus on the future. This group of veterans is not getting it done. Play the youngsters and let them grow and develop for the future. Plus we need both lottery picks this year.
packfan21mt_Yanks_Jazz::r u kidding me? trade away our best players??? ya right. Keep millsap and if need be, ship jefferson and put favors as the starter and kanter can come off the bench for sap or favors. this would also give evens more minuets.
TheSportsMan411::Keep Millsap, trade Jefferson
johnnyx2011::Jimmer for Linsanity. Jimmer back to NY and Lin back to Cali.
packfan21mt_Yanks_Jazz::jimmer jimmer jimmer.... nobody cares
markbw1989::Actually a lot of people do...
Astrohusky::Revised game grades:  Cousins:  A (beast) Evans:  C+ (meh) JT:  A (Millsap 4 points and 2 rebounds in 25 minutes?  Talk about getting shut down!) Thornton:  A (scored and moved well off the ball) IT:  B+ (too many TOs)
pyril28::Cousins should have been ejected for throwing two elbows, but only one was called. He is the biggest cry baby in the NBA.
Charles55213::Utah might as well just tank and get the highest lottery pick possible
lockerseahawker::Isaiah Thomas &gt; Jammer
Astrohusky::It seems most of the Jimmer jock riders have given up, though there are still some left.
NWptown::Hmmm what a silly conversation board haha
david508540::Whats so funny?
david508540::Ohhhhh, just read the other comments, silly me.

HappyHappyJoyJoy000::k thanks
arsenal1470::I hope DMC stays with the Kings ...
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::me too
sac_squints::I think he will. He has done some interviews where he basically calls out this generation's players who leave their small market teams for big cities.
NOLA Sports::Why am I still up I have 350 problem test in Bio Genetics tomorrow oh well
FightingIrish595::well im extremely tired. im going to bed  pce mang
FightingIrish595::yeah it was like 35 to 10 or somethin like that
FightingIrish595::ND has nasty underclassmen dlinemen. purdue sucks
NOLA Sports::I went to a ND Purdue game this year Purdue got smacked
NOLA Sports::Lol yeah Purdue hasn't been good since Brees was there.
FightingIrish595::hopefully gunner wins. he can run. very underrated athlete. you personally know jaylon right
NOLA Sports::He likes Purdue ND and Florida(unfortunately)
FightingIrish595::jw. do you know if he is leaning towards ND. be nice if he stayed in state if u know what i mean
NOLA Sports::Yeah, why?
NOLA Sports::I just read him and Gunner have to compete for the starting job
FightingIrish595::rees already reached his cieling, he isnt the answer. gunner kiel should start
FightingIrish595::and they have gunner kiel now. hopefully he starts as a freshman
NOLA Sports::Rees is done hopefully, he has talent he just doesn't put it together
FightingIrish595::yeah rb should be about 6 ft.  if he gonna be 6-3 and not beef up, he should be a wide reciever. but if he knows how to be a line backer, like i said he should add about 30 pounds
FightingIrish595::sweet. hes got offers from like 20 schools. lol. be sweet if he could add about 30 pounds and maintain 4.4 speed. that would be absolutely insane
NOLA Sports::I'm not sure 6'3 works as an RB but Rees needs all the help he can get and the dude reminds me of AP but 6'3 is not good height for rb
FightingIrish595::rhats him right
NOLA Sports::Will be interesting to see him come up and hopefully go to ND
NOLA Sports::Yes sir
FightingIrish595::http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/_/id/141518/jaylon-smith
FightingIrish595::ur boy jaylon is a top 150 recruit. he 6/3 215
NOLA Sports::He plays RB right now as well but I expect him to beef up and play LB
NOLA Sports::Oh really?
FightingIrish595::yo
NOLA Sports::I'll pull a d rose
arsenal1470::JT + DMC could be the next Divac + Webber
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::I would love it
Chemical Huskies::As a Kings fan wanting the team to succeed:  On Jimmer - he simply looks overmatched and timid much of the time. Handling the ball, playing D, even passing up shots he would drain in college. I wouldn't have him handling the ball so much and play to his strength as a pure shooter to get him scoring again. Basically his confidence is shot because he's struggled early and the staff has to find a way to get him out of that mindset.
CDH11153::When I look at JF stats when he plays 25 or more minutes they are about equal to all the rookie PG in the league. All these rookies have talent or they would not be in the NBA .
sac_squints::I'm hoping that he works like crazy over the summer and comes back next season ready to kick $@%. The adjustment to the NBA is just going to take longer for him I think.
Astrohusky::That's what the Jazz announcers (that was the stream I had) were saying, he would take that shot in college.  Um...this ain't college, it's the en bee aye.
Astrohusky::Okay then, but IT owned the Pac too.
CDH11153::Yep your right!!!! In his 2 games against Arizona he had 82 points! But the MWC or WAC or whatever he conference he played in right
Astrohusky::UW, Arizona, and Cal have been the only good teams the last couple years, people beat up the other 9 teams and think they're good.
CDH11153::Did you see Jimmers record vs the PAC 12!!!
Astrohusky::Yeah and sure as hell ain't the WAC or MWC or whatever BYU is in.
BLazEdTrailerz::1stRowSports? lol. Same deal here man..
NOLA Sports::Walt Frazier was too fresh for his day damn
stankowski1::impecable, scintillating!
