WhatsgoodB::Dragic is a steal man......glad we had him
antwanarizona::I love seeing Grizz fans crying about the team, saying we can't even beat reserves! Well have you seen how Courtney, and Dragon have been playing? Like starters! Rockets have tons of depth. I look foward to seeing them in the playoffs. Unless of course my Suns don't sneak in (A long a shot)... Otherwise my season is over...
lamriverside7::D-fish killed the lakers! haha  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avHXtJPt88
MadmanMark14::Jk
MadmanMark14::Man the Grizzleys Suck all Grizzley fans should Fkng Kill themselves.

lmata1981::The Jazz lost, so the Rockets are now the 7 seed! But I should settle down though. I'd rather have the Rockets play against the Thunder in the first round rather than the Spurs.
vonsteve1668::I wouldn't.
BigPage25::GRIZZLIES are a bunch of underachievers i hope they dont make the playoffs
emthomasjr::Bad loss by the Grizzlies, good win for the Rockets.  Hopefully this is humbling enough at this point that our guys realize that every game counts, the playoffs are a given and you can't come into any game, even vs. a depleted squad, expecting to play 3 quarters of basketball and win.  The Bucks put up 121 vs. the Cavs.  I hope we don't think we are going to go to Milwaukee and try to outscore them (shooting 30%) tomorrow!
UHcougar_14::Rockets get the 5 seed???
Chompster777::hoping for spurs vs rockets 1st round series
3rdCoastTexan::anyone else see JJ Watt after the game with the Olajuwon jersey on :)
lmata1981::No, I don't get the Rockets here in Austin, ugh...
Liltexaschic::I missed it... love Watt tho
Seven13Hou::Good win Rockets Camby and The Bear inside looks disturbing ...lol
UHcougar_14::Rockets gonna upset the Thunder first round ;)
parlaybeater702::FYI....We won't know how stupid YOU ARE......IF U DONT PRESS POST
UHcougar_14::And please. Caps lock
UHcougar_14::Um why not compare them? They seem like pretty even teams to me
parlaybeater702::Once again ARE YOU THAT STUPID TO COMPARE THE ROCKETS TO THE LAKERS?
UHcougar_14::Tell that to the Lakers
parlaybeater702::FYI...The rockets will have to win on the road WHICH THEY CAN'T DO GENIUS
UHcougar_14::Lol. I think you need to look in the mirror bud
Liltexaschic::I'm still waiting for your logic although I won't disagree with your post lol
UHcougar_14::For some reason you call me irrational even though I actually back up what I say with facts. So actually, I think you are the irrational one
UHcougar_14::No need to back up your point? Actually you do have to if you want to win an argument
Liltexaschic::No need to back up my point...you just did it for me
UHcougar_14::No. Actually having valid points to back up my arguments, unlike you
UHcougar_14::? What are you talking about? My logic? I think I could teach you a thing or two about logic missy
parlaybeater702::Wow the grizz are a COMPLETE JOKE THIS YEAR!!!!.....Rockets are garbage &amp; still beat a healthy grizz team....I told you last year EVERY BUM TEAM WINS IN THE PLAYOFFS EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS....GRIZZ WONT MAKE THE PLAYOFFS THIS YEAR
HollaIfYaHEMI::The Rockets beat the Thunder and Lakers with the same lineup...
cutnshoot1985::Rockets are not garbage..they have been banged up and lack playing time together.  That explains their struggles to finish games...once they figure out how to win close games they will berally good.  Bunch of role players, no superstar.  Kmart need to get his $@% back playing
UHcougar_14::I think you accidentally pressed the Caps Lock button
lmata1981::Well done Rockets. We really needed that win. Now for three tough games against Indiana, in Chicago, and in L.A. for the Lakers. April doesn't get any easier for us, but we can handle it. Go Rockets!
gt1master_ike::Rockets are a nice up and coming team.  The grizzlies are a joke. Z bo back and they got worse.
bballguy2006::I think Courtney Lee is better than Kevin Martain. Wish houston would have traded him when they could have.
UHcougar_14::If only the Mavericks lost :(
Winnermama::The rockets will not make the playoffs.....Just because you beat sorry a## memphis doesn't mean your gonna make it
rleal13::Damn what a hater. I think the rockets must have beat his team down or something
parlaybeater702::Exactly.....See how good you are against the bulls without the league MVP LOL
parlaybeater702::The rockets could sweep the thunder &amp; spurs this year &amp; ONLY IDIOTS WOULD SAY THE ROCKETS ARE BETTER
UHcougar_14::We play Chicago on Monday. We'll see how we do against them
parlaybeater702::Right....People always say...The Heat, Bulls,Thunder,Spurs &amp; Rockets lol You sound dumb....please stop
UHcougar_14::Not exactly saying we're better, but we are definitely right up there with the top teams dumb@$$
parlaybeater702::So are you saying the rockets are better than those teams? The rockets are better than the grizz but the grizz are garbage...DO U WANT CREDIT FOR BEATING BUM TEAMS?
parlaybeater702::Right....The rockets suck so UR A BAD LOSS
UHcougar_14::The heat lost to the Bucks twice. Everyone has bad losses $@%!$@%
lmata1981::Very true. Now I just hope we can continue the trend when we go to Chicago on Monday.
parlaybeater702::Do I need to point out YOUR LOSSES?
UHcougar_14::We beat top notch teams a lot. It proves we can hang with anyone
Liltexaschic::Um Rockets have beat more than Memphis lmao...geez anger issues??? We even beat the thunder twice once without martin &amp; Lowry too ...same with the lakers lol
lmata1981::Beat the Spurs twice too...
UHcougar_14::Finally you say something logical
rocketsin05::Dude we are winning without our 2 top players. Give it a rest
UHcougar_14::^Troll alert
Madhouse_United::Rockets are a really impressive team at home. Curious to see how they do in the playoffs.
__InsertNameHere__::I just hope the do
__InsertNameHere__::A lot of people don't really know the talent and team play of the rockets. I just hope they can make the playoffs and show the world what they can really do with Kyle Lowry and Kevin Martin back. an upset wouldn't surprise me
Winnermama::Grizz are a complete joke.....Lose Gay for the year &amp; you win in the playoffs....Have him &amp; you can't even beat houston without martin &amp; lowry.......GRIZZ=1 YEAR WONDER BUMS
playadelCHI::TONY ALLEN son!!
Winnermama::That's weak they took it away
3rdCoastTexan::7 pts, 16 rebounds, 6 blocks for Camby
butabi bros::rockets will shock a lot of ppl  come playoff time
_FaGs__Suck_::memphis is a joke
kebojr::i concur and i am a grizz fan, i bought it last year boy i feel like a fool now
cpie433::Couldn't agree more.  Pathetic!
Benjamayne::god damn useless $@% houston $@%!$@ ugly $@% rockets. $@%!
Liltexaschic::Hmm
Adrianch01::haha
3rdCoastTexan::camby is a beast
Adrianch01::Camby is a beast (today)
reguster1881::zach knows the spread
Adrianch01::I guess the NBA doesn't want the Rockets in the playoffs..Oh well..lol..They're not going to do anything anyways...
Adrianch01::Gasol shoved Camby for that easy shot..
HennyAndCheetos::Bad no call
3rdCoastTexan::rockets never get any love from the refs...its a superstar league and the rockets dont have any superstars
kebojr::i wouldnt be suprised if memphis misses the playoffs, can't beat a suspect rockets team and this is by far the easiest game in a tough late season schedule, they had better hope dallas looses tonight
milankzs::why is Scola on the bench??
oscarzaragoza::Because Kevin McHale is smart enough to put him there.
HennyAndCheetos::They're getting a lot in the paint and he's not a good defender in there
3rdCoastTexan::he doesnt play defense
BCScomputer::what was that crap
HennyAndCheetos::Lee has so much hustle, love it.
wradtyler::block party
3rdCoastTexan::rockets defense is looking pretty stout
BetBasedLord::can memphis win this game???????? thoughts buddies
BCScomputer::shooting this bad.....nope
HennyAndCheetos::Rockets- 15 TOs Grizz- 7 TOs and we're up by 5, not bad.
Benjamayne::LETS GO MEMPHIS
KoolKeithDTown::Memphis done. Cant beat reserves. Pretenders.
BCScomputer::Grizzlies shooting 39% ....sucks
BetBasedLord::lets go memphis win this game!!!
BetBasedLord::play d memhpis and wi nthis game!!!!!!!!!
wradtyler::anyone know a site I can watch the game?
BCScomputer::Z Brick
HennyAndCheetos::Am I the only one who kinda misses Kevin Martin now?
HennyAndCheetos::I miss lowry too but Dragic is doing a good job, Its because Lee cant do what Martin can do...
Edudlufetips::no, though i miss lowry more, even though dragic is doing a fine job.
3rdCoastTexan::litle bit...still wish we would have traded him
