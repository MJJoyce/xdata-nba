Bexi1455::Its good to see Ginobs healthy for what seems like years.  He's been playing unconscious so far this season but other guys gotta step up if Spurs want a deep playoff run.
Julie.Again::Congrats to Pop and the Spurs.
motavation69::METAL SHOP!!!
adam_keefe_fan::This is freaking ridiculous, Tyrone. Raja Bell: 17 minutes, 0 points. Alec Burks: 3 minutes, 4 points. Hmmm...START BURKS, BENCH RAJA.  I wonder if Thurl Bailey can get to the guy...
spurscowboys1312::GO SPURS GO!!!
TomiRG::GInobili is a stud. He can impact games in so many different ways. Spurs fans must be really grateful they have such a quality player, we´ll miss you so much when you retire Manu. Such a unique player. By the way, talking about perfomances of different Spurs, I´m liking the effort Blair is puting, he is playing really good lately and has to keep it up, and also liked the four blocks of Splitter, that´s what Spurs need from him, not points, but interior defense and rebounding.
spurscowboys1312::yea, liking spitter is improving and blair is showing strong performance.
Garpo1964::Sit Jefferson and start Favors and the Jazz win.  Why go back to Jefferson the next game?
spurscowboys1312::send us favors, jazz :)
cSSk2011::and why is bell still starting?
prideofsa207::There is no way Utah wins this game....Lets try to keep it realistic.
LEONARD. WASHINGTON::will we ever see another manu ginobili?
CosmoKramer1444::James Harden. Sure they look different but their games are similar.
spurscowboys1312::if yes, i hope he's on the spurs.
neederlander::Look at the 3 point shooting:  it tells the whole story. Jazz: 2-16 Spurs: 10-16  The Jazz killed the Spurs on turnovers and blocks, but it's hard to make up a 24 point difference in 3 point shooting on the same number of shots.
prideofsa207::Jazz wouldnt have won....this is a 30 pt victory if the SPurs were stupid (thank God they are not), and let the starters keep playing.....dont kid yourselves.
rockandr2::all utah needed to do was have good defense on spur's 3s and they would have won...
lon3starstateofmind::Go Spurs Go!
TAC0REV::For how bad the Jazz shot and how amazing the Spurs were shooting, this could have been a hell of a lot worse. The Jazz are a work in progress. And Bell is getting way too much playing time
spurscowboys1312::favors looks promising
truetopia::Spurs all the way, baby!!!!!
joumon::Utah sucks. Is this rebuilding they want after firing JS and trading DW? Pathetic...
kingflash631::Why the &amp;$^* is Burks not getting more minutes?
cwa16547::Thanks for the win Spurs, I needed something good since my beloved Hoos lost their bowl game.
rockandr2::they need to put alec burks for a longer time!!!!!! he's going to be a amazing player if he gets more minutes!
spurscowboys1312::i keep my eye out for him
xuix::Tyrone Corbin's job security &lt; Obama's
glstreet1974::Extremely&lt; than the president's. Obama 2012!
Spurzoffury::True!
mystik-eye::Happy New Years Spurs fans!.....Go Lakers
spurscowboys1312::happy year laker and jazz fans!
rockandr2::Happy New year Jazz fans!
glstreet1974::Happy New year Lakers fans.  Looking forward to another tough match up as usual.
sjmcb160::I was about to say Howard played well but then I saw that he was 6-16.
TomiRG::I remember when Howard was really good in Dallas, not of All-Star calliber, but at least he was one of the top options ofensively for the Mavs, together with Nowitzki and Devin Harris. He had 20, 30 pts games easily. What happened to him afterwads that he decreased so much his production?
spurscowboys1312::yea i thought for sure howard was gonna be dirk's pippen
rockandr2::oh ya, it's all about the money now...
glstreet1974::Glad he choose the money in Utah over a chance to win with the Spurs.
rockandr2::he did better then he's ever done....18 points, pretty good for him
scow79::Yeah he wasn't really playing team basketball tonight or as I like to call it, he pulled an Al Jefferson
deathstar310::Tim Duncan is done. :( Steve Nash is done. :(
CosmoKramer1444::He would start on most teams in the NBA.
spurscowboys1312::tyson wishes he was half as good as Timmy.
spurscowboys1312::only dwight howard is better than Tim Duncan right now. his defense speaks volume. so does his passing skils. Duncan is Bill Russell of our era. enjoy him while we got him.
prideofsa207::Duncan is and has been a solid contributer....12 pts and 7-8 boards is in no way something bad....and more importantly, he is a prescence down low.
deathstar310::100% chance   Ty :)
Spurzoffury::Keep on dreaming!
Spurzoffury::Lakers have a better chance at winning a title than you do getting laid!
Spurzoffury::Difference is at least Duncan has a chance to win a title this year
spurscowboys1312::steve nash to the lakers be hella dangerous for rest of the league. yes steve can't play defense but he is a master on the offense side of the court. i will take 40 year old nash over derek fisher, whom i do respect alot too.
deathstar310::Umm idk. I like how the team is right now.  Steve Nash has no defense lol
forgetmenot433::Steve Nash to Lakers?
deathstar310::Lakers have a chance. lol
Spurzoffury::Yeah It might be Duncan'S last year, but you wish he would have been on your team!
spurscowboys1312::they're still too good. manu was real mvp last year, he got hurt early first round, that hurt the spurs. if he play the whole series, different series. props to grizz do', taking nothing away from y'all win.
deathstar310::In his prime years, yes. Couldn't stand those Spurs. They were too good.
Tebum::have a good new year's, see yall later
Spurzoffury::Happy 2012!
JazzFanFromINDIA::Why Corbin is not asked for the Burks Issue ??
scow79::Burks - 4 pts in 3 minutes Bell - 0 pts in 20 minutes
rockandr2::totally think burks needs more minutes!! i &lt;3 alec burks!
Spurzoffury::K we get it, happy new year!
BillOntario_337.4::<b>Have a terrific 2012 folks.  $@%</b>
Tebum::you too. see you at the NC game
Tyler Christensen::remind me again why bell is starting instead of burks, corbin should be fired
THEOCHO88888::spurs might win the championship in this shorten season.
