Action Dan::Pistons up by 13 I bet they blow it and lose yet another game where dominated the first half. That's been their problem the whole year. They relax a bit and forget how they shut down the opponent the first half.
David::The Suns really have to hit the boards hard. They can't afford to be out-rebounded anymore in this game.
Vlad::is billups injured. how come he doesnt play?
PKM::Only Robocop can save Detroit.
David::The Suns need to clamp down on defense. Then they can move the ball nicely on offense. If they don't let the Pistons score, they should win.
Anton::Like I said very early in the season, this Suns team is garbage and they have a good record because they have the easiest early schedule in the league. Gerald Green is getting lucky with his perimeter shooting and so are the Morris bums. Bledsoe is out for the season. Dragic is way overrated and Channing Fry is a 7 footer stuck in the 3 point line. Downhill from now onwards.
Harry Balls::On the entire team, the pistons have no good outside shooters. So they should stop taking them unless its late in the shot clock.
David::The Suns had better clamp down on defense. They need many stops and some baskets.
David::It looks like Phoenix will have to play their starting five and Marcus Morris the rest of the way in order to stand a chance of winning. Such is life. Reality sucks!
James::Did Markieff get hurt tonight or did he just not play much?
