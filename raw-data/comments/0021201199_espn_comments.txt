Salt Lake City Gal::yes
SCOOTERPOOT20::Missed playoffs for first time since '89-'90?Better check your facts homie.haha
dschnitz::What really got lost was the goodbye to Hugo the Hornet.  I will never forget his "bug on a windhield" jam at the mascot slam dunk contest a few years ago.  Goodbye Hugo, you won't be forgotten, a pelican just won't be the same....
ConvicedSince06_JamesGang::***PSA***THIS BOARD IS NOW WHITE HOT.....AND THE HEAT IS ON.....BE VERY AFFRAID....THE PLAYOFFS ARE ALMOST HERE!!!
krazb79::Congrats Dirk....
Jordanbetonbasketball1990-1998::Dirk was out 29 games. If they won a third of those, Lakers would be gone fishing
thel1195::If the mavs won just 2 or 3 of the many many close games they lost, or the many over time losses, the Lakers would be out.  Lots of missed opportunities
Jordanbetonbasketball1990-1998::Mavs have been in the playoffs since 89-90? Someone is sleep in the facts checking department
torrtis::Finally Mavs can shave, but most of them already did.
Barrk_40::oo they can cut their beards
fsuseminole88::FINALLYY butchering the hideous beards. big congrats to Dirk &amp; all he's done but also my Mavs closing out the season on a positive note*
eagles are forever ringlesss::so why not motivate yourself in a lost season?
kab747::I thought that the beard thing was stupid. They should know that they did not have it this season.
Horn1515::Congrats to Dirk.  A class act on and off the court.
Beanslams46::Dirk and the guys made the .500 pact in January and had no idea it would take this long. A better come-back than shark tank.
Hoeesayy::lol way to go Mavs, time to go to the barber shop!
Virtrue::it going to be weird seeing them without it now.
Beanslams46::Don't come a knockin, cuz this thread's a rockin'...almost 400 hits!, and it was hairy.
rodneycash2013::Finally, the mavs wont look fresh out of a Deliverance sequel.
Beanslams46::What a relief for the mavs....no longer have to return those calls from  ZZ TOP!
mbsIV::Even with all the deep playoff runs, I'd rate getting back to .500 this season as one of the bigger accomplishments in the Cuban era.  Way to go, guys!
Beanslams46::MAVS DID IT! .500! Shave them beards, Dirk didn't wait for the barber.. Cuban wants to braid the hairs and make a banner....
TexAugMan::Got our $@% whipped again!
MTorres727@gmail.com::Are VC and Mayo gonna shave?Because i thought VC never shaves
Beanslams46::Do I have to shave my beard? just had it permed.  --VC
brendandelany95::0.500, baby!  The Mavs did it!  Yeah, those beards are gone!  Woohoo!
nayan1119::Shavy time...shavy time. shavy time...ooohhh
travelingfan::Thank god they finally get to shave.
TheJTram::Chances are we're not going to resign Calderon so I guess yall can use him and yall can start Wright at the 5 spot
TeamworkToo::I almost didn't recognize Dirk.
TheJTram::And now the Mavs shall shave. Seriously though, congrats on getting back to .500
Aaron.Rob::Damn that was quick.
LetsGoMavs-::LOL Dirk already shaved
MTorres727@gmail.com::Now can we get over .500?Mavs CAN beat memphis if they dont blow a 20-30 pt lead and they can beat NO if they played the way they played today they can beat NO at home.
AZM91::I really feel that they should do 16 best records, not top 8 seeds from each conferences.  Mavs are WAY better of a team than Milwaukee, even WITH the injuries they went through.
wreckem tech101::Shoot, get Dale Harris to be the defense coach again.....i don't think even with him our rotation defense wasn't that bad.
joyhussain::dang he really wanted to get rid of the beard...
LetsGoMavs-::Dirk only 183 points away from Jerry West. Dirk IMO will be the 6th player in NBA History to reach 30,000!!! Just give him a good team next year Cuban!!
MTorres727@gmail.com::Maybe if Dirk plays for about 3 or 4 seasons.But remember Dirk is 34.
TheJTram::Pretty much they gotta massage Dirk's minutes to let's say 30-32 mpg
LetsGoMavs-::Dirk game doesn't rely on athleticism. All he needs to do is shoot 1 legged fadeaways and take 3 pointers. Mavs need to try to make Dirk the 2nd or 3rd best player on their team to prolong his career. Similar to Duncan in San Antonio
keithlebo123::dirk already clean shaven!  so great to see him shaving it already!  Great feat for the mavs to come back to 500... happy for them.
BleedRedandBlack93::I would rather sign Monta Ellis than Brandon Jennings.
FriscoMavsMan::Monta Ellis is not a PG
coolio198::lol no the hell hes not ellis is a chucker scoing a lot a points on bad shots.
BleedRedandBlack93::yea but he is a much better SG than Mayo
wreckem tech101::I think Monta Ellis is a one man show.....i don't think he'll be real good with another superstar IMO
BleedRedandBlack93::lol yea. pick and roll with dirk. I think Jose Calderon at the point and ellis at the 2, marrion @ 3 Dirk @4 and a center other than Bynum
wreckem tech101::haha J.J Barea back
BleedRedandBlack93::someone other than collison. he is much better coming off the bench
wreckem tech101::Collison?
BleedRedandBlack93::I think with a good passing PG ellis and Dirk can play good.
rioderoy::Jennings has more potential to me. Ellis you know what your gonna get not sure if he will be any better than what he is now. Jennings jury still out
BleedRedandBlack93::you know ellis can start shooting like crazy anytime and jennings most of the time shoots bricks.
wreckem tech101::I remember Dirks first few year in the NBA, when he got real good. I would hate when he cut his hair before the playoff started cause I think it would weaken his game. hahaha
power688::VEGAS CONTROL, MAN ,196 HAHAHAHHAHA
rioderoy::got it at 195 :)
AustinBeal::Congrats to the Mavs. They haven't had a very good season and Dirk missed a big amount of games, but atleast we'll no longer have to see those beards
FriscoMavsMan::If we lose to the Grizzlies next game, do we have to grow them back out?
MTorres727@gmail.com::I kinda like Dirks beard......
damixedone08::Jennings here we come and possibly Dwight?
FriscoMavsMan::Jennings is too small.  Carlisle likes big PG's so he can switch.
LetsGoMavs-::Jenning Tyreke evans Calderon Cp3 Ellis  So many choices this year than last year
Rexanilatorz::Why would we sign Brandon Jennings???
damixedone08::I like Jennings a very solid pg. I just don't see cp3 leaving. I hope we get him if we can.
HelloMyNameIsKendall::That's the fastest i've ever seen Dirk run.
wreckem tech101::His wife probably told him soon has you win, you go shave that nasty thing off.
captrobey::You got to be $@%!$@% kidding me 1 !$@%!$@ point the Over loses by
rioderoy::I got it at 195.. Early betting paid off for once
captrobey::At least someone got it
LETS.GET.WEIRD::u got a bad line
captrobey::When i bet it at Horizon it was at  196 when i tried to put my PW in it had gone up to 197 that fast
wreckem tech101::Thats excatly where Dirk was going for his clippers. hahaha
LetsGoMavs-::They should sell the beards. Especially Dirk and VC!
jmo08730::The only reason I care about this game...   Beards
Aaron.Rob::goodbye beards.
wreckem tech101::I heard Mark Cuban is gonna hit the FA market hard.  Mavs will be back in Finals contention real soon.
damixedone08::I hope all the teams know that if Dirk was in all year we would easily have been a 4-6 seed.
MTorres727@gmail.com::I think the 7th or 8th but not 1 or 2.
sysbaker1::C'mon shoot for the stars 1 or 2 seed for sure.
FriscoMavsMan::I think Akognon could dominate my rec league.
