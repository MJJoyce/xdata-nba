YoungJazzIsBuiltToKill::hi
FREE_TEBOW::Tebow?????
Bmarleys420::Using this bet system called sportsbettingstar. Ive been making around $3,000 each month following this system. You can find the system on google by searching the "basketball betting system."
thsker::Jamal Tinsely and Earl Watson combining for 48 minutes and Alec Burks getting 0 is insane, way to look towards the future Corbin.
Darkflame07::Corbin isn't looking toward the future, he wants to win now. Not winning=no job and tinsley and Watson are doing a good job right now. BTW burks last year had one of the worst assist rates in the NBA, you really want him playin pg?
deweyfbfreak::Good win Jazz. Honestly, the only thing that impressed me about New Orleans was Vasquez. That guy is a baller. Wish Utah had him at the point.
b.b.dave::Yaaa!   2 games over 500 having played 4 more on the road,   exactly the position we need to be in.
Tremors is the greatest movie of all time::I had to DVR this one tonight. Wow, that Jason Smith d-bag is a cheap piece of sh¡t. He also flopped three separate times but was rewarded with the call each time. I'm sure all 36 fans at the game would agree.
hockeygoon79::Jazz only got 12 free throws last time these two teams played each other. So shh.....
NolaJag::Are you really going to complain about the officiating when the refs give you 38 free throws, 17 more than the opposing team?.....seriously?  And you act as if no player on the Jazz has ever flopped before? Well that is quite a logical fallacy on your behalf.  I thought the officiating tonight was sub-par, and that they called too many fouls and wouldn't let the teams play, but by no means did the hornets deserve to win this game. Yet, by no means did the refs call this game towards the hornets, and also if Jason Smith flopped 3 times like you claim, then the league will probably notice (Though i highly believe that is an exaggeration).
Tremors is the greatest movie of all time::LOL. The comment wasn't meant to point out displeasure with the refs as it was to express my feelings toward a cheap, no-class punk and to make fun of the empty arena. The refs were equally awful on both sides.
scow79::What's going to be funny is watching Tinsley and Watson try to stay in front of Westbrook and Big Al and Millsap trying to stop him once he does.
Darkflame07::You say that as if they are the only ones who have trouble defending Westbrook.......
MBC32AMG350Z::If Mo plays, he would be a Better matchup, but as a Jazz fan, I don't expect them to win, all I expect is a good game, not a blowout.
JazzFanFromINDIA::Good Game Jazz !!!! Thunder are Next Stop !!!
hockeygoon79::Niners is obviously a bandwagon fan.
Niners4Lyfe5::You ready to lose by 30?
MBC32AMG350Z::I don't know about long night. They always seem to fight back. They probably won't win, but I highly doubt long night.
YoungJazzIsBuiltToKill::Jazz can't fix slow starts. Its going to be a long night.
scow79::They better not get out to yet another slow start or Niners is going to be right.
JoJoCrane14::Decent road win... Favors need more than just 17 minutes... Apparently Corbin doesn't want him to get better.  Interesting strategy, Cotton, lets see if it work out...
Darkflame07::Millsap had a great game last night, why take him out?
tydnorton::I would say he saw Milsap breaking out of his slump and wanted him to play through it
outdoorathletic801::It looks like there are about 75 people there
UtahQuad::It sure sounded empty, could hear the echos of the PA announcer, and it looked as though the entire upper bowl was empty. Kind of sad especially with all the effort that the owner went to , so he could save the team and keep it in NOLA.
JuMueller::You're being a little generous with that estimate
NolaJag::It's encouraging watch Vasquez play, but unfortunately no one helped him out tonight. Vasquez has to be in the running for Most Improved Player.
Kobe 6-24 Game 7 Finals::Jimmer should go to New Orleans to play. He should get minutes there if they are playing Rivers haha.
dwighthowardsamazing::Like with Warrick and Carroll but jimmer wouldn't be bench warmer here
KLOE416::Jimmer&gt;Rivers
NolaJag::Maybe we can trade Xavier Henry for him. Bench warmer swap
Kobe 6-24 Game 7 Finals::Jimmer is good if he has a good coach.
-STRAYA-::Whats wrong with Davis?
JuMueller::Stressed fracture in his unibrow
dwighthowardsamazing::But read an article that said he wants to play and has experienced no pain from it
NolaJag::Stress reaction in his ankle. He'll be back in a few weeks.
NolaJag::Yeah that's why they wont play him
-STRAYA-::Oh really, thats horrible for a big guy, if that turns into full stress fractures he is screwed
KLOE416::He's Injury prone
NolaJag::Everytime the hornets climb back in the game, they give up a 3 point play.
dwighthowardsamazing::These refs are horrible calling any contact not biased though calling it fair just everything
Kobe 6-24 Game 7 Finals::Jazz will find a way to blow this game.
MBC32AMG350Z::Yep, they found a way to blow this game, blow it wide open for an easy win. Unlike the Lakers who are blowing themselves in the foot by letting Kobe play Hero ball and not getting the ball inside. Yep, that's exactly how you ply second round exit ball. Keep it up Fakers
Backupformyipad::I wouldn't be surprised
KLOE416::Austin Rivers is absolutely garbage, why does Monty Williams give this kid minutes? He should be in the D-League
NolaJag::He played well against the Clippers. Consistency is his main issue, but that will get better over time....well hopefully that is.
JuMueller::they said the same with CJ "scrub" Miles
NolaJag::I have a strange feeling that niners4lyfe5 is up past his bedtime.
Niners4Lyfe5::U mad bro? I will be 10K richer after the game.
NolaJag::I honestly laugh every time i see the phrase, "you mad bro", especially when you replace "you" with "u"
Niners4Lyfe5::I have 25K on the Jazz tonight, b!tches!!!
clemenson92::25k to win 10k? Nice bet
tydnorton::How many points?
Niners4Lyfe5::That's just the ML.
Kobe 6-24 Game 7 Finals::Drug money?
Kobe 6-24 Game 7 Finals::Haha nice
Niners4Lyfe5::Of course!
-STRAYA-::Lol ok mate
Niners4Lyfe5::U mad? I'm gonna win 10K.
NBA544::best porn @ss?
Niners4Lyfe5::Your mom, hands down.
DavidColasurdo::what's the story with G.Hayward?
DavidColasurdo::So this is temporary I hope....
-STRAYA-::Hasn't hit a jumper since that game winner against Sac
tydnorton::He's in a slump
YoungJazzIsBuiltToKill::He has been terrible lately.
tydnorton::Does the NBA have mandatory games out for a concussion?
-STRAYA-::They shouldn't
higgibop23::or Three months
-STRAYA-::I doubt they would, every concussion is different, sometimes you are fine after 1 day, other times it takes 2 weeks
tydnorton::I agree, just wondering
Niners4Lyfe5::Do the Hornets have fans?
NolaJag::We at least have true fans. We don't bandwagon like the niners fans do
YoungJazzIsBuiltToKill::LOL ! you are a troll here !!! GTFO !!!
Niners4Lyfe5::Get back in the kitchen, b!tch!
Dandydanhansen::Wow Hornets crowd boo Cuz the refs stopped the game for a injured player. Pathetic
UtahQuad::The timeout was in fact a 30 second official timeout for injury, similar to those when a player has blood on him. That timeout is not called by either team, and is not charged to either team. Player safety, both with blood or other serious injury is the officials (and should be everyones) primary concern. But nice try @dwighthowardisamazing !
dwighthowardsamazing::It was a 20 second timeout
Dandydanhansen::Official timeout
dwighthowardsamazing::They booed because the jazz called a timeout not a ref stoppage
Dandydanhansen::Wow Hornets crowd boo Cuz the refs stopped the game for a injured player. Pathetic
YoungJazzIsBuiltToKill::LOL ! Refs stopped the fast break  :D
Niners4Lyfe5::The Jazz suck @ss!
Niners4Lyfe5::Why would I be mad? You guys are terrible.
YoungJazzIsBuiltToKill::Mad ?
NolaJag::Why did they stop the layup? You can't do that
Dandydanhansen::Ref hand book says players safety is priority  in that case and yes refs can call a time out whenever.. u guys need a break cuz your mad cuz they took your easy basket away. Forget the player who took a nasty fall forget about him I want 2 points..
Dandydanhansen::Ref hand book says players safety is priority  in that case and yes refs can call a time out whenever.. u guys need a break cuz your mad cuz they took your easy basket away. Forget the player who took a nasty fall forget about him I want 2 points..
tydnorton::It looked like Foye might of fouled
tydnorton::To stop marvin from being trampled
-STRAYA-::Foye was fouling anyway. No bucket was happening there
NolaJag::They can't stop a fastbreak like that though. You have to let that play out and then call an official timeout. That's an easy bucket they just took away
-STRAYA-::Lol at Hardens return to OKC. 1-11 and has been blocked 5 times
NolaJag::Dear gosh, how are we still in this game?
Niners4Lyfe5::You aren't. Don't be deceived.
tydnorton::This game is hard to watch
Barry660314::Why's robin taking that?
screamingreenz::Jazz are going with Randy Foye over Hayward?  Why?
JoJoCrane14::Because unlike Hayward, Foye can actually shoot
screamingreenz::Jazz were in this boat last year. If you arent winning with veterans, go young and win with them.  Losing with Veterans is a lose lose.
capnchuc::I agree, and the most frustrating thing is that our young guys are better than our veterans, so there is absolutely no downside to giving them the minutes they deserve.
capnchuc::I have no idea, Hayward is our best all around player imo
JazzFanFromINDIA::LOL !!! That was a near poster by Marvin !!!!
Niners4Lyfe5::India is the @$$hole of the planet.
Niners4Lyfe5::Since when did India acquire computers?
JazzFanFromINDIA::You are an as.shole of your mom !!!!
NolaJag::San Francisco is the gayest city in the country. And that's something you can't deny
Niners4Lyfe5::The Hornets are the biggest joke in the league.
NolaJag::That's not how you spell wizards
capnchuc::Both teams deserve to lose this awful game
JazzFanFromINDIA::Millsap is Sucking on Everything !!!! Man !!! Ugly Basketball.
screamingreenz::Note to everyone...if you have a Jazz player on your fantasy team, get rid of them as quick as you can.  Jazz and their 10 man rotation play down to any team they face.
capnchuc::That's cus Corby hates Favors and Hayward, if he didn't and actually played them, we would be a much better road team.
screamingreenz::I drafted Hayward thinking he would be the starting SF/SG, but he can barely get 20 mins a game.  Corbin intent on no one getting 30 mins (ex Jefferson).
capnchuc::Hayward might not be shooting well, but when he is out on the floor he does everything else well.
-STRAYA-::Is that why he has benched Millsap in the 4th for Favors lately? And Hayward has been playing pretty bad in the last few games, he is something like 2-17 or something
NolaJag::And just like that, it's a 4 point game
TrentLott69::Just went through a classic Hornets rut. Good thing their offense didn't really do much damage. Gonna be a good second half.
capnchuc::it makes me sad
capnchuc::Holy Hell, the Jazz starters suck
capnchuc::Why did Corbin bench our bench??? They were playing amazing Defense
TrentLott69::Not sure what's more pathetic, our lack of scoring or the Jazz's inability to completely capitalize on it.
JuMueller::I like sitting on meaty coc.k seats
TrentLott69::Yes
TrentLott69::The seats are really comfortable
-STRAYA-::are you 12?
JuMueller::dude are you gay?
Backupformyipad::Are these refs trying to keep the hornets in this game?
NolaJag::Yeah they haven't given the hornets a single free throw and the jazz 12. They are really throwing it to the hornets let me tell you.
JazzFanFromINDIA::WTF HAYWARD ??
TrentLott69::This quarter is pathetic! Come on, Hornets. Hopefully Greivis can get something going.
JazzFanFromINDIA::Jazz should have blown this team up till now !!!! SMH !!!
YoungJazzIsBuiltToKill::wow ! 3 fouls in the 1st minute of 2nd quarter ?
YoungJazzIsBuiltToKill::GO JAZZ :)
JuMueller::One of the ugliest quarters this season and we are still tied, guess this hornets team is garbage
TrentLott69::Good one.
TrentLott69::It doesn't bother me at all. I am just glad I don't live such a life where I J/O to stuff that happened 30 years ago.
JuMueller::lol fagt, do you even lift?
TrentLott69::That's fine. I realize that, but fans that harp on their records from 25 years ago are so ridiculous.
JuMueller::Your tears sustain me. Let me know how your team's pathetic legacy makes you feel at night when you cry yourself to sleep
TrentLott69::Y'alls record from 2004 doesn't mean anything. It is 2012, bro
mikeisildur::2012: Utah Jazz  8-7 New Orleans Hornets:  4-9
Ireland297::K your teams doing any better ? LOL stuck up Jazz fans
Eric62748::well....The Utah Jazz had winning seasons from 1985-1986 to 2003-2004; 19 consecutive seasons.  Its the most consecutive winning seasons by any team in the NBA. We have a history of winning.
