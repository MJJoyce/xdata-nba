Anton::Nuggets are finally playing like last year.
Conservatino::Mavs needs to improve its defense, especially Nowitzki. It needs to be more aggressive in offensive rebounding and blocking, and Blair can do better than Dalembert in this area. It also need more good forwards to help Nowitzki and Marion.
poyman::If Brothers is officiating the mavs might as well same the energy and forfeit the game... That guy is so anti-Mavericks and anti-anybodythat'swhite that you may as well not take the floor if he has a whistle in his mouth with his zebra shirt on.
Army::I found it so amusing how during the off-season, that those fans who weren't for trading Faried (Manimal), were for having him come off the bench.  7 of 7 from the floor, with 14 Repbounds.  Clearly, Faried is the best player on the Nuggets roster.  And Nuggets ownership is trying to trade him.  That makes perfect sense coming from this nuggets ownership
jammin400::Could yahoo mess up a live box score any more than this game?  Since about halfway through the 3rd, they have been lost with this game.
P. Scott::monta ellis...........great addition to the mavs!
fup duck::someone somewhere recently laughed at my pick of the Nuggets to make the playoffs, obviously they've never played full-court at 5200 ft
Conservatino::Mavs guards need creating more assists.
Pops::I love you rick Carlisle,  but shane larkin is not as good as mekel as your backup point guard
PKM::nuggets!
