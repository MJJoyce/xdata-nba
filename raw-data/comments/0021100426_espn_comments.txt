Paul96857::Yeah it was back when Ricky Nattiel played over there. Lin was there too. http://bit.ly/xGmF3d
jayeteee::YAY!!!!!!!!!
KUalum2008::Markieff has worked so hard to get where he is. I remember Bill Self talking about how big of a gym rat Kieff was and how much of a drive he has. I give the Suns a lot of credit for giving him the chance to prove himself. He looks real promising.
dannybuttercup::This was my first live NBA game. Great seats, the Pepsi Center is an incredible arena, and frankly, female Nuggets fans are smokin. I was hoping to see Nash in action, but overall it was an entertaining experience, especially with fans booing at the end of the game because the Nuggs were a point shy of 4 tacos for a buck.
thelawson07::HEY DENVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW'S IT FEEL WATCHING LIN-SANITY!?!? 24-7 COVERAGE ALL DAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.... PAYBACK FOR THE 4 WEEKS OF TEBOWMANIA OH IT'S SO BITTERSWEET.... KNICKS WITH LIN&gt;NUGGETS WILL EVER BE WITH GALLO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
jayeteee::Talk about making a mountain out of a mole hill, thelawson is not the sharpest tool in the shed. As a Nuggets fan, I find it enjoyable that Lin is doing what he's doing, and without Melo, and the fact the Knicks are winning, makes it even more enjoyable. And for Melo to say he can co-exist w/ the kid is just typical of what a self centered idiot Melo is. The Nuggets are doing fine, and it's just a shame there's always a lemming(thelawson07) still hanging on to yesterdays news.
thelawson07::Denver and NY have become somewhat of a rivalry because of the Melo trade = fact
thelawson07::TEBOW WILL LAST LONGER? In your dreams mr. shadow boxer you sneaky boy you. More points in his first 5 starts than any NBA player in F'ING HISTORY! and you're telling me Tebow and his disgusting completion % coupled with getting CARRIED by his defense is going to last longer than Lin who has SOLELY WON 6 STRAIGHT GAMES FOR THE KNICKS?!?!?!? You must be brainwashed by Tebowmania.
zosoMC::Why would Denver care about Lin? We're happily winning over here and actually in the playoff hunt.
dodgerblue2224::the knicks still suck they dont even have a winning record
Kamikazi02::It's a good story about Lin... I'm happy for both Tebow and Lin? We need more good story like this instead of bad May bad weather comments.
mountainboy33::I am enjoying it thank you. As a sports fan this is fun too watch. I am sorry your thoughts weren't the same on Tebow
OKCThunderswish35::why would denver fans care about Lin? i dont get it
thelawson07::think melo
Shadow_Boxer_WVU::idiot.. Who has he beat? A old lakers team.. ???one year wonder and he will be back to earth...He beat Nets Wiz Raptors to name three..Calm down! Tebow will last longer and so will the Nuggets thanks to the Knicks giving up too much for a overrated small forward
lshocket::Kobe system? I solved that in 1st grade.    -Jeremy Lin
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Btw, KCowling.  Here's a video about Cargo and Cuddyer.   http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=20094521&amp;topic_id=26016984
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Nice talking with everyone. Bye
PHX--SUNS::peace
tarheelsunc48::I never thought I would say this but Markieff Morris is actually showing promise. Now if only the Suns would do something about the rest of the bench, starting with ridding the team of the worthless Josh Childress...
PHX--SUNS::get rid of everyone on the bench except brown and morris
mountainboy33::So if hitting at 5,000 altitude has such an effect, than how was Ubaldo able to start with an ERA there of 0.90 until mid-June?
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Can't wait until April.  I love talking baseball.
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Ya, I agree that the D-Backs are the best team in the West until proven otherwise.  I'm not sure that Kennedy, Parra, J-Up are going to be able to duplicate the seasons that they had in 2011.
mountainboy33::and i commend for that. Well done. And your are right, Champs don't need excuses.
PHX--SUNS::we dont need any excuses. NL WEST CHAMPS!!
mountainboy33::Me too. Its going to be a long season though if divisional fans are already bringing up the excuse of the "altitude"
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Altitude isn't a huge factor anymore because of the humidor.  It's not nearly as much of a homerun park as it used to be.  The outfield is massive which is why it's beneficial to hitters.  It's why Todd Helton has a lot of doubles.
helmsey::I know the Nuggs won easily tonight but I still thought that they played pretty poorly.  I'm glad Afflalo finally remembered that the only time he can hit 3 pointers is when he is camped out in the corner.
helmsey::btw, i think all these injuries could be beneficial to a player like Afflalo that is now expected to step up.  It already looks like he is starting to get back on track.
kcowling20::That's what happens when Koufus and Faried start
Bad Sun::suns should go after Batum
sharkboy2421::I was expecting an easy win for the nuggs and im glad they delivered!
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Actually the Rockies did have a  good offseason.  Bats and fielding have improved.    (1) Dexter Fowler - CF (2) Marco Scutaro - 2B (3) Carlos Gonzalez - LF (4) Troy Tulowitzki - SS (5) Michael Cuddyer - RF (6) Todd Helton - 1B (7) Ramon Hernandez - C (8) Casey Blake - 3B  That is a much improved lineup from last season.  The big question is their rotation.  I'm guessing it will look like this: (1) Chacin (2) Guthrie (3) Nicasio (4) Pomeranz (5) Moscoso Additionally, De La Rosa should be back by early summer.
ryanvdonk::why is baseball talk in here? it's bad enough that it gets its own season, don't talk about it during basketball.
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Cuddyer has a great arm but not as much range.  It would make more sense for Cargo to play left and Cuddyer to play right.
kcowling20::Even if they tell him that, he won't stop playing the way he does. That's the way he is wired. And I love that about him.
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Wasn't he in center when he ran into the wall?  At least he caught the ball.  And I still think he'll be playing left, they just need to tell him not to run at full speed into walls.
kcowling20::I know that, but the Rockies might be weary of putting him out there in the space because of his injury last year. They know he won't stop for anything (ie, the wall) and he was in right last year after his injury.
kcowling20::I think Cargo will be playing RF this year.
mountainboy33::Its perfect for him and his rocket arm.
PHX--SUNS::Dbacks should have kept Carlos Gonzalez.. you can thank us for him
kcowling20::The altitude really does not have a huge effect. The thing that does, is the outfield. HR numbers are not even highest in the MLB. It's a doubles park, and thats because of the expansive outfield, not the altitude.
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Nah, Cargo is better.  Btw, Coors isn't really a homerun park anymore.  The field is huge and the humidor negates the altitude.  The reason it's a good hitters park is that the outfield is big enough to benefit gap hitters.  That's why the Toddfather has so many doubles.
mountainboy33::Remember the Blake Street Bombers? Ya, those days are past. look up the stats
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::^ I know
PHX--SUNS::its not a stereotype. its truth
kcowling20::Cargo is only 2 years older.
mountainboy33::I love how that is still a stereotype. The humidor has drastic effects on hitting numbers
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::I think people don't realize the potential Parra has. He is so young
kcowling20::Ian Stewart never did.
PHX--SUNS::well yeah hitting in 5,000 foot altitude the whole rockies lineup has MVP potential
mountainboy33::Cargo &gt; Parra. Parra had a great last year, but Cargo has MVP potential
PHX--SUNS::GOLD GLOVE!!
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::I don't mind, Parra is great
PHX--SUNS::oh yeah forgot he went to oakland before colo.. anyways he was a dback first
mountainboy33::Actually we can thank the knucklehead front office at Oakland
kcowling20::Thank you.
kcowling20::2nd base and 3rd base holes filled. Thank god.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Fowler destroyed the D'backs last year.   He makes me mad
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::I hope not, but he has a lot of speed
kcowling20::And he sucked the 1st half of the year. Fowler could explode this year.
mountainboy33::Beast line-up. I don't think people realize what injuries did to the Rockies last year
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Yep.  Cargo was injured a lot and Tulo missed some games.  Plus injuries to De La Rosa and Nicasio hurt the rockies immensely.  On top of that, players like Wigginton and Stewart had terrible seasons.  Rockies have filled some holes with solid players.
phatty3327::i have to say i was wrong about GK.  playing aaa really was the best thing to do.. playing through his drought hes now better than ever
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Hopefully Atrinsic, Inc. makes me more $$$
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::At least the Suns have a few young players with some good upside.
Orange602::Lopez
steviebizzle::They have Morris, and Gortat. Those are the only young players I can think with upside.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Gortat is a beast!
Forkitout24::I'm out. take care,
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::See you
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Orange, you ready for baseball?
Orange602::Even after trading Parker, the D'backs are still stacked with pitching talent in the minors
steviebizzle::Padres traded everything they had to get it, but their future does look bright with that farm system.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::I know. Can't wait
PHX--SUNS::we have Skaggs, Bauer, Corbin, Bradley in the minors and all have potential to be aces
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::I was.
steviebizzle::Yeah, and even though Parker had a ton of potential and it was only one game, I was not impressed with Parker's debut.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::The Padres farm is scary.
steviebizzle::Bauer is going to be awesome someday.
PHX--SUNS::his delivery is compared to Lincecum
steviebizzle::Our Outfield is going to be sick. And with Drew coming back, our defense will be set.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Don't remind me of that injury, it was nasty
PHX--SUNS::cant wait for Bauer to debut
Orange602::The pitching looks great as well, I hope Cahill comes up big for us
PHX--SUNS::Dbacks own the West. Upton for MVP
kcowling20::Nothing against AZ, but the DBacks could experience a year like the Rockies had last year. When you start winning, more and more expectations are put upon, and are hard to live up to.
kcowling20::The Rockies play their best when people don't fear them. Last year, they had a ton of expectations. When those expectations are low, like this year, they tend to surprise people.
steviebizzle::I am more scared of the Dodgers than the Rockies.
kcowling20::stevie, I was replying to PHX--SUNS. Sorry for any confusion.
Orange602::The Dodgers will be tough, Kemp killed the D'backs last year
kcowling20::Every team did in 2011. Nothing that special.
steviebizzle::I am an AZ fan.
PHX--SUNS::dbacks owned the rockies last year... literally made them their b*tch
kcowling20::I think almost everyone would as well, except AZ fans.
steviebizzle::I will agree with kcowling that the Dodgers will be better. A lot better than the Rockies. Kemp and Kershaw are scary.
PHX--SUNS::of course a rockies fan would say that
kcowling20::Kemp and Tulo are both better than Upton.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::If he improves as much as he did last year, he ill be GREAT!
PHX--SUNS::youre right hes the best..... jk thats probably Kemp
kcowling20::He's not even the 2nd best player in the West.
kcowling20::Rockies had a good offseason. Taking the West this year..
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Lol
kcowling20::Yeah we are. Unless the Rockies sh*t the bed again and I get mad lol
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Lol. So are we all good?
kcowling20::Not really lol. 2011 was a lost year. Don't be surprised by anything.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::KC, remember when you and me had that huge argument?
Orange602::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
kcowling20::Everyone laughed at your team at the beginning of last year as well. I would think you guys would be the ones to know that anything can happen.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Lol
Orange602::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Orange602::yes, more than ready. I've already bought my new Joe Saunders jersey.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::^ I'm going to get a Kennedy jersey
steviebizzle::I think all of Arizona is ready.
steviebizzle::Just got back from a Valentine's date. Sad, but not surprised at the suns loss. I hate you Sarver.
DirtBaGP::suns + 18 with the tease. Pheww! fukkers almost blew it
kcowling20::Provided the Nuggets can survive for another month or so, they will be set up nice for the playoffs. Getting Gallo back and Chandler resigned will give this team a big boost come the middle of March. Hopefully they can stay afloat until then.
bunksplace::The Suns really put out a star studded lineup.  Why didn't Nash play?
Orange602::rest
North- of -49::for the love of God trade Nash for one last chance......he deserves it
PHX--SUNS::its Nashs decision you moron. he wants to stay in phx
Bad Sun::not gonna just give nash away.....
bunksplace::Would like to see him go out with a championship caliber team instead rotting away with the Suns.
PHX--SUNS::Suns need to tank it and go for Anthony Davis
Forkitout24::Danimal, did you get my KFC REQUEST?
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Yes. You should just get author blocker.
Forkitout24::I just will not reply. I put it all over Pac 12 board.  FYI.
