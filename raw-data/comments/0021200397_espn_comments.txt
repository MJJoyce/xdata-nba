hipma12::this game was a win win for me....
gwaller8::IU fan here to apologize for Jared Jeffries.  Sorry about all the NBA payroll he's stolen over the years.  One of the worst pros ever.  Ever.
youvotedforobamastoptalking::he's awful
Rip City Forever::Nice guy, good leader, no game
vandeman34::When I saw Lillard's mini picture here before draft I knew he's new maybe better Westbrook.
youvotedforobamastoptalking::are you mongoloid?
Rip City Forever::Better pg than Westbrook that's for sure. Westbrick is more of a shooting guard
POKEMON GOTTA CATCH THEM ALL.::man that blazers bench is horrible. worst talent.
Kobelies247::ITs nice to see this team win but dont get it confused with the playoffs please.......
Rip City Forever::Fugg off u band wagon hopper go root for the clippers
etony3312::127decibels Ignore Hickson, playing like a B E A S T ! ! !     Right now he's 6th in the entire NBA in rebounds and in December he's probably first (not sure where that stat is). He's also killing it in FG%, points scored, etc.    And get this...he's doing it all in only 28.5 mpg.    Blazers need to lock him down to a multi year deal. -- This doesn't count tonight's games, but... http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id=&amp;match=single&amp;year_min=2013&amp;year_max=2013&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;team_id=&amp;opp_id=&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;round_is_ec1=Y&amp;round_is_ecs=Y&amp;round_is_ecf=Y&amp;round_is_wc1=Y&amp;round_is_wcs=Y&amp;round_is_wcf=Y&amp;round_is_fin=Y&amp;game_num_type=&amp;game_num_min=&amp;game_num_max=&amp;game_month=12&amp;game_location=&amp;game_result=&amp;is_starter=&amp;is_active=&amp;is_hof=&amp;$@%_is_g=Y&amp;!$@_is_gf=Y&amp;%!$_is_f=Y&amp;@%!_is_fg=Y&amp;$@%_is_fc=Y&amp;!$@_is_c=Y&amp;%!$_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;order_by=trb  He's 22nd in total rebounds in December.
guiltykobe::22nd in total rebounds doesn't mean much because teams played different amount of games. you have to look at rpg.
Kobelies247::Ya cause portlands rep with giving players multi year deals has worked SO WELL for them in the past!   Dumb
JJWags::Dragic is still good I just hope the suns can get a real sg like archie goodwin to take pressure off of him but $@%! blazers fans we smoke you guys at the beginning of the season.
youvotedforobamastoptalking::what was that?
DISandDAT6::Go Blazers!!
b4373::SUNS LOSSSSSSSSSSSSSS HAHHHHAAHHAHHHHHHAAAAAHHHHHHAAAHHHH
License to Lillard::This game showed who's the contender and who's the pretender.
EmTeeZ::I'm pretty sure it just showed who's the slightly above .500 team and who's the under .500 team. Neither is contending for or pretending anything.
tgreen21::Kobe, worry about your loser of a team....
Kobelies247::lol huh?
Dadsterbug::Lakers win in OT!   Kobe sits &amp; Lakers catch up in 4th qte...Kobe takes 41 shots...makes 16...
Dadsterbug::"qtr"
Rob Parker 1st Take::Like I said...13-14
127decibels::Remember the debate before the draft? The debate was whether Lillard or Marshall would be the better NBA PG.  That controversy sure died down in a hurry.
youvotedforobamastoptalking::or keep in mind that he's clearly better.
sk0dawgs::keeping in mind DLill has the opportunity to play as much as he wants
amiller244::Throw Austin Rivers in there too...he's been disappointing as well.
Rip City Forever::Fugg ya it did
License to Lillard::You can't even post on the LAL-GSW board... So many trolls. LOL
127decibels::Hickson, playing like a B E A S T ! ! !   Right now he's 6th in the entire NBA in rebounds and in December he's probably first (not sure where that stat is).  He's also killing it in FG%, points scored, etc.  And get this...he's doing it all in only 28.5 mpg.  Blazers need to lock him down to a multi year deal.
Rip City Forever::Go golden state!
License to Lillard::Jarrett Jack...  Why couldn't you do this in Portland?
PortBlazerFan22::Ask Nate McMillian.
ivanolinghouse::I wanna see the front office extend Nikola Pekovic a nice fat offer. If he accepts we have a good center, if Minnie matches we screw em over! =D
127decibels::Again?   Minny's been trying to mess with the Blazers for a couple years.  First, we kept Nic and they got - nuttin' Second, they paid Roy handsomly Now if we could get Pek...  Karma baby!
License to Lillard::The LAL-GSW board is lagging... LOL
127decibels::Check this!   Portland is now 1/2 game out of 6th place in the West.  Oh, and those lakers? About to be 12-15...tied for 12th in the West!
ericp6565::lakers will be back in it
Rob Parker 1st Take::Like I said...13-14
Rob Parker 1st Take::13-14
127decibels::If you were a laker fan, the last place you'd want to be would be the laker board. Well, maybe the laker game would be the last place...but the board would be close.   Be gentle on him. Life is rough.
Rip City Forever::Is this a laker fan? Lets gang bang this fool!
Rip City Forever::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
License to Lillard::The LAL-GSW game is a good game.  Kobe's bricking like usual, too.
Rob Parker 1st Take::u came over here bc u were aggravated that the LA GS board is moving too fast
Rip City Forever::Or perhaps he is a blazer fan and its where he belongs...
Dadsterbug::Most fans don't know how good this win is unless you keep really weird stats over the years.  Ron Garretson has been a bugger for the Blazers for a long time.  Our record with him officiating is something like 5-35 over the last 40 games.  Let's take these wins wherever we can get them!     GO  BLAZERS!!!
Dadsterbug::Good one 127dec...chuckle winner!
127decibels::You can find it at www.suckynbarefs.com.
Rip City Forever::Haha not!
Rip City Forever::How do you find this information? That is just absurd. What a great ref huh?
Dadsterbug::And...his record with the Nuggets is actually worse.  I was talking with a Nuggs fan during that game &amp; he gave me his stats...it was like 3-33...or 3-36...can't remember.  Ronny G. just has it out for a few teams.  Several of the older refs do!  Of course the League will deny it &amp; say they don't keep records like that...but they're liars too!
ivanolinghouse::So who are your top FA to go after this next year?
ivanolinghouse::and a shallow draft. Best to trade off next years pick(s)
127decibels::If the Blazers keep this up, they won't have a first round pick.
127decibels::There's a deep FA pool next year.  http://www.hoopsworld.com/2013-nba-free-agents/
Rip City Forever::Thanks
127decibels::Rumors are Gortat might be available earlier. Portland is one of the rumored destinations. I'm just not sure what assets we would have to give up.
Rip City Forever::Hmm I want an athletic 2/3 who can shoot...and a center like gortat/Amundsen off the bench
amiller244::I'd take Gortat but not Amundson.
Rip City Forever::Any recommendations blazer fans?
127decibels::Portland has had it's share of bad breaks  the last few years.  But 2 very pleasant ones this year.  1. Lillard 2. Hickson  Thank you NJ/BKN and Sacramento!
amiller244::Even though they got D-Will, it wasn't the best trade for NJ/BKN. They still have at least a few pieces to go before they're a championship contender, and G. Wallace started to decline as soon as we traded him, not to mention they gave up a top 10 pick.
gina2bina::but c'mon he would be such a better fit as a 6man scoring punch. If we had a legit center presence and could move him to that spot in that rotation to absorb some of the bench minutes, we would be set!!
ClydeTheGlide_22::Wallace hasn't even been that good for the nets this year, and lillard has been amazing.
Rip City Forever::Makes it all the sweeter for us
demtral::Honestly I'm not sure which one is the bigger gift. Sacramento is just plain poorly run, that team is sadly never going to go anywhere. At least BKN had a reason for the bad decision.
Rip City Forever::True. They have d will. Sacramento just thought Thompson and cousins were the answer...turns out they were wrong
Rip City Forever::Agreed!
License to Lillard::WTF Jarrett Jack...
Rip City Forever::Jack is a blazer! Him and lillard are friends
Rip City Forever::Too bad we can't watch e-will he might have been that swing man that we needed
demtral::He would be the scoring threat off the bench we need.
Rip City Forever::Definitely. Dude is a freak athlete as well
ivanolinghouse::Any word on Elliot Williams making a return?
ivanolinghouse::bummer, so much potential there
AddictedtaQuak::yep
127decibels::IF he comes back at all, it won't be until late. Just got the boot off about a week ago.
demtral::He's done for the year I'm pretty sure
Rip City Forever::Thought he was out for the year?
License to Lillard::R.O.Y. is in the bag.  Now the ASG...
Rip City Forever::That would be stellar...ya never know! If the blazers keep playing well then there's a chance
AddictedtaQuak::Portland is fun to watch. Damian....you've got what it takes. Portland's a young team that loves to ball.
Ben Sheets could be the second half savior for the Braves::Hawks fan here...Damian Lillard ROY
shoot4-.500::I went to the NO game last week. left early and Lillard had a buzzer beater!! Damn!
Rip City Forever::Hahah noooooo!
Rip City Forever::You guys are doing good this year! But yup u already know cuddy!
Ben Sheets could be the second half savior for the Braves::Heck yeah we are. We'll be better next year though cause we'll be able to sign 2 max contracts, hopefully possibly CP3 and resign Smoove.
ThinYellowLine::Hickson's on a one year deal?  The guy is playing nuts.
shoot4-.500::looks a little like some D. Rodman hustle. Go JJ.
demtral::He needs to get paid
ThinYellowLine::He plays this way all year they gotta give him the mansion on the hill.
License to Lillard::The Lakers board is a troll haven...
shoot4-.500::Hickson is a beast. came out of nowhere last yr. cash in chips.
Rip City Forever::So good for us! Love how he works his tail off
Rip City Forever::And they're still losing with Nash! Ha!
ClydeTheGlide_22::it always is lol, no one can take the lakers seriously anymore
mdr2855::Lillard = rookie of da year
ivanolinghouse::7 Turnovers for Batum! Gonna have to fix that.
Rip City Forever::Sh-it he almost had a quad double
shoot4-.500::4 yrs in and #1 college pt. guard last yr.
shoot4-.500::almost triple double with the turnovers.
ClydeTheGlide_22::well he was close to a triple double at least.
ivanolinghouse::True, he leaves a big impact on the floor outside of scoring. Just wish that impact made me wring my hands less.
wayde1213::13 points 7 assists, 9 rebounds 2 steals. i can forgive the TO if you produce
Rip City Forever::I love lillard!
License to Lillard::Just a reminder, we will be 2.5 games better than the Lakers!
Rip City Forever::Hell yeah, I would like to see us make playoffs and them miss it!
wayde1213::portland 1/2 game out of 6th place
mdr2855::Go Blazers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
License to Lillard::RIP CITY UPRISE!!!  WHO IS B-ROY? WHO IS GREG ODEN?
mdr2855::Greg Oden works at Taco Bell
Rip City Forever::Love b Roy. But never heard of this oden?
Rip City Forever::Damian lillard is so good imagine how good he's gunna be next year
wayde1213::i hope just as good with some added extras, but knowing bball great rookie have a slight drop of there sophomore year
Rip City Forever::Not the case with b Roy and many others. Your comparison only works for a minority
sjsharks115::i f.ucking love watching teams scrape the Lakers night in and night out
dubzcheckem_22::AFTER THAT DISPLAY OF GRIT, I DONT THINK ANYONE IS STOPPING PHX THESE DAYS
nathan pool::still lost broosky
Orange6O2::Yep, this loss is a great learning experience for the team. They will use this to fuel their championship run.
dubzcheckem_22::13 in a row baby! We're on fire!
CARMELO4LIFE14::Blazers play hard i love it
License to Lillard::Who is Brandon Roy?
wayde1213::lakers lottery bound, blazers in playoff hunt
License to Lillard::&gt; Steve Nash
Broyripcity::And the kings tomorrow? Good. Good.
jackson0780::You should always buy the points blazer -2.5
TomLeee124::Fuckkkk offf
TomLeee124::Phoenix, hey jack, go fuckkkkk yourself all night long
Orange6O2::GG Blazer fans
Darius Miles::you saw me in the perfect score!?
tgreeson80::He is Darius Miles, more acclaim in his acting career than playing career.
Rip City Forever::Goog game
Darius Miles::$@%! you
Orange6O2::Not sure what is wrong with you, good sir
