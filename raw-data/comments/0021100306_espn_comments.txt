ZachC1965::Vince &gt;&gt;&gt; Kobe
nba is the worst::So Delonte scores 25 on 9-12 FG shooting and 5 of 6 from three-pt range, with 6 ast 2 stl - but ESPN says Wince "keyed the win" with 21 pts on 8-13/5-7 shooting 4 ast 2 stl.  Odd
TheGoodDoc365::You gotta watch the game before u start spewing garbage.....yes Vince did most of his scoring when the game was close, by the time Delonte caught fire, the game was already won.
Raptorel::That's because Vince keyed the win. Delonte started scoring well after the game was pretty much decided but Vince set the tone to winning. Delonte has been great though, I'm not taking anything away from him.
carlosv1919::sadd day for us suns fans,,,WHAT TO DO,,,IT SUCKS TO WATCH YOUR TEAM LOSE,,,BUT WHATS WORST IS KNOWING THAT THER IS A GUY AVAIL NAMED DWIGHT H,,WHY ROBERT SAVER WHY,,GO GET HIM YOU $@%!$@% THAT TRADED EVERYONE AWAY,,
MJ__The ___GREATEST::Road to NBA title still GOES through Dallas
Steaksauce651::STL Rams &gt; Dallas mavs
fastfootedone::impartial observer here -- I'm from where Steve Nash is from, so I've cheered for the Suns this past decade.   At this point, I can't understand why the Suns don't move Nash for pick or young players --- in doing that they would likely do a little worse this year, get a high pick and be able to build a bit quicker with good young pieces.  It would also be great for Nash to go to a team and have a last shot at winning --- we all know he's too classy to request it, so the team will have to just do it.  Curious to know if Suns fans are feeling this way?
BlazersWar::you know your team sucks when Dallas beats you with Dirk only scoring 10 points.
B.R.A.D.F.O.R.D::Thy're just stuck between a rock and a hard place. They didn't do much to improve their roster after last years struggles and still have their usual defensive struggles. Only thing is, now they're having offensive struggles as well which reflects their record.   My 2 cents... Don't "blow it up", but tear it down a bit and start rebuilding. Example: If you can get something for Nash, then trade him and get something before he becomes a free agent, leaves, and you get nothing. Besides, there are plenty of teams that would like the veteran leadership he can bring and for it the Suns could get a couple of young players for him.
Dirk2XMVP::The mavs are on a roll. Go Defending Nba Champ Mavs!!!
John Claytons Twin::Nice to see Vinsanity up to his old tricks.  Hope the over 30's on this team can stay healthy until playoffs.  Thats a lot to ask, but if healthy, they obviously have a deep playoff run in 'em :-)
Cowboys5XSuperBowlChamp::Good game by the Mavs
milw-jay::Oh. Steve Nash didnt play.  Now I understand....

Ron3758::I have bet on sports for a few years now and have gone through handicappers like women. Two months ago I found a system sportsbettingstar.com that is pretty decent. I have only lost 1 bet so far. It is a 2 game betting system were you double down if you lose the first bet. Im 30-1 doing this so far. Thought I would post this for anyone who is looking for a good handicapper

Hater_Player::False.
RSH089::Just blow this Suns team up already. Robert Sarver is one of the worst owners in sports history. He took a team that should have won a title or two by now and completely destroyed it. Now, he is refusing to rebuild by hanging on to an aging Steve Nash. Get a clue, Sarver, and sell this team to a real owner. Where have you gone, Jerry Colangelo?
Dallas fans are Trolls::wait a minute..did the mavs actually lose to the wolves twice this year already??? LMAO
