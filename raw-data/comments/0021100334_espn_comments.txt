ShaqLee_1::Steve Nash-0, Karl Malone-0, Barkley-0, Allen Iverson-0, Dominique Wilkins-0, Patrick Ewing. Can go on and on....doesn't mean S###. This players were way better than scalabrine, morrison, horry, fish. Get the F*** out of here with that.
edwinjacksonwinner::Wow, Dwight Howard's speech must have really inspired them to start winning.
nba is the worst::So have the Magic "kissed and made up"?
jamesstombaugh::Why, they beat 2 horrible teams and did not win convincingly

hawks14533::$@% you Howard..... have to make two freethrows right at the end of the game so i don't cover by half a point
Lance2545::I couldn't watch the game tonight, but how did J.J. play 23 minutes and not score a single point? Was he just shooting and missing or not a real factor in the offense tonight?
camavermic::Poor Magic. Without D12, I don't think that team could beat Cleveland State.
rockndoc2::I didnt see the game tonight.  Just looking at the stats, it looks like the only difference in this game was the 8 blocked shots by D12.  If just half of them go in , its a tie game.
bjonthe492nd::its because kyrie only plays in the 1st and 4th quarter and those are the quarters they dominate...coach scott should see the corrolation...trade sessions.
taa2008::Easy there, King.  Cleveland is still technically rebuilding and Orlando is Jekyll-and-Hyde this year.  Whenever they have their act together they are a top team in the East.  Whenever they do not they are a bottom-feeder, and are still 14-9.  Plus it was in Orlando.  While I would have liked to see a more consistent effort by the Cavs, I think it would have been a bit much to expect them to win this game.
KingGeorge53::CAvs again lost it in the 2nd and 3rd Q thinking they only have to pour it on in the 4th q.    Simply not good enough to do that at this point even against a sinking ship like Orlando.
camavermic::WTF?????????
hulKKNUPE::If I just won half of the scratch-off lotto tickets I've ever played I'd be a millionaire.
rosstheboss42::look at that the magic finally pulled out a win
ElArtman1973::2 in a row  finally?

mjedwards95::Why is a guy named 49er Proud Fan 1980 commenting on literally everybody's comments?
scottiepippenicecream::I SWEAR DWIGHT HOWARD WOULD HAVE DEMANDED A TRADE RIGHT AWAY IF THEY LOST THIS GAME. -)
i liked this comment::wow, almost broke 1,000 comments........that has to be a record on espn!
rag63top::NBA_refs_are_weak = left the room to cry into his mom's shoulder for getting picked on
49erProudFan1980::replace shoulder with boosom and its the start of a very disturbing porn
GoredBy21::Just think this is gonna be a close game next year once Dwight leaves this trash team
openminded43::Depends on what they get back for him, they may be better!!!
i liked this comment::it was a close game with dwight there.......
i liked this comment::the browns are on a 5-year plan, but i think they will be in the superbowl next year........
rag63top::I think you are joking right now.  I like Cinci's chances in the next few years to come.  They are really getting a team together.
49erProudFan1980::with RG3
49erProudFan1980::49er wants a freaking WR that can hold onto the ball and not disappear(williams and crabtree)
openminded43::49er wants a TE!!!
rag63top::NBA_refs_are_weak = only watches sports to learn new moves from the cheerleaders.
49erProudFan1980::i like when they heave their chests upwards
rag63top::NBA_refs_are_weak likes to heave his chest upwards to boys, he just learned that one the other night.
MagicBoltzRays::Earl Clark looks really nervous on TV.
Jesse_is_back::Who cares?
MagicBoltzRays::you do since you decided to comment
rag63top::NBA_refs_are_weak = brushes his grandma's hair for fun on a saturday night.
NBA_refs_are_weak::I feed off your rage
NBABaLLers_LuKe::another cavs comeback that falls short, arggg!!! it gets annoying, we need to play good bball for all 4 quarters, not just the 4th!!!
NBABaLLers_LuKe::thats true openminded43, but tonight we had nothing else to do with orlando hitting all them 3's...at least sessions was attacking the basket which was good to see. now when is antawn going to get traded, he never plays defense!!!
openminded43::He had fresh legs!!!
NBABaLLers_LuKe::j-rich hit like 3 or 4 three's
NBABaLLers_LuKe::well when they needed a 3, they hit it. overall, it was a pretty ugly game to watch
bradyandjrich::Hedo and J-Rich had great shooting days, though...
openminded43::Actually the Magic stunk tonight shooting the ball!!! I don't think Redick made a single shot!!!
openminded43::You can't start the game hacking people, stopping the clock and hope they miss FT's...... won't have any players left!!!
NBABaLLers_LuKe::i would rather not talk about lebron :(
GoredBy21::If LeBron said he wanted to go back to Cleveland.. They would take him back in a second.
NBABaLLers_LuKe::lol.....i would rather not take lebron back, it would be so awkward.....
49erProudFan1980::is lebron like that amazing gf who treated you like crap but would take her back in a 2nd because she was just flat out fantastic in the sack?
49erProudFan1980::hmmmm ironic.  if you had lebron, you could have him for the first 3 quarters and than sit him in the 4th.....
MagicBoltzRays::Three Stars 1. Howard 2. Hedo 3. Wafer (just for that awesome Dunk) HM: J-rich and Ryno
bradyandjrich::J-Rich was beast tonight.
Jesse_is_back::1. Nelson injured
openminded43::I like what I saw from "ISH", once he gets integrated, he will upgrade the PG position for the Magic!!!
MagicBoltzRays::from horrid to just bad?
TheCronoMasterMind::He is fast, let's just hope they can teach him the playbook. If this is what we get from the D-league, I say maybe go there more often :D
Jesse_is_back::Was on the Warriors earlier this season
openminded43::YUP!!!

NBA_refs_are_weak::honestly the last time I wrote about bacon she drooled all over the bed and it was kinda gross, so I stay away from the fatty foods
NBA_refs_are_weak::I write about whatever gets your mother into the sack
Dank Darvish::She likes my $@%!$ too.
rag63top::My mom loves the bacon
49erProudFan1980::bacon?
i liked this comment::i noticed the feds took down first row again but u can still get the .eu version......
Carslon12::yup they arrested him
Jesse_is_back::Fright coward #12
hulKKNUPE::41 points in the 4th??? Smooth Orlando. Real smooth.
bradyandjrich::At least the offense is clicking again...that's good to see.
TheCronoMasterMind::They still won, didn't they?
i liked this comment::so orlando fans isn't it awkward cheering for dwight knowing that he would rather be somewhere else???????
hulKKNUPE::Sounds stupid if you are a Cavs fan. How did that Lebron situation turn out?
i liked this comment::lebron annoys me, so i didn't mind him leaving, at least he took maverick carter with him......what a genius
bradyandjrich::It's not set just yet...you never know. He likes it in Orlando.
openminded43::Some people just don't know how good they have it!!!
49erProudFan1980::it's like having sex with your gf when she's thinking of another man.  who cares, enjoy it while it lasts
hyperk1d::That is probably one of the best analogies I've heard so far.
MagicBoltzRays::attendance is down by about 4500 in cleveland this year. what happened other than LeBron leaving?
HDTVOHIO::the hatred of LeBron/support of a LeBronless cavs faded
rag63top::Breaking News:  CBJ trade Rick Nash for Dwight Howard
NBA_refs_are_weak::Nice story bro......... Nah I didn't read it, and neither will anyone else.  We don't Care.
redlobster57::who wants to drop the soap
bradyandjrich::D12 will stay in Orlando!
TheCronoMasterMind::Always hate when the Magic get a huge lead, they ALWAYS let the other team back in. It's quite frustrating sometimes. The Magic are on a streak, thanks to beating 2 struggling teams, but it doesn't matter, at least they are out of the single point quarters. Good game Magic. Hopefully they can keep Howard and Anderson with the Magic, but who knows. D12 will probably be leaving sadly, he's the most popular player here in Orlando. Either way, here's hoping that their mini-win streak continues tomorrow!
jonty_1981::Well we all know that no nba team will win a ring with Howard  in line up. Any close game will result with him going to free throw line and well we all know how good he is from there
Chris31708::He had Phil Jackson as the coach.
HDTVOHIO::Shaq won numerous titles...they just gotta get somebody who can rebound and shoot free throws on that champ team so howard can lay off the glass at the end of close games.
Poopon Astick 00::good game both teams. best of luck
MagicBoltzRays::I believe that's either 109 or 110 consecutive sellouts.
redlobster57::who's comeing to my house free beer
HDTVOHIO::do you live at a red lobster? Do we get free cheddar biscuits too?
redlobster57::maybe depends
davem20us::MMMM Cheddar Biscuits....
49erProudFan1980::those are delicious sober...i wonder how amazing they would be drunk
rag63top::Free beer and bu,tt sex
clevelandcavaliers014::HHHHAAAAAAHHHHHAAAAAAA!!!!!!
49erProudFan1980::the last part could be good.....depending
49erProudFan1980::where?
NBA_refs_are_weak::big reason why I like a guy like howard, and I cant stand Melo, was if you watched melo last year on denver, you could tell he was leaving. we all saw that a mile away. but it was the way he would act and treat his teammates. like he didnt give a $@%!. its the nature of the sport and a free agent, its your choice as to where you play. but dont then turn around and treat guys youve played with for years like garbage cause you're looking at NY and now these are just guys you have to play with. you can tell howard is still enjoying himself and is still being a teammate to the guys in orlando. Him calling them out for their play the other day had nothing to do with free agency, that was about just competeting. I honestly believe him when hes all in every night for himself and his team
hyperk1d::Melo didn't play anywhere near as hard.
NBA_refs_are_weak::thank goodness a virgin troll named rag63top's opinion is about as important to me as what comes out of Sarah Palin's mouth.
rag63top::BLAAAAAAAA..... LAME
HDTVOHIO::yeah but Carmelo probably understood why his teammates might not be playing hard. Dwight Howard keeps questioning why his teammates aren't playing well...Dwight is aloof to the situation which might be just as bad as carmelo.
rag63top::Nice story bro......... Nah I didn't read it, and neither will anyone else.  We don't Care.
NBA_refs_are_weak::oh, is that why you commented on me talking about howard calling out his teammates when it was towards the end? LOL, caught
HDTVOHIO::I agree...posted on it after reading the first half line only
hyperk1d::He plays hard every night.
Jesse_is_back::When they trade Dwight Howard please send Nelson with him!
NBA_refs_are_weak::lol tbh, I think Howard is just about done playing with Nelson. hes spent his tenure with the Magic waiting for him to take the next step and he just never has
hyperk1d::None of your posts make any basketball sense.
HDTVOHIO::I didn't watch the game...I know that Kyrie was scared of Dwight's blocks...and I know he got blocked at the end there, but were most of howard's 8 blocks on kyrie?
Jesse_is_back::Yeah
yata9arasu::I think it was about 2, maybe 3 blocks.
HDTVOHIO::ouch
rag63top::Come on lottery pick Cavs.
clevelandcavaliers014::Can't win if you don't play.
i liked this comment::now the magic can feel good about themselves they beat the mighty cavs...........
i liked this comment::i predicted the cavs to win by 50, i am a very optimistic fan
HDTVOHIO::i don't think the comments work against each other...he thought they'd lose cuz they suck, and even though they one he still thinks they suck.
hyperk1d::Weren't you in here earlier going off about how they suck and they were gonna lose?
i liked this comment::who me?
Nirvana_Fan91::Nice to be streaking in the win column again.
hyperk1d::Against the Wizards and Cavs. We'll see if they've fixed their mentality when someone punches them in the mouth.
redlobster57::cavs need a player quick
Nirvana_Fan91::That'll do it.
rag63top::Well I guess losing by 8 is better then losing by 28.  At least for moral purposes alone.
Jesse_is_back::Why does Cleveland smell like tuna??
clevelandcavaliers014::A joke man.
clevelandcavaliers014::Bend over and I'll show ya. LOL
49erProudFan1980::==================)   8=
hyperk1d::Why do your jokes suck?
49erProudFan1980::close your legs
