hackmanjones2013::play andrew nicholson more, ya morons!
AndrewNicholson44::once harrington comes back he won't get any playing time. they need to trade one or two power forwards
Sam58548::Orlando should finally realize they should have taken the Brooklyn offer. When your whole trade is hoping that Harkless turns into a stud...you know youre in trouble.
trizzo23::magic got 5 first if you count harkless 15th this year..vuc 16th last year plus 3 first and 2-2nd..and afflalo a 20 point scorer at 7 mill instead of max..and magic pick this year should be a top five pick were with lopez might fall to 15-20 ....no brainer magic did take best deal.....oooo and no bad foot
hackmanjones2013::yeah brooke lopez is not bad at all
Sam58548::20 pt/gm scorer...and 4 first round picks to go with him. How does the Magic pass that up? Seriously...
Pusha Tonn::I think Lowry is a great player but Calderon is really underrated:  Lowry as a starter: 4 games, 18 pts, 6.3 assists, 5.8 rebs. 54%fg shooting, 44% 3pt shooting. Calderon as a starter: 6 games, 13 pts, 12 assists, 3.1 rebs. 45.1% fg shooting, 57.6% 3pt shooting.
LoveBall04::overpaid is different than overrated.  GM overpaid, a bunch of other people believe he couldn't be the backup on most teams.
trizzo23::how is someone making 10 mil under-rated?
EL_ABALLARDE::So Raptors wasted their money with Lowry, and Calderon is playing his best season....
LoveBall04::This isn't the best Calderon has played...quite normal for him actually.
toronto-vigilante3::Calderone knows his job's on the line...
EL_ABALLARDE::I know Lowry is a beast, but is the irony of business......now Calderon is balling like a boss.....
wnsj89::except they didn't, Lowry is a beast
toronto-vigilante3::ARRRRRRRRRRRRRGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
wnsj89::wooo, Argos hosting the 100th Grey Cup baby!!!!!!
Noles506::#argos #greycup
taco bell surprise::aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooossssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!
chris johnson 558::jj redick is waaaaaaaay better than afflalo and more clutch player
Colin__444::way to go raps!
RAPSATTACK::I still think BC does a huge trade this year whether it is for a SF like Deng or Granger or as a third team that acquires Pau Gasol in the Josh Smith trade  Anything to save his own a$$ from getting fired I think he will do
.antistratfordian.::Yes way, Jose!   The White Rondo Strikes Back!
toronto-vigilante3::Don't be fooled Raps fans...this was more a game of how BAD Orlando played......We don't have enough pieces to even play .450 ball in this league unless everyone steps up their game EVERY game for a full FOUR quarters.
toronto-vigilante3::Tell me when the 8th seed in the East reaches .500 and then we can talk  _______________________________  The 8th seed will be .500 throughout the season...and this team can't hang with anyone on a regular basis.  We're half a team away from getting better.
RAPSATTACK::Tell me when the 8th seed in the East reaches .500 and then we can talk   As it looks now we have a chance  our biggest two competitors are  talking about trading their star players
Leafsfankenny67::Finally able to celebrate à Raptors win again!
Raptorsfan080::lets hope we go 2-1 on this road trip, and that should be when Lowry comes back
RAPSATTACK::does anyone agree when Stat come back the Knicks will suck once again
Leafsfankenny67::Raptors!!!! With the exception of yesterdays loss to Boston this has been à Good week to be à Toronto sports fan
nietoadrian::calderon 18 asist, the most underrated pg
Raptorsfan080::agreed
RAPSATTACK::he is good
KNICKS2013NBACHAMPS::TOO BAD  THESE TEAMS WANT  MAKE THE  PLAY0OFFS
toronto-vigilante3::What....?
RAPSATTACK::who is in the east contending for the 8th? Bucks and Hawks?  LA probably gets Smith for nothing MIL prob trades Jennings cuz they can't pay him  Who is left?
RAPSATTACK::Raptors might  Weak East
KNICKS2013NBACHAMPS::KEEP  BOTH
jays hit moonshots::ARRRRRRRGOOOOOSSS
feeldabern::raptors up ten shooting w 14 secs left on clock. f in mutts
toleop::yes, indeed :)
jays hit moonshots::shooting for pizza
toleop::was it a 3pt shot?
toronto-vigilante3::I was saying the same thing...
hokienation135::Why do the Raptors have both Lowry and Calderon? Trade Calderon to the Bulls
LoveBall04::Calderon will be gone by trade deadline.  I'm glad he's playing good right now.  He'll get us a bit more, but not a whole lot.
jw95275::Recent games suggest Calderon is a better leader, and more wins. Lowry just goes for individual numbers.
KNICKS2013NBACHAMPS::TAJ GIBSON
RAPSATTACK::Lowry is injury-prone    and what will we get from the Bulls? Deng?
feeldabern::explain to me why if you up 10 its why you wouldn't turn the clock down? why? bc u r a n a hole
MagicBoltzRays::you know you suck when you can't score 90 against the raptors.
LA..96::Good to see Nik Vucevic getting some playing time
hokienation135::<b> Calderon needs to be traded for some value. Raptors already have lowry</b>
Fraka9::calderon &gt; Lowry
KNICKS2013NBACHAMPS::TRUE      BUT FOR WHO
TheCronoMasterMind::Raptors played last night, and we're looking like the ones with tired legs. Hate to see what we'll look like against the Hawks tomorrow.
KNICKS2013NBACHAMPS::WHERES  LANDRY  FIELDS  @  LMAOOO
KNICKS2013NBACHAMPS::DAMN   HE  NEEDS  LIN LOL
RAPSATTACK::he is injured
Magic are better than you::And thats game.  Good game raptors
Raptorsfan080::GOOO RAPTORS GOOOOO! wohoooo
TheCronoMasterMind::"Nelson missed the three" There's something I'm used to hearing right now.
toronto-vigilante3::Milk the clock, guys.......take your time.
toronto-vigilante3::What a bunch of losers sitting in the court side seats....Derozen with the slam, and they're not even standing up or excited....???
MagicBoltzRays::pathetic 4th quarter.
LesGeaux225::Man, this board is full of people dissing their own teams. This game is truly the Shabazz Bowl. Trust me, as a Hornets fan, I can definitely relate.
RAPSATTACK::except the Raptors pick goes to OKC
Magic are better than you::Not dissing so much as accepting reality
RAPSATTACK::I still have hope for the Raptors but this game doesn't help it   We still can get the 8th seed in the weak east
toronto-vigilante3::Exactly.
TheCronoMasterMind::This is around the time Redick would usually take over the game :/
RAPSATTACK::again if the raptors had lowry we will be up double digits especially since Nelson is playing like garbage
RAPSATTACK::god its so tough to be a Raptor fan this year not good enough for the eighth seed obviously and can't root for a tank cuz OKC gets our pick....
MagicBoltzRays::now the Magic are doing the choking
TheCronoMasterMind::Gotta love that Big Baby defense: Stand there until after the shot is being made, then pretend like you were trying to block it after its in the air.
toronto-vigilante3::Well since this is a 1 - 3 team on the road....Raps have a 50 - 50 chance of winning this game...
TheCronoMasterMind::Here's an idea Davis: Instead of holding onto the ball for 15 seconds of the shot clock and throwing up a prayer, how about PASS the ball?
TheCronoMasterMind::Guess Davis is our fat version of Kobe :/
MSU SPARTAN PRIDE -- AWWWWW SHUCKY DUCKY NOW::Wow, I didn't think anyone wanted to watch two AAU teams battle it out.
RAPSATTACK::please leave hater
MagicBoltzRays::Raptors have some tired legs maybe.
Magic are better than you::That didnt look tired
Magic are better than you::lol!
MagicBoltzRays::meh. well, they are missing a lot of jumpshots.
MagicBoltzRays::our bench is god awful.
Magic are better than you::Wow that was awful
AboutDatLife::Kyle Lowry's the most underrated PG in the league. He was a baller in H-town. Sad to see him leave. He's tough as nails, will scrap for boards with 6'9'' PFs, can score from anywhere on the floor, and is a great facilitator, especially on fast breaks.
Sportsfan61679::Lowry &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lin
AboutDatLife::Hands down. It's not even close... and that's coming from a diehard Houston fan.
TheCronoMasterMind::Raptors scored 32 in the first quarter, and only 35 since.
toronto-vigilante3::...you sound surprised....?
Sportsfan61679::magic were just toying with them I guess
MagicBoltzRays::Raps made their first four threes, and missed their last seven.
Magic are better than you::She is a dangerous mistress, once you get a few you just start chucking em up
Sportsfan61679::I respect this magic team.  Lots of heart, even though they lost their superstar and injured players
TheCronoMasterMind::Best FT % we've had for the entire Magic team since before we got Howard.
Fraka9::Montenegro!!!
Qster15::cRaptors...LOL what a joke of a team. Up double digits and they kept going at the 3ball.  Magic win.. cRaps always fail in the forth
RAPSATTACK::God i hate the nickname please don't use it
