ksjameson::So, let's see, the Wolves lead the league in giving away wins when leading going into the fourth quarter with ten: If they could even win half of those games, they would be 25-28, putting them in 10th place behind the Lakers. And if they won all of them, they'd be 30-23 and hold the 7th seed. Sigh ...
luvnbayes::I can't believe how disappointing AK-47 has been this year.  I bet his PER in the last 5 minutes of close games is among the worst in the league.  Nice 3 point shot, Andrei.  Only missed it by about six feet.  And way to fight for that rebound off the missed FT.  He is one NERVOUS athlete in close games, and should never be allowed to touch the ball in crunch time.
nba is the worst::Home records of the winning teams the Lakers have beat on the road this season:  Warriors 18-7 Nets 20-12  Denver is 23-3 at home...
Ellis_Curry::how are you a fan of the lakers AND the celtics.... (i know this is completely irrelevant)
jeff050578::Dubs have four more road games.@Indy, @ NY, @Boston @Philly. After that they play 22 of their last 26 games at home. If they can win 2 of the 4 remaining road games they will be in great shape to start their home stand. GO DUBS!!
WatfordFTW012::Ricky Rubio is one of the most underrated Point Guard's. His shooting can improve, but he acts like a real point guard, being able to dish out assists to the mediocre players.
danyoyoh::Mark Jackson is a GREAT coach. He's makin' Jarret Jack look like an all-pro. Curry and Thompson are better than ever. Dude clearly knows how to coach guards.
tysonwynn26::there is no shooting guard in the roster!
ZonaWildcats_2170::sadly we lost, however. I may say D. Will played pretty well (:
jeff050578::DWill did play pretty well. As a GS fan I am lucky because David Lee puts up that type of game almost every night.
htabbach::Williams is on his way to do this on a regular bases as well but the issue with MN is Shved, he is a poor player as of late!
BeastFromTheEast23::UofA! UofA! UofA!
junoNCAL::aye babe wanna join the winning side and maybe grab a drank or sometin?
Kev_010::wolves wasted money on Roy. They had a way better team last year. No one on their team wants to score. Rubio has the ball in his hands most of the time and he himself can't score. Most of them can't even finish their layups. Kahn doesn't even know what the word "trade" means. This team is going to go nowhere.
karan0421::gs fan but rubio is my favorite player in the nba
danyoyoh::Yeah Rubio's the man. Only his 2nd year and he's gonna get much better at shooting. Still, to put up double digit PTS and AST, and get close to double digits in REB and STL I mean damn!  He really wasn't that far away from a quadruple-double
convolutedthought::overrated
relentlessind127::This TImberwolves team is going to be scary if D-Will keeps getting better with playing time.  If we can have Pek, Love, D-Will-AK47, Shved-Budinger, Rubio-Ridnour next year that is a young solid group.  Plus a lottery pick from the draft this year. Just be patient wolves fans our time will come. Headed the right direction, just injuries this year, Could be a blessing for D-Will by mid march though maybe get off Adelmans $@%! list
Louis the III::i think moving ridnour or AK would be smart to maybe get younger and more athletic, or improve our spot in the draft.  It's not an incredibly deep draft  but there's some talented 2 guards out there.
Iceman21990::missed the game, but wow rubio's stat stuffing. Typical wolves game, start out fiery can't hold lead, can't finish with no go-to player.
dreamhax::he flopped to get most of his points.
CrabtreeWasHeld::GOOD W...throw your dubs up
DrBullpen::Landry &gt; Bogut
HH69::Damn, I missed the game...  Congrats Warriors!
Oaktown1029::Good win for the Warriors. Seems players like Landry and Lee are playing better without Bogut in there.
convolutedthought::Ive been saying that Warriors losing Bogut was a blessing since everyone has to rebound
korn7860::Warriors ride Jack late, surge past Wolves   Since when has winning by 1 point been a surge?
SFWildcard::obviously you have comprehension problem, surging doesnt only mean blow out, it can also mean rallying from a huge deficit
Brickyyy Rubio::bricky for 3!!! brickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
bstanto_08::o man twolves are tough to watch as usual...we need to trade rubio while hes worth something right now...twolves need full overhaul and rebuild
MinniWolves90::Lets actually try to go forward with what we have for once.
Louis the III::nope
MinniWolves90::Been there, done that.
MY WOLVES EQUAL NO TALENT::I doubt we win another game this season.
BayAreaFan40::going to the next game's board. see u guys there
junoNCAL::Ellis_Curry good. i'm still bitter over the fisher flop on monta that cost us a playoff birth  amen bro, amen
KingLebriansKarateKid::i dont f with no snitches so dont tell me who tellin
gooseydan::The score says it all.....Timberpuppies tank again. They SUCK!
dc100::Warriors play better without Bogut.
ImAWitness06::I hope the fans who booed the owners last year feel extremely foolish right now
CrabtreeWasHeld::you deserve to get boooed when you use the amnesty on a 4 mill expiring contract when Andris Biedrins is on your roster getting paid 30+ mill over the next 3 years
smbeaty::is that the same owner that OK'd amnestying charlie bell instead of Biedrins or Jefferson? which resulted in such limited cap space that when the rockets wanted to unload harden for klay thompson straight up....the W's couldn't? is that the same owner whose jock your sniffin?
alexsilva46::charlie bell showed up to his court case drunk that involved him being drunk....id rather have those two on the team than someone that cant understand the picture and that has not been heard of him since hes been released
CrabtreeWasHeld::agree on the amnesty + biedrins..they would not have been able to amnesty jefferson because he was acquired via trade and not eligible to be amnestied
SB4LlFE::the owner didn't care and he expected it
seaverkyaw::He should've thought a little better before that. It wasn't his place to speak during that ceremony and he should have realized that he had just made an unpopular (though a trade I agreed with) trade. He wanted to talk and he got what he deserved for wanting to be in the limelight.
BayAreaFan40::he cared. he said he stayed up all night replying to hate mail. I, for one, wouldn't have booed him if i was there.
KingLebriansKarateKid::tough game, anyone wanna meet me down at sneaky pete's and pound some 18 year olds?
KingLebriansKarateKid::LOL SWEATIN CUHH
SFWildcard::I didnt realize that the Ws are 8 wins away from being a 500 team in years
BayAreaFan40::i bet my cousin at the beginning of the season $20 warriors would finish at least.500
SteelerCeltic::Jarret Jack is coming up huge for GS
Ellis_Curry::we have to resign him even if it means going over the luxury tax line
sfbenjii::20 mil for Jefferson, were they high when they acquired him?
AmnestyBiedrens::Amnesty Biedrens
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Speaking of tanking Im surprised Jazz fans still arent going at us this very moment with a slew of neverending tank comments
AmnestyBiedrens::i dont understand y anyone would hate on the warriors. we haven't had that much success the past few yrs. we didn't get good by building a "super team" so there's no reason to hate.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::exactly, 1 successful season in almost 2 decades
Ellis_Curry::i actually think besides the occasional troll/hater every team has great fans other than the lakers
LightsGoDownIntheCity::and Miami
Mittens___the cat::warriors fans are the biggest scum on planet earth that's why they have a problem with everyone.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::were all being civil here except for you
AmnestyBiedrens::they probably moved on to the clippers board since the jazz just got killed by them
Minnysota Vikings::I'm surprised you guys have problems with Jazz fans. They were extremely nice when the Wolves played them a couple nights ago.
seaverkyaw::Yes, but your franchise didn't steal a top 10 draft pick away from them.
SFWildcard::they have this personal anger with the Warriors because the Ws got the lottery last year
LightsGoDownIntheCity::I actually got along with them quite well and found them to be funny
GoldenState925.::I'm out, people.  BRING ON INDIANA!!
AmnestyBiedrens::and the knicks!
Ellis_Curry::they got some tough wings we gotta show up defensively
AmnestyBiedrens::can't wait for the playoffs. i better get my tickets earler this time. last time i payed like $125 for nose bleeds but it was worth it
WalleyeOfTheTiger::Almost pulled it out.  Wolves have to keep losing so we can get a decent lottery position and hopefully compete next year.
alexsilva46::its not like the athletes are tanking its just the management held out players to initiate the tank...the players we replaced them with still gave it their all
SFWildcard::Even playoff teams sometimes tank to get a good position
Ellis_Curry::i'm confused, every team has fans like this, but for some reason ppl seem to only give us sh.it about tanking
WalleyeOfTheTiger::You could argue the team should tank, but I think you lose respectability as an athlete if you are not giving it your best every night.
Ellis_Curry::WalleyeOfTheTiger - I would give a team $@%! for tanking intentionally, but there is nothing wrong with smart fans wanting their team to lose to be in a better position for the future.  i agree with the second half of what you said, but if it's what the fans want isn't it what the team should do....
AmnestyBiedrens::yea teams tank all the time
WalleyeOfTheTiger::I would give a team $@%! for tanking intentionally, but there is nothing wrong with smart fans wanting their team to lose to be in a better position for the future.
GoldenState925.::Warriors have been there.  Don't sweat it.  I know it sucks, though.
GoldenState925.::Now, is it just me, or do these Wolves fans sound just so goddam depressed.  Maybe it's because they have to live in Minnesota and we live in California.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me, though.
WalleyeOfTheTiger::Being a life-long Minnesota sports fan is one of the leading causes of depression.  Fortunately, I have plenty of memories from 1987 and 1991 to get me through the down decades.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::theyre quite angry
roolthecool7499::as a laker fan, this win hurts us
Ellis_Curry::good. i'm still bitter over the fisher flop on monta that cost us a playoff birth
LightsGoDownIntheCity::correct
Louis the III::I told y'all last years team was better
Mittens___the cat::I'm beginning to think that your not even a Wolves fan, just some troll that like to spend his time trolling the wolves fan base.
Mittens___the cat::what are you talking about. Last years team was awful, once rubio went down they lost almost every game, plus this years team was above .500 when they had a good 3pt shooter in chase, all this team needs is 3pt shooting that's it.
Louis the III::why because I'm not afraid to knock the team? What quality wins do the wolves have this year?  Last years team actually beat good teams with or without rubio and klove
GoldenState925.::Which was better?  1.  The Baron Davis dunk over Andrei Kirilenko.  Video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w_1ZEk4mds  2.  The Harrison Barnes dunk over Nikola Pekovic.  Video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2WD-exDgdU
FriscoWarriors415::I was at the B. Davis dunk play off game and that was the craziest I have seen oracle arena rock. I have to go with that dunk because it was the playoffs and the atmosphere was just estatic.
jeff050578::Both dunks are insane. I gotta go with Barons by a slim margin
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Gotta go with BD's, the atmosphere there was absolutely insane
SFWildcard::where can you buy the posters?
Ellis_Curry::first of all SFWildcard could be a girl, and second of all who cares if hes gay
SFWildcard::dont worry Ill buy you a poster with a butt hurt on it
LightsGoDownIntheCity::you wolves fans are confusing
Mittens___the cat::you want to buy posters of grown men. Phaggy alert!!!
AmnestyBiedrens::i was at the game for the baron dunk. i liked the barnes dunk more but given that the baron dunk was during a bigger game i gotta say b-diddys
Ellis_Curry::i gotta go with barnes cuz i was at that game but baron's dunk was in the playoffs so it's very close
GoldenState925.::True.  I have to go with Baron's, though!!
kwheels22::I guarantee Rubio shoots at least 36% the rest of the year and finishes well over 35% shooting  Next year he'll be shooting at 40% clip 15ppg 10apg 5rpg 2.5spg
jeff050578::I think Minnesota actually has a bright future if they keep the right core. Not sure what the right core is and if K Love is part of it but there are some good young players on the team either way. I just dont know about the injuries. It seems like you are cursed
kwheels22::last year he was lucky if he ever made a layup or a pull up jumper.  This year he barely misses jumpers if he doesn't make it and he actually knows how to lay the ball up now.
SFWildcard::If he starts shooting well his assists will go down
kwheels22::he wont shoot well, just average.  he'll still get 10 apg because he makes great plays.  Having Love, AK47, an improved Dwill and Pekovic shooting the ball will up his assists.
jeff050578::Jack has taken over Crawford for 6th man already.
GoldenState925.::Good game Wolves fans.  Jarrett Jack just took off where he left from Friday's win over San Antonio!!
famousfoot1000::how different would this game have been if jack would have been thrown out like he should have been
j2the4thpow3r::The replay doesnt even show what happened. Only showing Jack's reaction. Kinda wack.
famousfoot1000::what happen was he walked over and forearmed someone in the chest
j2the4thpow3r::The replay doesnt even show what happened. Only showing Jack's reaction. Kinda wack.
Ellis_Curry::an equivalent statement would be how different would this game have been if rubio's flops werent called in the wolves' favor every time
Ellis_Curry::i agree pekovic was getting hit, but we are talking about rubio's flopping which is undeniable and the refs missed on that too
famousfoot1000::Flops? dont know what game you were watching, wouldnt say anything about the refs since pek was hacked on 80% of the time he was on the court
j2the4thpow3r::The replay doesnt even show what happened. Only showing Jack's reaction. Kinda wack.
GoldenState925.::Someone didn't get their nap   :)
LightsGoDownIntheCity::ugh
famousfoot1000::man we miss Chase, and Reddick would have looked great on this team
Bernie Fine Loves K-State Fans::warrior fans deserve leukemia for hating on the wolves so much.
jeff050578::I appreciate the wolves. They improved our record 3-0 this year and 18-5 in the last 23 times the two have played
Bernie Fine Loves K-State Fans::I hate my life right now.
Ellis_Curry::really.... nobody deserves that even people who wish it on others dont deserve that
LightsGoDownIntheCity::those were trolls man, every team has them
SFWildcard::those trolls are not even that bad to deserve leukemia, this dude is just an idiot
j2the4thpow3r::I love the Wolves! Thanks for the win!
MNfreakTim::The wolves just need that guy off the bench or at the SG spot to take those end of game shots or big shots during the game. Once we have that you will see quite a change in the team. Its just too bad there have been so many injuries this year.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Biedrins and Barnes a combined -23 today, ouch
j2the4thpow3r::Its crazy that the Dubs used it on Bell. Just disappointing.
j2the4thpow3r::And keep Jack... That is if he is willing to come off the bench. He may have some takers next year.
j2the4thpow3r::How can you use the amnesty clause every year? Why not just apply it to Biedrins? Dubs have enough height now to remove him.
SFWildcard::speaking of nice thought, Tyson Chandler almost signed with the Ws , JJHickson was about to sign with the Ws last year
jeff050578::its a nice thought though
SFWildcard::you can only use the amnesty once and they used it already
jeff050578::Plus with the money they save with his contract they could pick up a servicible big man for half the money
jeff050578::Cant wait till Biedrins contract is off the books. Jeffersons too
SFWildcard::he needs a Baron davis type of point guard to excel
jeff050578::If we didnt have to pay for Biedrins next year we would be able to keep Jack
jeff050578::Doubt we will ever see that guy again.
SFWildcard::that 19 mil can go to a Rudy Gay type of player
LightsGoDownIntheCity::give me '08-'09 Biedrins and Im a happy man
SFWildcard::If we can manage to get  2-2 for the the next 4 road games , I will be happy
jeff050578::@Indy will be tough but I can see them winning 2 of 3 from Knicks, Celts and Sixers
jeff050578::He came back their last game
junoNCAL::yeah Granger's back
SFWildcard::Is Granger playing already
jeff050578::Agreed. I see them as the only team capable of upsetting Miami in the East
SFWildcard::The Pacers are well coached and one of the most balanced team in the league
Cappiethedog::When Jack and Curry are in the game, who plays the point?
alexsilva46::Cappiethedog Jack does
Cappiethedog::Why the sarcasm? I'm not trolling your team. The Warriors aren't on TV that often.
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Biedrins
HK-47.1::Serious? Jack does.
MikeBreenGetGreen::Warriors still with a big home stretch - one to watch
LightsGoDownIntheCity::yup, soft schedule to end the year, Id prefer to sit in 6th over the 5 seed though
LightsGoDownIntheCity::Dont forget the Nuggets
jeff050578::Memphis has 17 goad games left this season and play some tough teams at home. With Warriors at home at end of year so much it is possible they can pass Memphis
SFWildcard::You are right we are better off with the Spurs but they are not chokers, they are just going to be tired at that time
LightsGoDownIntheCity::I figured Memphis would lay down and give it up after losing Gay but theyre rolling right now albeit not against the toughest of competition
junoNCAL::we shouldn't underestimate the clips too much.  if we get the 4th seed and the grizzlies at home, we can easily win. also we'll be avoiding the thunder in the 2nd round (i think the spurs are chokers)
SFWildcard::I understand your love for the Clips but I still want that 4th seed
SFWildcard::after this 5 game road trip , 22 of 26 are at home,  I like their chances
jeff050578::Minnesota could probably make the playoffs if they were in the Eastern Conference
LightsGoDownIntheCity::I dont know if I can say the Warriors have turned the ship around but theyre winning close games which critical to any playoff bound team. 15-6 in games decided by 3pts or less with 90secs or less to play.
