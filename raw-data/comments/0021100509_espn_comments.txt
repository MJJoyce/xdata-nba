k08324::Kornets = why everyone hates NJ
drftw42134::You act like as if there isn't fans like that around the NBA. Some fans take it more serious than others. Your team has fans which is why people hate Dallas as well so I wouldn't be talking if I were you
Alan Hardt::Haywood's a D-league player at best and Kidd should retire.His 3 ball just isn' good...Mavs need Deron now.
tjtkgk22::Love seeing all these nets fans getting so amped up because they won a game and talking trash bout the mavs.......I would say lets wait til the playoffs to see who does better but obviously the nets wont be there this year or the next...or the next.....or the next
joeman1146::we're only 7 games out.
jrtall3n7::enjoy the defeat
mark35345::The Mavs would have won easily if Lamar played (Ha Ha).
metsrule1296::awe poor maverick fans, probably a little butt hurt? NEts will have D12 and D-will next year while u guys keep old dirk.. HAHA Nets&gt; Mavs!!! BTW Jason kidd as a net&gt; jason kidd as a mav #justsayin
Andrano::Jason Kidd as a mav 1 ring, Jason Kidd as Net 0 rings.ijs
muccmaster::How does a 7 foot tall center only average 4 rebounds per game?
joeman1146::he had 6. and 38 points. and humph had 15.
hernon254::be careful or hasheem thabeet will come looking for you
jrtall3n7::by owning the Mavs
Giggity.iggity::Good to see Lopez have a monster game.  Dude is easily the 2nd best center in the East when healthy.
RCNBA::If Haywood is going to be the 2nd leading scorer then that will not be good for Mavs
NotEvenMad::To Nets fans: Would you give up Brook Lopez along with whatever other decent players that Orlando would probably ask for in return for Dwight Howard?
jrtall3n7::not really, considering Dwight is coming to Brooklyn either way. Would rather acquire him as a free agent. Nets will be able to name their price. some other team may rent him for the season and give ORL some good value in return, but he won't extend with that team and he'll still join the Nets after that as free agent.
jaoyola::No...
netjunkie88::Vince Carter: 2 pts, 2 turnovers. The Odom bug is spreading.
BasketballLegend123::stupid.. shoulda won the game
Twrigs57::38 points and the Nets only win by 1? God, the Nets are terrible.
joeman1146::morrow and d-will combined for 8-30. imagine if they hit half that.
epicbenz NJD::yes because our 11-25 team beat a 21-14 team moron
cymbal2k::Yeah, because thats the first time someone has dropped 35+ points in a close game. man you are an idiot.
CoreyBlair31::http://sportsblogette.blogspot.com/2012/02/kings-royalty-in-sacramento.html  The Kings are the FUTURE of the NBA!!!!!!111
nygiants731::NJ got lucky again imagine that!!!!!!!!!
cymbal2k::As a nets fsn I just hope that Otis doesnt like a lopez for dwight deal, or a bynum for dwight deal and ends up either keeping him or giving him to the warriors, in which case he will bounce at the end of the season. After that all bets are off- Dallas wont be able to afford him AND dwill, unless, as I am sure all of you have read that SI article, EVERYTHING goes perfectly for the mavs this off season. He will def go to brooklyn and you will have the 2 best centers in the league, on top of the best pg in the league, 2 picks from this stacked draft, marshon (who kinda shrunk with lopez in, but hopefully they will learn to work with each other), and one of the tpe 3 pt shooters in the league- and, hopefully, an unbroken promise from a Russian billionare!
cymbal2k::Lopez keeps this type of play going, Nets could do a Lopez for Howard straight up. And I am not saying he will drop 38 every night, but he was a real dominant big man who can score in so many ways. Dwight can score in 1 way. Dwight has significantly better defense, but brook is still a 7 foot body in the paint, which does something on the defensive end, and he is not useless on defense, he is just not great. And also the fact that he had 6 rebounds means nothing, watch the game- he tipped a lot of balls, boxed out a lot so OTHER people get the rebouns bc the opponent has a 7 foot body to go around now- stats never tell the whole story.
CandySparker::38 Special for Brook Lopez
WhyUHatin47::and a ticket to Orlando.
WhyUHatin47::Howard is defintley going to the Nets.
muccmaster::Why would he want to go to this mess of a team.
joeman1146::cuz once he goes they wont be a mess anymore
mike36784::Mavs only play when it matters.  This is why I dislike them.
mark35345::They're playing like the Lakers did last year.
BasketballTensai::I don't understand why Brook Lopez averages so little rebounds?
urbandigsnyc::because he has the white man's rodman to do that in Humphries
KORNETS::If you seriously think Bynum or any other Center not named Howard is better than Lopez u need your head checked!!!  B-LOPEZ = 2nd BEST BIG MAN IN NBA!!!!
fortwintee1::kevin love is a.....nvm
hookemzuniga1022::Actually Kevin Love is good as well... Lopez needs more Rebounds but agree he is good
rthaw44::as long as hump is right nxt to him it works out
crunchcampion::A big man that can't rebound? He might as well be a small forward!
KORNETS::THE NJ NETS ARE THE NEXT BIG THING AND ARE NOW CONTENDERS IN THE EAST, EASY A PLAYOFF RUN IN THEM.  THEY GOT THE MOST TALENTED YOUNG TEAM ARGUABLY IN THE LEAGUE, THEY ARE UP THERE ITS POSSIBLE THE BEST ON PAPER, SEE FOR YOURSELF!!  STARTING 5 IDEAL: PG - DWILL  (BEST PG) SG - AMORROW  (BEST SHOOTER) SF - MBROOKS  (BEST ROOKIE) PF - KHUMP (BEST HUSTLER/REBOUNDER PF) C - BLOPEZ   (2ND BEST CENTER)  INITIAL POSITION BACKUPS (MY IDEAL) PG - JORDAN FARMAR   (GREAT SCORER/SHOOTER/DEFENDER) SG - DESHAWN STEVENSON   (RELENTLESS DEFENDER!!) SF - GERALD GREEN      (YOUNG STUD MONSTER ATHLETICISM AND RBS) PF - SHELDON WILLIAMS/JORDAN WILLIAMS   (EXCELLENT REBOUNDERS/BIG BODYS/JORDAN GOT POTENTIAL AS ROOKIE) C - MEMHET OKUR     (SUPER SCORER OFF BENCH AND VERY GOOD REBOUNDER, QUALITY BACKUP)  SO YEA AND THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE PG - SUNDIATA GAINES, C - JOHAN PETRO OR INJURED STARTER SOPHOMORE SF - DAMION JAMES OR  INJURED BENCH PLAYER SF/PF - SHAWNE WILLIAMS.   THE NETS ARE DEEP AS $@%!$ AND AWESOME AS HEKLL!!!!!!! COMON GUYS ADMIT THE NETS GOT SUPERB TALENT ON PAPER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
k08324::why you yellin jungle man?
je5725::WOW...... With all that talent.....The Mav's never had a chance......It had to be all the FEAR playing a team that is 10-25 must bring..........It was just TOO MUCH ! ! !   LMAO...............
mugupo::Deron need to get real, if his team is heathy could be like a dark horse in the East.  Lopez is not the same level as D12, but his salary is way less than him and net could use that money to get D12 in Free Agent.
je5725::I bet that Nets Owner burned a Gold DVD of this game and already had it delivered to Orlando.. The Baja Oklahoma chumps lose at home to the Nets..LMAO ! ! !
crunchcampion::I hope that the Magic at least Milk the Nets for everything they have Brook Lopez, Marshon brooks and all their draft picks! That way Dwight suffers and realizes that he should have gone to a better team!
drftw42134::That is actually what happened with the Knicks getting Melo. The Nets are smart though and aren't going to do the same
jrtall3n7::not gonna happen
Antsea91::Well there goes the mavs and lakers chances at getting howard.
crunchcampion::Stupid Mavs just killed it for both teams!
crunchcampion::Dumb as.s Mavs you just potentially cost yourself the chance of getting Dwill and Dwight by making Brook Lopez look like Olajuwan out there! We all know Brook is garbage, but come on Mavs!
HoppingMonkey::your honestly saying brook is garbage? at least do some research before you go on an uninformed rant.
crunchcampion::Li.ck my bal.ls!
KORNETS::UR ALL JEALOUS BROOK IS THE 2ND BEST CENTER IN THE NBA AND IF U DONT THINK SO U NEED TO GET UR HEAD CHECKED
CoreyBlair31::The Kings are the FUTURE of the NBA!!!  http://sportsblogette.blogspot.com/2012/02/kings-royalty-in-sacramento.html
KORNETS::NJ
k08324::^ D O U C H E
Birdmann._.::38 points and 6 rebounds and 0 blocks...... worst center in the league
KORNETS::UR THE WORST FAN IN THE LEAGUE, ANY STAT LINE INCLUDING 38PTS ON ALMOST 70% SHOOTING AND SOLID DEFENSE ON HIS FIRST FULL GAME BACK FROM MISSING THE WHOLE SEASON IS REDICULOUS!!! FOR ANY PLAYER EVEN HEALTHY TO SCORE 38 WITH ZERO REBOUNDS HELL ID TAKE IT!!! HUMPHRIES GOT 15 REBOUNDS IDIOT HES OUR REBOUNDER!! IF HE DIDNT GET EM BROOK WOULD!!  LOPEZ IS BY FAR THE 2ND BEST CENTER IN THE NBA!!
chicagoillini9::go wild brook
thebighallbowski2369::Nets should just play on the road the rest of the year. Wins @ Chi, NY and Dallas. 3-13 at home, blown out most of the time.
jrtall3n7::hopefully in Brooklyn the energy will be better from the fans and home games will feel more like home games.
KORNETS::dont forget PHILLY!!!!!!
Slim_Greaser_310::biggest joke of the year=ricky rubio roockie of the year
McCovey521::That is a joke, Kyrie Irving is the rookie of the year.
Stan Van Gundy Rulez::Otis Smith always does trades with the Warriors and Phoenix, so I wont be Surprissed if Steve Nash or Monta Ellis is on the Magic team by March 15   Just wait and see I would be the best GM ever
KORNETS::noah suckssss and lopez owns bynum, u want lopez AND ellis if the trade goes down and the Nets aint trading Lopez AND Brooks/Humphries
LiN-ciTy::ellis to magic lopez to warriors d-12 to nets  other additions
Stan Van Gundy Rulez::as long as the Magic get Ellis and not Lopez/ Noah /Bynum im good with it
anonymous_sports_watcher__::meow
LiN-ciTy::cute kitty
LiN-ciTy::Mavs fans are boring
LiN-ciTy::sick him kitty
I3UTTON::teams that are 11-25 in the eastern conference that haven't ever won an NBA championship are boring
KORNETS::mavs are wayyyyyyy more boring!!!!!! NETS ARE YOUNG AND UP AND COMING!!!! FRONT RUNNING TEAMS HAVE NOTHING TO LOOK FOWARD TO!!! U EXPECT TO WIN SO ALL THAT COULD SURPRISE U IS A LOSS!!! BORING!! TRUST ME I WOULD KNOW AS A NETS FAN IN THE 2000S WHEN EVERY GAME I WOULD MARK AS A WIN BEFORE WE PLAYED AND IT BE BORING CUZ ID GET MAD IF WE LOST CUZ ID NEVER EXPECT TO LOSE.  NETS MAKE ME PUMPED BEATING TEAMS NOBODY THINKS!!!!!
Blackk Dynamite::Picture this starting 5:  D-Will (20 pts 10 assists) B-Lo (20-25 pts 6-7 reb) D-12 (20 pts 15 reb 3 blks) Morrow (45-50% from 3 pt) Brooks (15 pts a game) BD
LiN-ciTy::damn! dallas is dead
I3UTTON::naw i'm holdin down all the Net trolls in here puttin em in their place. I'm having too much fun over here.
I3UTTON::but hey Mav fans aint complaining, we saved cap space by letting go key parts of last seasons roster and STILL going to the playoffs.
LiN-ciTy::you're the only dallas troll in here
LiN-ciTy::u can join me if u like
LiN-ciTy::anyways, im going to troll in the dallas section just like u trollin in here
LiN-ciTy::i cant win with u because u dont get it
I3UTTON::no i totally get it, Nets fans are incapable of being objective and thinking outside the box. that's been made perfectly clear to me
LiN-ciTy::u can find it on....... googlethatshyt.com
I3UTTON::haha way to be specific, contributes nothing to your argument. have fun dreaming tho.
LiN-ciTy::@ 13utton  u dont get it, but the rest do. sorry no 3D for BigD
I3UTTON::way to back up your statement, wheres the article at proclaiming D12 and D-Will going to Jersey? exactly. 12th in the east, nuff said.
LiN-ciTy::lol. i crashed the dallas section. they have nothing to say
I3UTTON::ya other than still having a high off our championship season and anticipating D-Will coming to Dallas next season. 11-25 is boring, sorry not interested.
Blackk Dynamite::Dwight is free to go wherever he wants after the season, and he's already said Brooklyn looks pretty sweet D-Will will stay if D-12 is coming And Lopez can't go anywhere  Put it together...... BD
I3UTTON::nice dream, now lets come back to reality.. 11-25 lol...
Stan Van Gundy Rulez::if Nets want Dwight  - Lopez / Marshon Brooks are not there
mdtuzo::that is if we want to TRADE for him
Blackk Dynamite::The Nets have a good, not great, chance to have D-12, Lopez, and D-Will all at once, for years!  Lopez will become a restricted free agent, and will probably get an offer similar to what DeAndre Jordan got (4 years $40M) for the Nets to match D-Will and D-12 will both be looking at max deals in the $20M a year range.   So $50M on 3 players, annually  Kris Humphries moves on.  Morrow and Brooks are your 2-3.  And you fill in your bench with DeShawn and Co. BD
Stan Van Gundy Rulez::I think no watter what happens with Dwight If he gets traded to the Nets   Lopez to GSW  Brooks Ellis  draft picks to ORL o Orlando  or the Magic trade Ryan Anderson and JJ.Redick for Monta Ellis ...        either way excpect to see Monta on the Magic soon.
I3UTTON::here's an article Nets fans might want to read:  http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/new-jersey-nets/post/_/id/3986/stephen-a-d-will-out-if-nets-dont-land-d-12  Boom.
Blackk Dynamite::That's not exactly news....... BD
I3UTTON::i didn't think it was either but it is to some Nets fans apparently...
Stan Van Gundy Rulez::If the Magic trade Ryan Anderson and pieces to warriors for Monta Ellis does Dwight stay with them
Blackk Dynamite::Dwight will stay in Orlando.......and Danica will win one BD
Blackk Dynamite::The Nets need to find a way to get Lopez, D-Will AND D-12 together! THEN........ BD
Jerryintx88::and on that note im out   nite  all
Jerryintx88::sorry to break your heart but D-will  &amp; D- 12  are coming to dallas..   book it and watch...
Blackk Dynamite::You're reading my mind...... BD
shlomoyaros::cant happen via trade.  only via FA.  see preview link below
I3UTTON::Even the Nets head coach knows the Mavs are a real threat to sign Deron Williams haha. shows how dellusional the fans are
shlomoyaros::recognize that the Nets have so much less talent then the celts and knicks who are the last teams in the playoffs right now.  I can reiterate this enough.  I wrote about it in my Nets 2nd half preview at http://www.talkingnysports.com/2012/02/nets-prospects.html
terpsravensmavs::did you here that through media sources or avery himself? we all know you cant trust either and only santa claus knows (thekola)
I3UTTON::http://espn.go.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/7624424/new-jersey-nets-coach-avery-johnson-mark-cuban-dallas-mavericks-steal-deron-williams  read it and weep ;)
IsaiahFrancis::i was wondering why johnson said this, it doesn't seem like a good strategy i bet he still wishes he was coaching the mavs
feardabeard13::DERRICK WILLIAMS FOR MVP.. OOPS WRONG BOARD
kyle123kfs::LMAO at the Mavs
Michael38061::Yippee-Yi-Yo-Ky-Yaaaa...Yippee-Yi-Yo-Ky-Yaaaaa!
I3UTTON::yeah its funny cause we got a championship banner hanging from the rafters right? LMAO @ Nets fans 11-25
Michael38061::All the cowboys went to sleep
Blackk Dynamite::GREAT GAME by Brooke!  Can you say Increased Trade Value? BD
Michael38061::Howdy pardner
IsaiahFrancis::do you think brook lopez would be better suited as a powerforward?  he doesn't get the rebounds of a center
shooter mcgavin14::well im going to bed, enough bashing of the rednecks for one night. nets made mavs fans cry 2night, and will again when we aquire dwight howard and ruin their plan of a big 3. then they will just be stuck with dirk and a bunch of old has beens. later net fans
terpsravensmavs::really? you only need two hours of bashing for 12 years of losing to us? ok then fairwell  p.s. we love bashing
I3UTTON::wait since when do 11-25 teams earn the right to "bash" the defending champs? haha sorry we can't take your losing ways seriously. that's probably why the Mavs lost to you guys because they couldn't take your weak a$$ team serious. might as well save the energy for a team that's actually good.
Michael38061::Knicks will be no. 1 basketball team in NY next year
