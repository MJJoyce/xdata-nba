missouriviking::When are the Lakers going to be able to turn this around and play like they should!  Also guys I just created a new game. Called MMODodgeball http://www.mmododgeball.com/register.php?referral_id=11 pretty fun game to play. Only have to spend 5 minutes a day yet I still play it for hours
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::Lakersfan1990 remember this bro!   Golden Days &amp; Purple Nights!  We had them before.We are going thru it right now.It is not the end for us.
bwp.bruce::I'm pretty sure LA is set to fall off the map this year and beyond. Kobe made sure of that. Besides, you guys have enough championships. Time for Stern to start regulating some "even distribution".
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::bwp.bruce - That just means you'll be crying yourself to sleep tonight. Well, you better remain in bed all season long because your misery is not gonna disappear anytime soon.  YAAAAAAAWNING......LOL
bwp.bruce::That just means you'll be crying yourself to sleep tonight. Well, you better remain in bed all season long because your misery is not gonna disappear anytime soon.
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZs
lakersfann1990::In dark times, Lakers' Howard continues to keep the light on Home or road, win or lose, the message is always the same from the ever-smiling All-Star center: He remains happy to be here despite his team's epic struggles.
bwp.bruce::Faker fan, I suppose you don't care about your Lakers this year since you are content with your Fakers previous ships. Meanwhile, Kobe still hasn't caught Jordan and you seem to think his 81 points are relevant even though (besides what I pointed out in an earlier post) he scored them in a regular season game against the Raptors who were more of a joke than these year's Lakers. Go away bro.
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::This is the Lakers &amp; Thunder board why don't you go away you TROLL.
lakersfann1990::whats that say to the people who say hes leaving after this season lol
jessica_rabbit17::Robert horry&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kobe FACT!

lakersfann1990::kd doesnt have a ring and has been in the league 5 years
Seven seconds of pleasure::Big difference is KD will be the leader when he wins his first ring, not riding the coattails of a dominant player like Shaq
jessica_rabbit17::Jordan did not win a ring till 7 years in the league 1990 u tosser and he a million times better than ball hog and has more rings so shut up! Durant will have his time for rings kobes is over forever!!

Kobes Black Mamba::Warriors fan actually.
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::Kobes Black Mamba - It's OK, the Lakers only lost by 15.  - Laker fans  Do you mean.Lose*
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::Kobes Black Mamba - No I mean lost, as in past tense, which coincidentally seems to be a common theme among some Laker fans, living in the past. Is it because the present is too painful, hence these rabid fans have to reminisce about better days?  .Lol.Coming from a Celtics  fan.lol
Kobes Black Mamba::No I mean lost, as in past tense, which coincidentally seems to be a common theme among some Laker fans, living in the past. Is it because the present is too painful, hence these rabid fans have to reminisce about better days?

---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::Seven seconds of pleasure - LA Lakers only have 11 rings  LAst time I checked we had 17.  Can't count either.OMG.HAHAHAHS.SORRY LMAO
Kobes Black Mamba::Celtics have more, your point?  Must suck to have been so excited before the season began, to only watch your team give up 100+ every night and be out of the playoff picture.
Seven seconds of pleasure::LA Lakers only have 11 rings
lakersfann1990::what about kobe dropping 12 three pointers against the seattle supersonics "thunder"
James Harden 3 point Celebration::what about last night?
Seven seconds of pleasure::<b> Donyell Marshall did it, too, so maybe he should be included in GOAT discussions, huh?</b>
lakersfann1990::thats a nba record who gonna catch that ? ray allen hasnt even got that close
bwp.bruce::Ray Allen doesn't hog as much as Kobe
bwp.bruce::You'll say anything to support your lover, KOBE
Seven seconds of pleasure::serious question to thunder guy:  how many championships do you believe your team has won?
thunderguy80::We haven't won any..YET....and I c where. Your going with this but the past is the past and we're talking the present and future in which right now the Lakers don't have....
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::Seven seconds of pleasure - thanks for the reply... i thought as much... it's really only Laker fans who claim the 5 banners won in Minny  Yea coming from a celtics fan.LMAO  When was the last time u guys won? Oh yea 1 time in the 2000s.....LMAO
Seven seconds of pleasure::thanks for the reply... i thought as much... it's really only Laker fans who claim the 5 banners won in Minny
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::And we are going for 18. ............BOOK IT
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::Lakers Are tied with the celtics with 17......BOOK IT

---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::Can't count ha.Do u mean 5 &amp; 6 to catch up.But the truth is that we have 17 face the (FACT).......Lol
bwp.bruce::Kobe scored 81 from hogging. The fact that he scored so many points speaks volumes about how arrogant and selfish he is than anything else. In fact, it is a reflection of how much of a me person he is rather than a team player. The shocking truth (what Kobetards don't realize) is that Jordan could have done that anytime he wanted especially considering all the times he was taken out of the games when the Bulls already had huge leads. The difference is Jordan didn't need to go to such arrogant limits to prove himself. Kobe decided that since he didn't have a good enough team to compete for a ship, he would just try to break Chamberlain's record. What Kobetards don't realize is that Kobe actually failed because Chamerlain's 100 points was his goal. Frickin dumb Kobetards just don't get it.
lakersfann1990::sooo he was still a laker
bwp.bruce::and you're still a FAKER
lakersfann1990::wilt chamberlin scored 100 he was one of the greatest ever and he was a laker
bwp.bruce::Funny thing is, he didn't score the 100 as a Laker. So again, FAIL
Seven seconds of pleasure::not when he scored the 100 ...
lakersfann1990::i love the lakers win or lose
lakersfann1990::even though i see a few rings coming
bwp.bruce::Lakers Starting Five After Trade Deadline: 1. Kobe 2. Favors 3. Gay 4. Love 5. Sessions
thunderguy80::I thought it was a joke when I saw the list but i had to dash all his hopes
thunderguy80::Ok what I miss?
Seven seconds of pleasure::the joke
thunderguy80::Nice try but no way the Lakers get the bottom 3 until they can get rid of Nash,Kobe,Gasol and Metta and no teams want their exuberant contracts..
Seven seconds of pleasure::you missed it, i think  re-read the list as a sentence
lakersfann1990::me and my fellow laker fans are always gonna represent the purple and gold so you guys can talk here all night and look into the future of no where for teams like the clippers, knicks, bulls,  and the thunder
lakersfann1990::i could give two $@%!$ about the celtics buddy pual pierce aint got nothing on kobe
lakersfann1990::you should buy a mirror or maybe get some laker tickets if you can afford them and look at all those banners hanging up and yes the laker banners not clippers unfortunately

Seven seconds of pleasure::<b>Kobe's FG% is in free-fall.  November = 58% December = 49% January = 47%</b>
thunderguy80::Fact is until A.Kobe retires or B.LA trades him they won't b relevant,LA needs to find another great PF to take Kobe's place and build a team around him and they need someone who is team 1st and won't blame everyone else except himself ...
Truth_Sets_Free_4::Kobe def. aint winning nothing without Phil Jackson.  Pringles dude aint cuttin it.
lakersfann1990::who else will put up 81 in a game like kobe did jessica ?
Seven seconds of pleasure::<b>Who else? Maybe Wilt Chamberlain with 100 points?</b>
---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings---------::Seven seconds of pleasure - ---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings--------- - There was no cameras.Oh yea his Jersey is hanging in the Staple Center.  You mean there was no shot clock, which made it harder to score that many points.... And what did Wilt bring to the Lakers? HAH  What do you mean what he did for the Lakers or with or the Lakers.2 Champioships FINALS MVP,2 times all-Defensive first team.Come on now.JUST STOP IT NOW.STOP HATING...LMAO
Seven seconds of pleasure::---------Los Angeles Lakers Dodgers Kings--------- -  There was nobody to challenge him.He had tall @ss body with a crazy wing span and played like a point guard nobody was big enough to stop him.Not like now when Kobe Bean Bryant had so much competition on the league.  <b>I agree, kobe is not an elite player who can dominate the competition, unlike the true legends of the game:  Shaq, Magic, Kareem, Bird, Jordan, etc. </b>

jessica_rabbit17::Rose is young u tosser Kobe is old!!rise has 10 years ahead of him and bulls can build around him,Kobe has 1 year left maybe 2 then lakers are truly finished!!
thunderguy80::the Lakers have big issues,u look at the top teams right now NY,Miami,OKC,Clippers they are all teams that have a team built around parimiter players and can get out and run, Lakers can't run and the only outside player they have is Kobe while he is good he is not great
thunderguy80::But the Spurs have good outside players something the Lakers don't have so that makes up 4 them being slow
lakersfann1990::yea right now he isnt bashing though

thunderguy80::I was just having a little fun with some trolls

lakersfann1990::well at least you arent bashing the lakers
lakersfann1990::people  try and praise the clippers but i mean come on its been 50 years and the chances of them winning a tittle are very slim given the talent they would have to go through i dont think they can beat san antonio
