ensign.devyn::Was at the game last night, good win for the Jazz. Should have been easier in the final minutes, but oh well. Wall controlled the game at times though, he was nothing short of awesome. Great vision, if there was a pass to be made for a better shot then he could get, he made it. He was FIRED up, tryin to ignite the other Wizards, you can tell he didn't want to lose. I attribute their run completely to him and his leadership. When he was on the court, Washington was much better, A.J. Price just isn't that good. Would be amazing if the Jazz could get Wall... Good game Wizards fans, I thought it would be close, the end was fun to watch. As long as you guys have a healthy John Wall (And Nene doesn't miss everything all night long), you can compete. As long as this team doesn't tank for picks, I can see them getting to 11th or maybe 10th in the East, if they play hard and follow Wall.
JPHoks1981::Gotta keep Carroll ahead of Burks the way DeMarre has been playing. -14 in 4 minutes is not going to get it done.
ensign.devyn::Demarre was also 0/4 yesterday in 10 minutes, and was on the court when Gordon and the bench did a lot of work, only reason he has a +10. Burks was on the court when Wall went off, and burned Earl a lot. Can't attribute the -14 to all of Burks fault, he only took 1 shot and played good D on his man.
GoTmJazz52::The Jazz 'bench burritos' did well!
Marek7476::John Wall 14 pts 8 a and one turnover in 27 minutes. Keep it up.
R Barron::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=bdz883e  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=atlsvyj
tatatatyler::As a Jazz fan both of these trades are TERRIBLE
Darkflame07::There is no reason for any of the teams but the jazz to make these trades. Philly gets much worse in the first one and why does OKC need to make any moves at all? If the celtics trade rondo they will want young guys and picks, not veteran expiring contracts....you know the trade has to benefit the other team too, right?
Real Deal Beal::he's doing something, its known as PRAYING.
R Barron::Alec Burks had a -14 differential in 3 minutes. How is that even possible?
Darkflame07::He was in the game when Washington was making their bi run in the 4th.
NYeltigre::No reason the game should have been that close but a win is a win.wizards look decent now too. Where are the wiz fans that were taking smack at?
bhlraven1619::With Wall not starting the season is the reason the Wiz are in this position. Since his return they're competing...
ensign.devyn::All right, where's the Wizard fan that said Nene would bully Millsap around all night?  Nene: 3/14 FG, 8 rebounds, 9 points Millsap 7-13 FG, 15 rebounds, 16 points  Talk about your all-time backfires.
cardsbluesjazz::Kanter needs to play more.  I know we have a log jam at 4 and 5, but Kanter and Favors both need more playing time.  Trade either Jefferson or Millsap, plus Watson for a solid shooting guard and maybe a draft pick in 2015 or beyond.  The Jazz have plenty of young talent, but its always smart to secure extra picks, trade exceptions if possible.  Watson is in Burks's way.  Corbin likes the vets, but you got to play the youngsters and suffer through some growing pains.  Burks needs the playing time to grow.
Darkflame07::Calderon is a free agent at the end of the season, just try to sign him in the offseason. And unless you trade Hayward or foye then you dont free up any minutes at the sg.
ensign.devyn::You can always have Gordo play the 3, which he does most of the time anyway, and let Carroll go, or reduce his playing time.
NYeltigre::Here is the deal. Everyone talks about trades but who do you go getm?
cardsbluesjazz::Very true.  With Jefferson and Millsap, their contracts run out at the end of the season.  Whoever acquires them will run risk of losing them and whatever they traded.  I wouldn't mind Jose Calderon out of Toronto.  Lets Burks play shooting guard.
scow79::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=baymb6e  I went bigger.   Done
mrmilanp::I know everyone is just having fun, but if you wanted to include a realistic Wall trade you should send back Favors or Kanter, not the old guys.  That's how you guys get a good young PG, nobody is going to give you one for Jefferson.  If you insist on trading Millsap or Jefferson you'll end up with a Calderon.
scow79::Grunfeld actually wouldn't trade with the Jazz.   They don't have any expensive long-term contracts for him to trade for.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::What if they add a clause that one of the players will get banned by the league?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I looked at the exact possibility too.
steeleute::How awesome would it be if the Jazz had John Wall
scow79::They're waiting to sign Chris Paul in the off-season.
steeleute::Don't tease me like that ha ha
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::LOL
steeleute::or Lillard as Tremors already said
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=b4dkejq Done.
steeleute::I like it
steeleute::A little too close there in the 4th Q for comfort but a win is a win, on to LA
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I really wish Utah had gotten Lillard.
scow79::I try to avoid watching Lillard.   It hurts too much.  lol  I don't think we could have gotten him anyway.  I think Portland was pretty set on taking him and we couldn't avoid the GS Tankers
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Cheer up, buddy. They're headed in the right direction.
scow79::Talking about this with you is making me even more depressed
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Only because that's essentially what they did to get D-Will.
scow79::Good point.   I didn't think about trading with whoever had the 5th pick.   Give them the 8th pick and the 14th pick for the 5th.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I think had the Jazz gotten the GS pick, they'd have traded up to make sure to get him. He's so good. Just owning the Pacers right now.
scow79::Ditto.   Had to get the young guys 4 games of playoff experience though.   Very important.
scow79::Yeah I can't see the Jazz trading him.   Just saying, if it was between the two.  Kanter would be leaving rather than Favors.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::No point in trading him. His contract is nothing.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I agree getting the playoff experience was paramount. I'm just watching the Blazers game now and wishing he was still in Utah.
scow79::I hope not.   They've already shown they can play together and they're both still young.   If one was traded though, I think it would be Kanter.  Favors is pretty much untouchable.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Jazz are not trading either of them. They're already good and 21 and 20 years old respectively.
Caps All Day.::Will the Jazz eventually trade either Favors or Kanter or can they play together?
ovechkinsgoal::i don't mind crawford coming off the bench and think he can add value there.  as a starter, he's just too inconsistent and impedes the flow of the game with his decision-making.  he can score in spurts, though, and that's a quality to have on the bench when the offense needs a jumpstart.
Caps All Day.::Wall, and Beal should be the only current Wizards on this team in a couple years time. Kind of a sad job of putting long-term talent together by the GM.
scow79::To the trade machine!!
scow79::Is this a life long position for Grunfeld?   Can't believe that guy still has a job
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Ha!
scow79::In Grunfeld Jazz fans trust
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Jazz could provide the Wizards with $18+ million in cap room if they were willing to deal Wall.
terpsfan45678::Paying Nene 13 mil per is fine on it's own. When you combine it with 20 mil more from Ariza and Okafor is when you start having problems. Now the Wizards suck and have no expirings or cap room.
terpsfan45678::Nene's contract wasn't ideal, but didn't have a problem with it. They had to get rid of Javale. He was (and still is) the king of all knuckleheads.
scow79::Did you like the McGee for Nene trade?   Another long term contract for a young big
terpsfan45678::He should have been fired 4 years ago when he traded the 5th overall pick (Rubio) for Randy Foye and Mike Miller. Or 2 years ago when he draft Jan Vesley. Or last year when he traded Rashard Lewis and his 19 mil expiring contract for the long term deals of Trevor Ariza and Emeka Okafor.   At this point, I'd say yes it is a life long position.
ghettoslider::ive been luvin' watchin tinsley play lately.. i hope he can stay healthy playing all these mins
ghettoslider::Lol
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::He gets a formaldehyde bath after every game.
scow79::Good to see Burks got his bi-weekly 3 minutes of play.  Unfortunately it was at the same time as when Wall lit up Watson
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I think this has been beaten into the ground, but I wouldn't mind at all if the Jazz traded Jefferson, Millsap or the like to get a top PG, start said PG, Burks, Hayward, Favors and Kanter and even though they'd miss the playoffs, they'd get good together.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Funny how Mo's numbers aren't that much below D-Will's on the season, for half the cost.
scow79::I like how you think.  I don't think we are getting a PG until next year though and even then he'll be playing behind Mo for the next 3 seasons.  No matter how good he appears to be.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Durantula is looking at a triple double tonight.
GeorgeTownDC29::MVP imo
Mattnimp14::Idk what you guys problem with Crawford is he makes tough shots and he sometimes does things that might stress you out but he has potential to be good.
ghettoslider::hes a chucker
GeorgeTownDC29::Inconsistent as f***. We dont need that
scow79::He takes a lot of bad shots.   I know this and I'm not a Wizards fan.
Mattnimp14::the more horrible the shot the better chance he makes it which is wierd
Mattnimp14::and he makes a lot of them to honest with you
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::We had a guy named BJ Smiles that did that for 7 years.
adajwiz::Wall only 1 turnover tonight on a BS charge call. He is starting to play more controlled and with better form/elevation on his J. Randy: Please start Wall next game next to Bradley Beal so they can get their chemistry going. Those two are supposed to be our 'future'.
adajwiz::Sorry, maybe the CSN angle I saw was bad. I just took the word of other Wizs fans on twitter on that play.
Shay Jacuzzi::Wall needs to takeover on offense more, not pass and stand and let them play.. for this team he needs to play more like westbrook not chris paul (I'm not saying he's as good as them now)
adajwiz::No matter how much he passes people always call him selfish. I don'f think his critics actually watch him play, they just assume he's selfish because he's talented on a crap team. It sounds dumb, but there was an article in which another NBA gm said he tries to be like Steve Francis. Wtf?!
mikeisildur::Joining the chorus of Jazz fans in our unbiased opinion that it was an obvious charge
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Obviously!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::He played great, but that was the right call.
scow79::How was that a BS charge call?   Millsap was there in time and outside the restricted zone.   Are you sure you're not letting your fandom get in the way of your judgement?
terpsfan45678::On behalf of the Wizards, I would like to offer Jordan Crawford to the Jazz for a medium sized vile of authentic Great Salt Lake water.
Real Deal Beal::they had #1 pick kwame "the stud" brown and crawford is your least favorite wizard of all time? man you must be a new fan.
GeorgeTownDC29::Bad far outweighs the good
Mattnimp14::I bet you were happy as hell when he hit that gamewinner though
terpsfan45678::Bittersweet. Steez is my least favorite Wizard of all time. And we're talking about a team that employed Andray Blatche. No small feat.
scow79::Every dog has his day
GeorgeTownDC29::Jazz aint gonna make that trade man
scow79::Plankton included?
terpsfan45678::It must include a plankton and/or a brine shrimp. Otherwise it is fair to question the authenticity
mikeisildur::lol
GeorgeTownDC29::Wash. will take Jefferson off the Jazz's hands (Not for Wall though). He had a crappy game tonight but has won them numerous games early season
scow79::Yeah this was one of his worst games of the season.   Almost as bad as Nene.....Almost.
GeorgeTownDC29::Nene has sucked lately besides the Portland game
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Jazz aren't trading anybody for anything other than a PG.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::BJ SMILES!!!
scow79::Hells no.   We just got rid of a chucker named CJ Miles.   No way do we want another one.
GeorgeTownDC29::Crawford?
scow79::Thanks Nene for missing around 10 layups.   Player of the game for the Jazz
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::No kidding. I couldn't believe how many of those popped back out.
redwiznatcapfan::Do the Jazz need a good PG?
GeorgeTownDC29::Jazz need PG and a closer. Maybe Hayward but I dont think he is there
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Most of the Jazz's best players are all 22 or younger.
scow79::Badly
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Jefferson can be yours, for Wall.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Cousins could be good. But he is so ridiculously underpaid. Sac would never trade him.
Knight13951::Wizards want Cousins not Jefferson.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Or if they want to resign him for less, that's an option too.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I won't. Jazz are trying to move either Jefferson or Millsap. Jefferson's is a big ol' expiring deal, so a team wanting cap space could certainly consider it.
terpsfan45678::hahahahahahahahaha good joke
scow79::I liked this so much I decided to write it out instead of hitting like.
redwiznatcapfan::Cool it with that man.
washheightsboy3::Missed the game. Legit comeback or garbage time run?
Jamal22066::Missed the game too. Those shooting stats look horrendous by Nene and Okafor. 36% combined will not win you too many games.
scow79::Wall saw Watson was guarding him and his eyes lit up
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Legit Jazz playing like garbage, Wall turned it on.
mikeisildur::Legit.  John Wall went nuts.  Wasn't quite enough.
rbmw263::Im out.   it was good talking sh.it Wiz fans.  looking forward to seeing what these teams can do with the talented kids
Mattnimp14::Wall &gt; Tinsley Beal &gt; Foye Ariza &gt; Williams Nene &lt; Millsap Okafor &lt; Jefferson Crawford &gt; Hayward
Mattnimp14::lol it was one f u ck ing game if you are basing it on that alone then yes Hayward is better than Crawford
Shay Jacuzzi::Crawford is d leaguer
scow79::I'll base it on every game I've seen Crawford play.   Dude is a chucker.   Hayward is a fantastic all around player.
Shay Jacuzzi::Crawford is $@%!$@ scrub, who's eating away brad beal's mins
Darkflame07::Pretty accurate except the Hayward one.......did you watch the game?
Shay Jacuzzi::Crawford is in no way better than Hayward..
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Jazz bench &gt; Jazz starters
terpsfan45678::You mean Jamal Crawford, right? There isn't a chance in the world Jordan Crawford is better than Gordon Hayward, and I'm a Wizards fan.
Shay Jacuzzi::Joey Crawford would be the best player, No one can stop him
Knight13951::I think he means Joey Crawford but I'm not entirely sure.
mikeisildur::Yeah but we're the Jazz, we don't start our best players.
scow79::Really?   Crawford &gt; Hayward?   Were you watching the same game I was watching?
redwiznatcapfan::Haywards better than Crawford, he plays better team ball.
chicagobears_1fan::i went to high school with gordon hayward, hes from indiana. and i gotta say, he is such a p u ssy!!!  last time  I played pick up with him he was the only man on the court calling fouls on people.   true story, but hes makin bank now so who cares
chicagobears_1fan::idk its true. Summer he was goin into the draft. at the brownsburg christian church.  Love the dude, but ill never forget that day.
rbmw263::why dont i believe you
chicagobears_1fan::but Gordo could take anyone in the NBA in tennis thats true too
mikeisildur::And Starcraft.
brg76::$10 says that never happened.
carbie10::Must of been born on a monday
mikeisildur::I bet he kicked your $@%, too.  Loser.
chicagobears_1fan::yeah we lost
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I played against Keith Van Horn. He blocked one of my shots and I don't think it's landed yet.
chicagobears_1fan::lol
chicagobears_1fan::yeah they suck i know
redwiznatcapfan::lol, Bears.
NO HOMO.::<b> I would be pissed of if I had to root for a garbage team like the Wizards every year  LMAO</b>
Knight13951::You created an account to troll the Wizards? Sad Life.
Knight13951::He created his account today.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I think his username is a bigoted remark towards homosexuals.
ksmit111::So to all those who think wall will leave after next season where will he go? Personally i believe the wiz have a good young core and once they get a few more pieces will be a playoff team.. furthermore their owner proved he can create a winner.. eg the caps
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Wall is a baller. I hope for the Wiz sake he stays, if he can stand losing that long. That's why the Clippers always sucked. They always needed "a few more pieces," but by the time they got them, the players they had got sick of losing and bolted.
redwiznatcapfan::We are so good we have people trolling us! Hooray!
NO HOMO.::Wizards are good?  LMAO
redwiznatcapfan::That was the joke stupid. I realize we have 9 wins but at least I can stick by team. You are probably a Lakers fan.
carbie10::Utah fouled a 3point shot with point....1 second To cover the spread ... What is worse the refs knowing or the stupid fck from Utah.  Of coarse he was a .......
Darkflame07::Wow you're a jacka.ss
rbmw263::The Wizards could make the playoffs in the east if they tried. ha ha. maybe. almost.
rbmw263::i just dont think they want the 8 seed. rather have the pick.  makes sense....
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I could see them being almost a .500 ball club... Might get it done. Apparently their fans would rather lose and hope for draft picks than being in "NBA purgatory" though. So I guess they're happy at 9-31
GeorgeTownDC29::troll obvious troll
NO HOMO.::Wizards are so bad they can win every single game and still miss the playoffs LMAO
Matier36::Is LMAO the only abbreviation you know of or something?
chicagobears_1fan::whos the best team in the NBA?
minky420::OKC for sure!
minky420::Jazz soon!!
NO HOMO.::Wizards  LMAO
chicagobears_1fan::lol maybe in 4 years, and they get rid of all their bums down low
chicagobears_1fan::......PACERS!!!!! bit ch es!
redwiznatcapfan::By June, The Heat.
rbmw263::hard to flip the switch
Matier36::clippers
mikeisildur::BTW I'm pulling for the Kings to beat PHX and threaten the Lakers' lofty 12th seed perch.
Darkflame07::Jazz dominated defensively, offense fell apart in the 4th. Wall took over and brought em back, I think favors was trying a little too hard to score in the second half and took some bad shots but kanter and favors both had nice games.
Mattnimp14::What seed are the Jazz right now and who's behind them?
rbmw263::7th with 24 home games left 17 road.  and teams behind them are falling like rocks.  (rockets blazers)
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::http://espn.go.com/nba/standings
rbmw263::if they get teh 5 or 6 seed they could advance.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Maybe.
Mattnimp14::Ok the Jazz will make the playoffs but wont make it out of the first round
NO HOMO.::<b> David Stern should remove garbage teams like the Wizards out from the NBA  THey suck every year LMAO</b>
Darkflame07::He's not a jazz fan......
ovechkinsgoal::# of championships:  wiz - 1 jazz - ZERO
redwiznatcapfan::At least we don't like our own comments.
taayox::st.fu
ImCheatn2win::Thanks Utah you useless bag of crap dropping a 21 point lead costing me $900
ImCheatn2win::Do well enough on it, just annoying  when something like that happens. I mean it's WASHINGTON on the road and they are up 21  at just about 3/4  YOU would think it was pretty safe
Darkflame07::Stop betting on sports.......there are better ways to waste your money.
carbie10::It was a fn joke..... Point ....1second
ImCheatn2win::Coyotes better win to cover my day haha
rbmw263::its not the jazz fault.  its your fault.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::That actually makes the Jazz playing like crap worthwhile.
PartTimeHomer::Gamblers amuse me almost as much as fantasy owners.
GeorgeTownDC29::We might suck but at least we are loyal. Sort of like the Jazz were to Jerry Sloan
mikeisildur::Look buddy the game's over, go pay attention to Sandra.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Obvious troll is obvious.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::They should. Can't play 36 minutes of basketball any better, can they troll?
GeorgeTownDC29::You guys hanging up a banner after this one?
Matier36::time to start wall i think.. only 5 minute on the court with beal? they are the most exciting pieces on the team... PLAY THEM TOGETHER!
rbmw263::why doesnt wall start?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I think they said he doesn't have his legs back yet, but he looked fine to me. What a baller.
redwiznatcapfan::That was John Wall at 80%.
redwiznatcapfan::They were "easing" him into the starting lineup, he'll start friday.
rbmw263::oh.  thought he had been back for a while already. guess not
fanofsports24::Jazz won and the Lakers lost....my night is complete
Caps All Day.::Start Wall
Knight13951::This season is a throw away season anyway, I say  let him ride the pine 'till he's 100%
Francis4345::Bright futur for those two teams
rbmw263::agreed.  tho i doubt either side will admit it. both teams have dirty 21 yr olds
rbmw263::plus/minus a year or two
Mattnimp14::@ NoHomo  MJ had the flu and beat ya'll so what's the f'ing excuse that shouldn't have happened
mikeisildur::You gotta hand it to Wizards fans talking trash with more gusto than most teams in a 9-31 season.    They made a good run, John Wall was fun to watch.  GG Wiz.
NO HOMO.::<b> I would me pissed of if I had to root for the garbage Washington Wizards  The suck every year LMAo</b>
Knight13951::Your life must be lonely  when you troll the Wizards.
taayox::You are a bandwagon fan.
redwiznatcapfan::You don't even have a favorite team.
Shay Jacuzzi::Why the fck is Crawford taking all of beals mins.. even in 4th quarter .. coach is horrible, change rotation and his stupid face.
Shay Jacuzzi::Crawford has a Sh!tty game.. one dimensional even Nick Young was better than him
Real Deal Beal::he didnt...
