Marniefantasia::kevin Derandt is so bad at b-ball
Liberal Feminist::Durant will NOT win the scoring title this year because, if things keep going to way they're going, he won't play the 4th quarter in 20 games by seasons end. That's a good problem to have.
winterfresh98::I dont want him to.  I want him to do his thing and keep the Thunder moving ahead towards the Finals and hoisting that trophy.
soonerbuzzy::I agree. Besides if you asked Durant what he would rather have between another scoring title, or a ring. He would tell you a ring every time. Thunder are looking poised, and the Heat appear to have a $@%!$ in their armor. Looking good for the Thunder!
soonerbuzzy::You know your team is relevant when they have the second best record in the entire league, spanking people left and right, and still people are trying to find things to gripe about haha Go Thunder! Keep it going! Western finals last year, NBA finals this year and maybe a ring!
mphilip87::Lebron: So..when can i call myself great? Kobe: Just be a 13x NBA All-star, win 5 titles and be the finals MVP 2 times... Jordan: ...Then win 1 more title be an All star 1 more time, a finals MVP 4 more times, become the season MVP 5x and u got it kid!
PlayerPresident1::where all the $@%! talking detroit fans at?  oh, they on the red wing board and waiting for spring training to arrive.
Jagermacc::pathetic comment.  I seriously doubt how many Pistons fans are on here talking crap these days.  7 straight Eastern Conference Finals!!!  That may never happen again in today's NBA.  If any team deserves a pass from the fans while trying to rebuild it's the Detroit Pistons.  You just can't stay on top for that long without a superstar anymore. Good luck to the Thunder this year... Pistons just need to find a leader in the draft and maybe we'll be back.
sjwalte::Yeah we are.  So what?  If you had a team this dismal you'd understand.  Only bright spots are Monroe and Knight.  Other than them, there really is no motivation to watch them.
robbienahm::A very exciting team but just too young not going to the finals
Liberal Feminist::They'll be in the Finals baby!!  You can count on that!!!
ok_sooner82::u just proved u know nothing about basketball,this is the same team that made it to the western finals and lost to the champions the mavericks unlike Dallas Los Angeles Lakers and a few others they have everyone back, who's gonna stop them...
Wudy Gay with da wainbow::Wussel Westbrook weally thinks he is somebody, little does he know he is a scwub.
soonerbuzzy::Are you Kripkey from Big Bang Theory or something?
96random1013::wat westbrook that $@%!$
96random1013::wat westbrook that $@%!$
Hawks_Bears_Bulls_Cubs::You know your teams a mess when you have 2 PGs and 2 Cs starting
zoooted::Stop it Westbrook! you're too good it's pissing everyone off, you should have taken more money
BilliamDollas572::if your gonna get zoooted at least smoke something good come to N.Y.C i'll get you some of that good o'l LOUD than maybe you could understand what's going on in LOUD CITY/ O.K.C!!!(&gt;_&lt;)!!!
BilliamDollas572::I really enjoy laughing at you so called OKC fans/clowns that would rather watch DURANT shoot 9-25 2-10 3pts for 24pts and struggle to beat inferior teams instead of 10-13 0-2 3pts for 20pts and a easy win wtf when was the last time the scoring champ won the title. OKC fans wake up this is bigger than DURANT now it's about championship titles he would probably tell you that if you asked him.
BOOMERSOONERSalltheway::Hes not scoring all those points because he doesnt have to anymore for the thunder to win. His teammates are good.
zoooted::1 durants not winning the scoring title 2 durants shooting 49% from the field, he usually has good shooting nights
BilliamDollas572::$@%! read and understand what im saying before replying to my comments
QUITE FRANKLY MY DEAR ILL SMACK YOU IN THE FACE::Get the ball to Durant!
Chex Lemeneux 6::Looks like Westbrook ball-hogged efficiently tonight
neal_co888::the box score seems to indicate that the Oklahoma City Thunder played 13 players in the game (with 8 players coming off the bench plus the 5 players starting), instead of the standard 12 man active roster per game.
MisterE410::Because of the short turnaround from the end of the lockout untill opening night, they are allowing 13 active players until February 6th, when it is cut back to the normal 12.
SpartanBball1423::Whats up with Stuckey's injury
MoreCupsInDetroit::PISTONS, Y U NO SELL TO ILLITCH?!
SpartanBball1423::Haha Illitch is a pimp though
ZeshawnC.::Because they would be looking for a new owner soon, face it. Illitch is older than planet earth. Gores will do just fine.
rrballer34::Why can't Lebron James write his Auto-Biography?  He's still stuck on the title!
_CelticThunder_350_::LOL
DetKoolAid::lol havent heard that one yet
anthonymerz33::That is very clever sir. Kudos
nccanes73::And if Kemba jimmer and rubio were so good they'd have been in the NBA years ago
anthonymerz33::you sound dumb...
Liberal Feminist::I see what you're saying but Rubio is simply NASTY and he would have been in the NBA 2 years ago if it weren't for his Spanish League contract.
nccanes73::Brandon knight or Kyrie will have the best careers of the rookie guards cause both like 19 while  the others are 3-4 years older and have somewhat maxed their potential.
Liberal Feminist::I think you can put Rubio on that list.  He hasn't maxed his potential at all.  Great passer and pretty damn good defender, but could work on his shot A LOT!!  If he turns into a decent shooter watch the "f" out!!
_CelticThunder_350_::That's what they've always been saying about Rondo.......
CosmoKramer1444::FACT: The Thunder have 3 centers better than Joel Anthony.
rrballer34::can you imagine the thunder right now if portland would have picked kevin durant instead of oden 5 years ago. i have nightmares of that sometimes thank you gm of portland whoever you are
winterfresh98::I dont want to, ha
gasoline417::if KD wasn't skinny, he would've been drafted before Oden. whew. dodged one there.
DetKoolAid::cracks me up still
DetKoolAid::lol its like the raiders picking jamarcus russel over Megatron
gasoline417::Lol! Forgot about that classic choice.
Liberal Feminist::Thank you Lottery ball!!  We could have easily made the same mistake
anthonymerz33::Durant is my favorite player. He does it all and whenever the pistons play him, I do my best to see if I can't go down there and watch him, but the Pistons aren't worth my time this year quite frankly.
ShaqLee_1::Great win tonight but we have to have more than Just KD, Russ, and Harden scoring in double figures every game. What's going to happen when just one of them have an off night. That was the Heat's and Okc's problem last year. They don't have enough bench scoring. I hope Reggie Jackson, Dequan Cook, and Serge Ibaka can give us some more scoring
Liberal Feminist::I've been impressed with Aldrich when he plays.  I think if the Thunder continue to groom him he could be really good!!
winterfresh98::Cole is playing nicely, 5 def reb 2 stl and 4 pts, under OKC he could turn into a monster, dude has power
rrballer34::james harden is our bench scoring lol
Liberal Feminist::I agree but don't ignore our Defense.  We can win with those 3 scoring if our defense keeps playing like this.
ZeshawnC.::good point Kool Aid, the pistons havent had much stability with coaching. I hope things work out with Frank, he seems to put a bit more emphasis on defense than some of the other guys. The players seem to like him as well.
DetKoolAid::yeah i remember when people were ready to cut billups loose. he was traded so much before coming to the pistons and even us fans got fed up with him but larry brown came and taught him how to be a leader and point guard. that equalled 1 win in 2 championship appearances. i think stuckey at the 2 with the right coaching will be a good for our team even if he is the 6th man. he is a tough kid
Spendocta::Thunder have sold out every home game I have looked at, but the attendance wasn't on the box score this time. Anyone know if they sold out?
airemark::sold out but not filled
johnnytwojay::i have season tickets  but sold the tickets cause i knew it would be  a blow out but watching the game on tv  i saw alot of empty seats
gasoline417::i tried getting a ticket for two, it was pretty much sold except for single seats in the upper deck.  so yeah, those prob were sold out because I checked a week ago!
CosmoKramer1444::Anthony Davis broke the all-time season record for blocks 19 games into the season.
gasoline417::Just saw Orlando scored 56 against the Celts. Wow. Abysmal.
gasoline417::yeah. oh so bad. 56 to 87...
anthonymerz33::Final? That's atrocious.
anthonymerz33::Yea Buddy Pistons bout to get a top 5 pickk
anthonymerz33::Yessir. I'll take any one of the top 5 projected. They all look good. But we def need a big guy to compete in the East.
Liberal Feminist::No this upcoming draft is going to be insane.
DetKoolAid::exactly lol i watch just to see progress and see how the team gels, but i want that top 5 pick this years draft is sposed to be deep
gerald_5::darko all over again??
DetKoolAid::JoeD's drafts except for the darko pick have been awesome. Memo Okur, tay prince, jerebko, knight, monroe, carlos delfino, aaron aflalo, chase buddinger and the list goes on so i will give him a mulligan on the darko pick because we won the championship that next year and got back the year after that. we would have ruined melo, wade or bosh and they would have bolted from detroit first chance they got
anthonymerz33::Hopefully not, my dude. This franchise means too much to me. The only reason I'm happy for the top 5 pick is because there's no hope for playoffs this year.
DetKoolAid::or knight monroe JJ stuckey again
CosmoKramer1444::Anthony Davis would do wonders for this Detroit team. He CAN score but his main skills are INSANE shot blocking,incredible rebounding,non-stop motor, and  great all around D(charges,rotations,man to man).   Did I mention his wingspan. Jay Bilas is going to have an orgasm at the draft this year.
Espn Jocky::OKC will get manhandled in the playoffs and get  b slapped like last year cause they are a bit skinny
airemark::Who did they lose to? The champ Lakers and the champ Mavs. In the playoffs for the first and second time as a young rising tea. Who else can say that?
YaboiBigJ::Thunder WILL go to the NBA Finals THIS year..its destiny...first we gave the lakers a really tough first round run..next we went to the WCF...Thunder vs.Bulls this year Finals #mark my words
rrballer34::thunder never got manhandled dirk was just a unstoppable force and if it wasn't for him thunder would have been in finals
gasoline417::at least they have some great talent. and good playoff EXP from last year.
YaboiBigJ::so i guess making it to the WCF means you got "manhandled" guys **SHRUGGS**
rrballer34::gtfo out of here wit that $@%!
Liberal Feminist::Yeah they made it to the West Coast Finals.  Great Point TROLL!!
RandyBanjo::They played pretty competitively in the WCF.........
DetKoolAid::hearing the okc commentators talk about how durants first two season in the league he won only 20 and 23 games i feel better about the direction the pistons are heading in especially with JoeD's draft picks panning out like knight monroe stuckey JJ maxiel and hopefully daye can get back to where he was last year...one more good draft and a decent free agency and they will at least be able to compete every night and heading in the right direction
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::I should bet against the pistons every game this year, they've been getting blown out in their losses. Even IF they go 15-51 (that's a big IF), I'm winning 36 more times than i'm losing
gasoline417::maybe do this for the Wizards too lol
DetKoolAid::not bad really, its no problem with your team helping you win a few dollars especially if you are a true fan lol shoot i see you on these boards 1 of the few faithfuls  so go make that money
h2thebern::pistons starting lineup? Stuckey, Knight, Monroe, Macklin, Prince......DO IT
pistons6684::That actually sounds pretty good...
gasoline417::Did they mention anything about Collison and how long he would be out? I didn't get to see it on TV, not sure how serious his injury is..
rrballer34::yeah i hope so we going to need him when we play lob city this weekend
gasoline417::ok thank you! prob just day 2 day
rrballer34::they said he sprained his ankle so im assumin its not that serious
gerald_5::this thunder team is looking all sorts of good...  i got them reaching WCF and possibly the finals
CosmoKramer1444::Brandon Knight and Monroe are the only bright spots on this team.
CosmoKramer1444::Knight is the PG of the future though, Stuckey NEEDS to be the 2.
DetKoolAid::Jerebko is a bright spot and stuckey isnt all that bad. people just didnt like his attitude last year but he reminds me of billups before he got larry brown just needs a steady head coach and to be playing the 2 guard..stuckey has had like 4 coaches in his 4 or 5 years in the league thats not stable enough for a 2 guard to learn to play point
cytm93::Thunder 2011-12 NBA Champions! #Lets Go Thunder!
DetKoolAid::respect to okc on not running up the score. it seems everything about their team and organization is classy. reminds me of the old pistons
ZeshawnC.::Harden been lighten it up today, he is looking like a young Vinnie Johnson.
YaboiBigJ::coach brooks is smart..in a season like this hed rather give his guys a rest then to showboat the score
Liberal Feminist::Harden is INSANELY good.  He's going to be HUGE in the playoffs.
rrballer34::james harden could run the score up by himself
rrballer34::surprised to see so many detroit fans on here this isn't the detroit red wings board
gasoline417::I've been a Sonics fan since 96! Had some major rough years, and now this team pops up, basically, they're still my Sonics in some respect haha funny, I live in OKC and "my team" moved to my state. I'm glad Detroit beat up on LA a few years back. good times :)
rrballer34::true ive stuck wit the st. louis rams for the last 6 years and its been depressing
ZeshawnC.::hang in there rrballer34.
RandyBanjo::hahahahaha
marcpru60::they were good when i was young, so guess will be a piston fan for life, even the lean years
ZeshawnC.::real fans stick with there team, even if they suck in the meantime.
DetKoolAid::we do love our teams lol i been jumping back and forth
DetKoolAid::okc is looking like they could win the championship this year. anybody but the heat
marcpru60::sorry, lebron looks focused, leading wins without wade
rrballer34::yeah and its kinda scary chicago winning all these games without him
Liberal Feminist::OKC can hang with the Heat.
DetKoolAid::yeah i know im just hoping that derrick rose is ready to take them out this year because he looks awesome this year
DetKoolAid::macklin looks tough i want to see him play a little more in the regular lineup
drewg1984::I agree. Good size, unlike Jerebko unfortunately.
pistons6684::Yeah he looks like he has good potential.
marcpru60::we will be okay if joe would trade tay for kobe, ben wallace for durant, ben gordon for chris paul and simply cut charlie v, hurts my eyes to see my beloved piston uniform on his just don't care back
rrballer34::scott brooks coach of the year k.d. mvp james harden sixth man of year and thunder nba champions lets gooooooo
pistonpower313::jeez, we need a scorer. someone that can just light it up. we need anthony davis.
pistonpower313::the scout report on him said he's a big man with shooting guard skills. very good passer, runs floor well, unselfish, and reboounds well. sounds good to me. he's just a little skinny though.
ZeshawnC.::BTW I hate watching the team get out rebounded.
ZeshawnC.::Monroe needs big time help in the post, we need a player that can crash the boards.
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::he's thinking about bringing back elden campbell instead to play along ben wallace and tayshaun. And if rasheed comes out of retirement, joe d is gonna pick him up too
DetKoolAid::yep agreed, i hope JoeD is still trying to get chris kaman because that would have been a good pick up
DetKoolAid::yeah all we need is an athletic scoring wing player and a center to help monroe in the post...one of those players will come thru the draft so I hope the other comes in free agency
tylerb1085::go pistons! lose one for the draft.
Slurm Soda::At least you scored over 56 points Detroit.
Gina_Hanson742303::Detroit Pistons vs. Oklahoma City Thunder   i found a site that might help:   http://bit.ly/y2PZBf
