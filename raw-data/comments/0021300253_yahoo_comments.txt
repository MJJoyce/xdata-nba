jammin400::Kevin Durant not getting to the line like he usually does but he is unreal today.  Simply one of the top 2 players in the game.
Zen Scholar::Looks like this year will be a repeat of last year.  It's clear that Miami, Indiana, San Antonio, and OKC are the above the fray.
CSONKA_39::Who was the fool who said Durant is nothing, it's all Westbrook? What an idiot!
topher::Durant almost has a 5 by 5 and a triple-double. wow
Eric C::That was a tough home stand against some goood teams, great sweep by the thunder.
gforce::Did Minnesota play any defense?  OKC shot 56% from the field and won by ten with only nine free throw attempts.  Nice game, Reggie.
Frank Shaw::Masterpiece KD. triple double, nice game
OKC thiefs::Lamb and Jackson starting to cause trouble. There have been a number of games this year that OKC have won on the back of big runs while they are in the game. Check out their +/- over the season.
Mark::Durant played like  he had a tweet to settle , Martin played against  one of the best,,,triple double, , lets move on.
Commisioner Patas::the best player from okc  (durant) playing 40 mins and the best player from the twolves (love) just entered the game when okc is breaking the game apart. nice coaching
