LAL has become LOL::NBGCDDFGGDF
LetsPlayScRyB::im surprised the boston trolls arent here
kidplay44::A 2 man offense is not going to work or get us to the finals. Brooks utilize martin more thats what he there for. And have westbrook to feed him the ball more too.
Mambaholic 33::Webrick has a horrible gm so everyone says!   Kobrick was AWESOME!!! so everyone says?  WESTBRICK: 17 PTS, 9 RBS, 13 AST, 2 STL....HORRIBLE?  KOBRICK :....           21PTS,  9 RBS, 14 AST, 1STL.....AWESOME??  FAKER FANS BRILLIANCE!!!
Mambaholic 33::My logic sucks? LMMFAO!!!!!  Here some help! God know its needed....It was "Sarcasm"  This is pointing out Faker fan's "Logic" - (Not mine) posted more times than anyone could count daily. It's called the "Double Standard" Kobrick is the biggest "Ball Hog" ever to play this gm period! And WB was just one example! KB misses that many and more shots nightly without the ast &amp; rebs...Last two gm's points to that once again. What Fakers could be when Kobrick "Chooses" to be a "Team" player. But the excuse will continue.... he's a shooting guard not his job! He's played 17 years in league! Gasol is soft! Howard is upset! Trade WP! Nash is to old! The coach sucks! He's clutch! Wait till Nash gets back! Pre-season doesn't count! The other coach sucks! We need Phil, 5 rings!....on and on and on!!!! You guys need to write a book on excuse, start soon it's going take a while!   There is no logic when talking to Faker fans, they have none!!!!   100M...4 Future HOF's....6 All Stars...."19-25".....Only One Problem!!!!!!!  - What "Sucks" is the Fakers and Kobrick!  You can delete you post now
MerajM3::I'm having trouble following your post...but here goes nothing....  Your initial post tries to say that Westbrook's stats compare well with Kobe's in this game. Your frustration appears to lie in Westbrook being called a goat and Kobe a hero in this game. Someone points out that Westbrook missed a lot of shots in this game and you questioned the relevance. Now I think you're trying to change the argument to include performance in more than this game. I think your logic sucks.
Mambaholic 33::Echoing Faker fans so called "rules" that continue to change daily! from gm to gm...Where your massive's plug in any non sense to fit there argument...Obliviously you have no adults fans to ask! hence, no need to delete
MerajM3::Ask an adult to answer your latest question...then you can delete your comment.
Mambaholic 33::So shooting % counts now?   -- More Brilliance!!!
tdawg110011::yes...

lakers2013champszszs::^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
LetsPlayScRyB::in NBA 2K14 maybe
belly999::just shy of a triple dub means YOU DIDNT GET ONE
NoHoldsLockout::what an insight
Bill GOAT potus::Oscar Robertson averaged a tripple double for an entire season once...
Bill GOAT potus::Turns out John Havlecik has more triple doubles than Kobe...
Elibird::yep
Elibird::And? It's just a phrase that was coined when Magic Johnson was playing. He was getting so, many. It was never really a stat anyone thought about before then. It's OK though, because he is 11th in All time in triple-doubles.
ozfezt::If Kobe keeps this up for the rest of his career and win 2 more championships he will go down as the greatest ever...
LetsPlayScRyB::its too bad he wont
ozfezt::IS ABOUT TIME KOBE FINALLY PLAYING LIKE I WANTED HIM TO PLAY...
Elibird::Really so, you've always seen him in a PG type of role instead of his normal SG role? Actually what he is doing the past two games is what they signed Nash to do. He was suppose to be feeding everyone and taking pressure off of Kobe to make tough shots. I think Kobe had to take matters in his own hands to do Nash's job myself.
lakers2013champszszs::kobes amazing
dro1964::LAL = LOL
Voss voss::At you
amarefan2007::D'Antoni is Coach of the Century if he and Nash have gotten Kobe to finally share the ball.
MerajM3::Kobe is now in the role of player coach. D'Antoni is now in the role of being present.
Elibird::I don't think D'Antoni and Nash got him to do anything. I think it's more like he decided that Nash is not the offensive play maker for this team he thought he could be and took matters into his own hands. First defensively and now controlling their offense, since he sees they need to be spoon fed to get off. Maybe D'Antoni &amp; Nash can take some notes on how it's done.
Loserland::Lakers have an easy schedule for the next two weeks.  New Orleans, Phoenix, and Detroit.  The NBA is trying to give a chance to one of their darling franchises.
Elibird::Typical hater talk. Stuff that just don't make sense. Guess what? They make the schedule before the season starts and not week by week as the season goes along. And yes the Lakers are one of their "darling" franchises, winning championships, having storied rivalries, playing in a big market, so yes it is one of their most successful franchises.
C3H6N6O6::No, they aren't. You are as bad as people who call Kobe the GOAT
highly debatable with extra sauce::NEXT FOUR GAMES WILL BE A CONFIDENCE BUILDER
chukhustle::I think they have set their selves a small goal... Get back to .500 by the break then go from there.
rahu0408::3-1; then 4-0 and 2-2... 28-28
rahu0408::Guys I predicted Lakers will go 11-3 in the next 14 to be 28-28. I predicted this before their two Ws. They have started off 2-0. Lakers will be 5th or 6th seed come playoff time... As I have always said, if I am wrong, I will come here and apologize personally to all the haters!!!   Lakers for Life!
Elibird::None of us are Nostradamus's decedents or soothsayers. Your prediction is as good as anybody else's.  The haters don't deserve an apology, wrong or right considering all the crap they talk just to spew hate even if they resort to making things up. ~Lakers Nation - No apologies needed from us.
passtheball867::thankyou , but you had me at "Guys".............................. you are making it to easy for me
mario91920110::I Am Eminem - It's easy to have a better FG% when you bulldoze to the lane and 80% of your shots are within 5 feet....  that was my same argument with Jordan..
Elibird::Well, the difference is the word "bulldoze" Jordan had footwork on the post and a vast array of shots as does Bryant. However, Jordan did get to post up more than Bryant and Bryant has taken far and away more long range shots than Jordan ever did. These type of shots are FG% busters. For all of that Jordan was a career 49% FG shooter and Kobe is a 45% FG shooter, that's only a difference of 4%, even though Kobe has shot more long range and more degree of difficulty shot attempts than just about anyone that has ever played the game.
Elibird::amarefan2007 - He should have passed a lot more. Just look at the last two games to see how much that helps winning. ******************** You mean Nash should have, that was what he was hired to do. Kobe was suppose to be able to catch and shoot more off the ball with far less pressure from defender as in the past, but it did not work out that way.
amarefan2007::He should have passed a lot more. Just look at the last two games to see how much that helps winning.
I Am Eminem::True or if your players on your team can knock a shot down. (Which LA hasn't been able to do for years with Kobe passing the ball) Kobe has pretty much had to take difficult shots
Elibird::amarefan2007 - Total baloney, eminem. He refused to feed Gasol and Bynum for years. ************************* You need to do a stat check Pau was getting about the same amount of touches he has his whole career and one or two years it was more. Bynum, when finally healthy was getting about 15 - 18 FGA's. Did you know that Dwight Howard has never averaged 14 FGA's or higher since he's been in the NBA? or that Shaq has a career average of 16 FGA's?
amarefan2007::Total baloney, eminem. He refused to feed Gasol and Bynum for years.
Elibird::Shaq is only 1 person too. I also think people forget or overlook on purpose the fact that Kobe and Shaq won 3 championships while scoring almost 60% of the teams offense. Only 1 other player averaged double digit points on those teams. Fisher twice at about 11 PPG &amp; Rice once at about 15 PPG
Bill GOAT potus::Kobe had Shaq for quite a few years...I think Shaq has the #1 shooting % on the top 10 points list.
CubicleJoe::isn't it more intelligent to work for an easier shot if you can get one?
gatorsrockjorts::Mark Antonio is a super good coach.  Title coming to Lakers this year.
HeatManZE.....::lakers schedule looks to favorite them to make the playoffs..that is if they can keep playing like this and kobe doesnt return to his old self
Blakemg1::The best part of this game was Durant trying and failing to guard Kobe down the stretch.
mario91920110::he is that good..
berdosux::Sometimes Kobe can just be unguardable.. He can be that good
C3H6N6O6::FACT : other than his rookie year, Lebron has better fg% every year than kobe's best year's fg%(47%)  and still averages more points per game for his career than Kobe 27.6-25.5 and has better rebound and assists per game than Kobe by a good margin. I am not saying Kobe is a bad player but please stop hating Lebron for no reason and calling Kobe GOAT. Kobe is top 10 all time if he doesn't do something stupid till he retires but he is not GOAT.
C3H6N6O6::where did i call lebron GOAT ? so according to you guys if anyone says kobe is not GOAT, you think they are telling you that lebron is GOAT?
MWP saves the day::We can call LeBron the GOAT if he is still playing with the same tenacity after 17 years in the league and has surpassed all of Kobe's achievements.
Elibird::First of all screw the FG%, he's shooting closer to the basket on his shots than Kobe has been. Second, sure you can say Kobe PPG is 25.5 career. He did not play much or shoot much for his first 2 or 3 seasons, so that will make it lower. However if you do Kobe's PPG as a starter you get a much higher PPG. Rebounds - yes. Assists - Not really, LBJ is at about 2 APG more than Kobe does. Kobe has more Finals and Championships than LeBron. Kobe also has far and away more bigger games than LeBron has also.
I Am Eminem::It's easy to have a better FG% when you bulldoze to the lane and 80% of your shots are within 5 feet....
berdosux::If Lebron is able to do it as long as Kobe then we can argue about it.  I dont think Kobe is the GOAT, but I think his career is still better than Lebrons.
mario91920110::LeBron cant be the GOAT he doesnt have that fire that killer attitude.. hes by far the best player in the nba hes held that position for about  3 years..
mario91920110::Le Brick Squad - Laker haters see 16 banners @ Staples Center and still say we "suck"...go figure ..LMFAO  I do believe none of the banners belongs to the Clippers....
el_dude00::Can we get an updated figure of what the Lakers must finish with to get the 8th seed?
Bill GOAT potus::Most years it 47 or 48 wins...this year may be 45-46
mario91920110::Good news is Lakers are only 3 games out of 8th seed
el_dude00::The consensus is that the 8th seed in the west will probably be something in the neighborhood of 46-36. So with that, the Lakers can really only drop about 11-13 more games, give or take.   So the Lakers as of today would have to finish 26-12 to finish 45-37.   but thanks for your thoughts.
berdosux::el_dude00 - I'm talking about what record they would have to finish with given their remaining schedule.  How would you be able to predict that?  No one know when the others teams are gonna win/lose,
el_dude00::I'm talking about what record they would have to finish with given their remaining schedule.
highly debatable with extra sauce::1993 nba jam...  i dominate with oneal...therefore...oneal &gt; kobe
ptglj517::...and robinson/rodman was pretty beast!
ptglj517::oneal wasn't in standard nba jam games.  he didn't want his name involved.
berdosux::It was Malone/Stockton, or The glove/ Kemp.  Get it right please
C3H6N6O6::It should be noted the only reason that Kobe can rack up assists like this is because he's such a great scorer with a reputation for being a ball hog. Players like Nash who are known for their passing are defended differently. If players start playing Kobe that way it allows him to score so much easier as well.    This is really just in response to everyone calling for Kobe to get 14 assists every night. You don't really want that. What you want is for Kobe to play however the defense is playing, if they're playing his shot, he needs to pass, if they're playing his pass he needs to shoot. He's ultra skilled on offense and he needs to utilize all of his abilities not just one or two.    The rest of the team also needs to adjust similarly. Play what the defense gives you. This is one of the reasons that Lebron is so hard to gaurd. Don't hate, learn from good players and enjoy basketball.
mario91920110::AGREE!!!!

berdosux::I dont think you know how to play this game...
highly debatable with extra sauce::who would you rather play one on one against?

Le Brick Squad::Laker haters see 16 banners @ Staples Center and still say we "suck"...go figure ..LMFAO
mario91920110::Le Brick Squad - Laker haters see 16 banners @ Staples Center and still say we "suck"...go figure ..LMFAO  I do believe none of the banners belongs to the Clippers....
el_dude00::Although, this win was big and I've been here giving props to the Lakers and their fans. Crap season, but hey, look at all those pretty banners.
el_dude00::When I say "The Lakers suck" I'm not talking about their championship years. Because during those times I was saying "Wow, the Lakers are deadly."   See, I can tell the difference. The last couple of years the Lakers have not done anything to make me think there will be a 17th banner anytime soon.   So right now, the Lakers suck.
mattht6::Where's this we coming from are you apart of the organization?  Did you go to practice and play those games?
opuesto69::So Kobe is playing OK because he finally realize that basketball is a team sport. By the way Lebron realize that a long time ago. Kobe wellcome to Lebon's game style, finally.
LosPolivoces::M.j is long gone..those years have past..Kobe is still doing the do..get over it
