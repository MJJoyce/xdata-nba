sanctie170::I've never seen so few comments for a game
RyanCarranza::People watched this game?
NBA_refs_are_weak::idk if it will result in winning more, but at the very least john wall getting nene is going to finally let him to start breaking out. its incredibly hard to have NO real scorer on your team as a PG, especially no one in the paint. hes going to start putting up sick numbers with a guy like nene who can consistently finish around the rim as opposed to blatche who wants to be a SG and mcgee who couldnt figure out which way to run
naddarians::even though washingtons not that good i still like the team wall lewis evans crawford and now nene
GiantsFanForever2011::Karman to Celtics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
cycycychris::There is absolutely no chance that there was 14,256 people at this game. But good to get a win on the board for the Wizards even if its against a bad team. Now we get a new start with Nene coming in. Now All we have to do is get rid of Blatche.
brady rodgers system qb HoF::nice work wizards. i still believe in john wall, i dont understand why he was getting blamed
ejhova217::FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WHY WASNT THIS NATIONALLY TELEVISED. EVERYONE KNEW THIS GAME WOULD BE SO RIVETING
infamous122::1-0 without young and Mcgee
NuggetsGooGleMe::Congrats on Nene too, he'll help John wall out a lot if he's healthy. Not mad at getting Mcgee though, he crashes boards and blocks. Him with Kenneth Faried? good night
Dstewa::addition by subtraction. good game from the Wiz tonight...
KSJezz::John Wall just needs players who actually want to play to win and he'll deliver 20 and 10 averages in no time.
NUNIKORI::Damn right.
WizSkin95::Good win wiz
J-SMOOVE2035::The Hornets cant waive Kaman.  If the Heat were to get him, it wouldnt be fair.
infamous122::they can't pay him starting salary
N.E.Phillyfan::$@%! YOU OVER, YOU DIDNT COME IN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CockJock::the wiizzz im the wiizzzzz
nyli516516::seinfeld
somjitprum::no one watching NBA.. MARCH MADNESS IS ON GEEZ
CockJock::suck a stiff 1
antistratfordian.::John Wall is a beast.  He should enter the dunk contest.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::This looks like John Wall's thank you game to management for trading away Young and McGee. Imagine what will happen if Blatche is amnestied.
NUNIKORI::I wish that happened.
dimesnz::shouldn't have taken overs, especially a game involving hornets.
N.E.Phillyfan::yEAH..FUKC !!
feeldabern::young gone, mghee gone. the only team that is worse then the hornets come into there place and beat them by ten.??? nba is such bs
