scottpilgrim36::Rockets suck
vonsteve1668::smart post
stop the duck::regular season doesnt matter....sixers just gotta get it done in the playoffs
drdlh1::They've definitely got to at least get the #4 seed. But even with a first-round homecourt, I still think they'd lose to pretty much whoever the #5 seed is.
LSUManiacBR::"We aint talkin bout the game, we talkin bout practice"- Allen Iverson
dt0504::remember when ESPN use to be about sports news instead of an hour of 2 stories repeated over an over?  I miss seeing the Rockets highlights...  Good sports reporters don't need a dynasty or a bandwagon story to write something worth while...not many of them around anymore...
jroll01971::injuries and the schedule collins is gonna lose this team its not looking good they need help soon
lin_the_beast::PHILLY ITS ALL OVER
truesportfanman::And now allen iverson is going broke. When it rains it pours.
MetropolitanFan::Philly sucks major balls
truesportfanman::The mustard's off the hot-dog.
blazers3333333::sixers lost to the last 6 west teams they've played. just sayin, you guys arent fooling me
super_lintendo_17::yooooooooooooooo
MATT5485::ESPN, please write a piece about how terrible the NBA refs are , especially Violet Palmer. PLEASE
blazers3333333::they are atrocious this year
bballguy2006::http://games.espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=6nspedv  Rockets get: Pau Gasol  Lakers: Mo Williams and Luis Scola  Clippers: Kevin Martain
bobbydagreat::Even though I don't agree with a few of the foul calls, the 6ers got to the line more than the Rockets did and more fouls were called on the Rockets than the 6ers, so it's kind of hard to blame everything on the refs.
CoreyGallagherArt::Sixers are 1-8 since 2008 in games that Violet Palmer has reffed in, 0-3 this season. Those 3 games, the Nuggets game, we all remember the charging foul, Spurs game, Violet was having her some Parker that night, and now this game...No further proof needed, Violet is a terrible ref who for whatever reason has a grudge against the Sixers.
Riche730::I dont think violet palmer was the only one to blame tonight the refs were equally terrible as usual.
WatkinsUSMC::muuahahhahahah sorry asssssss 76ers!!!!! GO MAGICC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CoreyGallagherArt::Can't wait til next season when you're without Dwight, Otis Smith is so stupid that he won't even trade him for value... Magic are going to suck for a very long time so root while you still can I suppose.
__sohum___::do the rockets trade martin to the wolves...yes!!
ThirdCoastTexan::for Kevin Love?
FlyGuys623::cant wait for baseball
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::last year philly was 26-29 at the all star break. big improvement? yes?
super_lintendo_17::SIXXX
picaac15::Why are there female refs in the NBA in general?  Just because you're good in the WNBA doesnt mean you'll be good in NBA Just because you were good in Little League doesnt mean you'll be good in the Majors
FlyGuys623::dont blame female refs. violet is just blind and sensitive... and a b.itch
showa_1::Doesnt look good for sixers after all star break.
showa_1::Brand has declined, but maybe because of all of the hard work hes done with no Hawes.  The injury to Hawes scares me because its been so long
ElectricPhreak::Hawes is much more important to the Sixers.
FlyGuys623::i only care about brand because hes been very good defensively
showa_1::If ......
FlyGuys623::if hawes and/or brand is back theyre fine
thethithua::Sixers foul on purpose so HOU can cover the spread... so ridiculous how they did not foul again with 13s left...
Riche730::Visit Paproblemgambling.com
leerey14::Spurs, Knicks, Nuggets, Rockets, and Hawks. All biased by refs, sixers won one of them.
rjerden70::You forgot to say you're an idiot
littlebabylalash::Its simple, you dont have your half court offensive and defensive anchor in the game, you turn it into a running game, Andre, Meeks, Williams and Young are ALL athletic who thrive in a run and gun game, Brand is missing, you run...  Collins is like that hack of a coach from atlanta last year...  trying to play not to lose rather than to win...
leerey14::Im gonna go $@%! in an envelope and mail it to a random address, just cause i feel like it at this juncture.
Desk Fan::swim?
Desk Fan::talk?
FlyGuys623::that expletive could be a number of things
Jthizz69::Philly is reeling...the soft early season schedule is showing. This is why it's so hard to judge teams until after the trade deadline/the start of the postseason.
bballdon32::Yea Spence can actually spread the court out and distribute the ball like a guard,
bballdon32::But if you think bout it, Lavoy and Nik have been ballin.
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::the inexperience definitely shows though
showa_1::no heart and no consistent shooting. William has been bad
showa_1::agree
ElectricPhreak::We've played the last 20 or so without a starting center.
Jthizz69::Portland has been what, 4 years now without their starting Center?
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::who runs the offense
FlyGuys623::two of our starters are out
FlyGuys623::not easy when rookies are starting
Jthizz69::that's cool, live with it. All teams have to deal with injuries.
bballdon32::PHILS 2012-2013 WS CHAMPS.. SMD HATERS!!!
littlebabylalash::Doug Collins gets schooled AGAIN.......
eaglesfan1723::kinda ironic how nba hires a bunch of $@%! refs...
MetsNLChamps2012::Violent palmer has no place in the nba... she is straight garbage
FlyGuys623::amen
crandall678::I would like to thank the Philly fans for being respectable tonight on these boards.  Sincerely,  Violet
littlebabylalash::Doug Collins PROVED to me that he is a very bad coach........  They were missing Brand who is there inside presence in the offensive end and there presence on the defensive end......  Brand anchors both the defense and the offense in the half court situation...  So how does Collins decide to play? By walking the ball up the court and playing very slow.......  Instead, with the lineup, he should be running and gunning and not allowing the rockets to get set......  Why play a half court offense when you centre piece of the half court is not there?  Collins is a fool and will never win anything.
Andre Igoudala9::NO NOT THIS IDIOT
ElectricPhreak::Would you rather we still had Eddie Jordan?
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::Anyone saying that we need to make a trade clearly hasn't been watching the games. We've lost a couple close ones on the road, and are in serious need of hawes and brand getting healthy over the break. We'll get these games back philly, don't worry
showa_1::thanks for being positive but we havent won any close games so dont know if we even have the ability to do so
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::i agree with that. i do not trust this team down the stretch
bluedevils1148::A rational guy on here! Who knew?
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::yeah man!!
blackzilla24::rockets 14-4 at home taking care business
Violet__Palmer::U mad philly?
showa_1::Nothing to indicate things will get better.  Dont know if Hawes will come back at all.
MetsNLChamps2012::LOL, just lost my bet by half a point... Took philly everything to blow this game
leerey14::Mets 2005.
chakost34::mets couldnt win the little league world series
MetsNLChamps2012::Mets 2 ws titles in half the time it took philly to do so
FlyGuys623::whens the last time they had a winning record
FlyGuys623::mets nuff said
leerey14::Mets WS champs, 4017
Violet__Palmer::lol @ ur username
etaUpike07::gg Sixers. Go Rockets!!
showa_1::I like Collins, but he has no shooters and no rebounders. Vucevic is the only bright spot.
bluedevils1148::I can tell you've watched, all of, one game. And liked your own comment.
chumboum76::Fellow Sixers fans calm down, after the break we will have Hawes and Brand back...and Indiana recently had a 6 game losing streak and they rebounded just fine!! P.S. No need to worry about the Knicks just look at their upcoming schedule lmao
KungFuZombie75::yeah Hawes &amp; Brand aren't the answer
mazariamonti_second_profile::but you would much rather NOT have a losing streak.
FlyGuys623::we need hawes
Frank Reynolds 6::Night guys. This sucks.
ElectricPhreak::Sixers just need Hawes back to his early season form. If they keep sucking while they have him healthy then I'd consider a trade.
littlebabylalash::0-9 from 3.......  Thats simple
indy3colts::$@%! i owe violet half my winnings now
bluedevils1148::12-2 with Hawes. 8-12 without. That simple.
leerey14::Cant wait to hear Doug's postgame this time.
chakost34::I first saw Kyle Lowry playing bball in Philly he played high school here
Philly All Day.::Are other Sixers fans calling me a troll?  I had my other account since 2006 called "andremillerand1". I changed it because it was embarrasing.  Just cause you other Sixers fans hoped on the bandwagon doesn't mean I did.
leerey14::u made your account like 3 weeks ago.................
bluedevils1148::You just said we should trade Iggy, Jrue, and someone else to get Anthony Davis. So....
