VCU_GO_RMS_GO::Great Job, Larry Sanders !
14lbenson::Go Bucks Go!!! WIN WIN WIN!
SayItAintSoTeo1984::I started betting with this online system called SportsBettingStar.  Ive made about 3K per month for 3 consecutive months just by following the system.
milwaukeemonster2::shut up ding-a-ling
milwaukeemonster2::thats what im taking about bucks!!! now stack them w's!!!!!
65tarheel::Gentry needs to be canned. This team sucks. Isnt it time to give Marshall a little run to see what hecan do? Why did they bother drafting him?
dwighthowardsamazing::I thought they would use him as the backup point guard and give him about 20 minutes when they drafted him and its not like what they're doing is working give the rookie sum minutes
NinjaCatNick::Curse of the Desert, rest in peace. Good hard-earned win for Bucks.
BloodBard::26 year old drought damn even the Washington Generals beat the Harlem Globtrotters more often than that !
OnWisco34::It was a 26 year drought AT Phoenix.  The Bucks have beaten the Suns in Milwaukee.  It's not as bad as it sounds though, they only play one a year in Phoenix.
dwighthowardsamazing::Monta is a great scorer takes some crazy shots but they are forgivable. can we get a Gordon for monta and udoh trade done please???????? (I don't know if salaries work or not) and what is wrong with ersan he looked good last year now he looks like total crap
dwighthowardsamazing::I am sick of Gordon taking crazy shots and they wouldn't he that bad if he didn't fake injuries I don't see why people don't realize as soon as Gordon isn't traded at the deadline he will have a "setback" in his "sore" knee he needs to go as soon as possible
colobr731::If you want Monta, feel free to take him. Most Bucks fans are sick of his crazy shots, backwards lay ups and 3/10 free throw shooting.
passwordistaco11234::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=a4a99ct
FORK2.0::We suck
arizonasting13::yes
dwighthowardsamazing::I do admit the games are more fun when your team wins but come on stop being a fair weather fan and shut up
FORK2.0::I am boycotting games now. Lottery or not. I just can't watch this pathetic performance(s)
colobr731::At least Henson and Sanders are playing well together. If only Tobias Harris could find his way onto the court and we could get Monta off the team.  If Sanders isn't most improved player, I don't know what that award is for.
milwaukeemonster2::prob go to some laker, heat or okc player...
Diamondbaks-Suns-Sun Devils-Cardinals::As many of you know,I have posted the message"Spurs fans suck." many times. So why do I hate the Spurs? Because my Phoenix Suns got SCREWED in 2007. That Amare suspension was totally unfair and unwarranted and it cost the Suns the key game of that series,game 5. It was totally unfair and unwarranted and it may well have cost the Suns the 2007 NBA Championship. After the tragedy of 2007,being a Suns fan gives me no choice but to hate the Spurs.
cheeeepono::i agree with the albino
Diamondbaks-Suns-Sun Devils-Cardinals::How bad has it gotten if we're losing to the Bucks at home :(
milwaukeemonster2::13-28 bad chump  lol
Cheesecake4prez::Manti is sick
orange-bruins-suns-jaguars-mariners::we are a mess of a team.
derek_510::SMH at "the jennings 3", read below bro.
derek_510::WHY MONTA!???  why keep shooting 3s!???  =(  you suck outside the arc
dwighthowardsamazing::He only took 3
colobr731::**You suck.  Fixed that for you.
YogaBeer::Is this another Manti thread?
Goon5832::Yal think john henson should start over lly
Calsaj::Not a Bucks' fan and only caught a handful of games this year but I'd imagine that would cause a spacing issue?  With guards who like to drive and kick you'd have congestion inside especially without that stretch threat.  No doubting that Henson is a better producer, just having that starting 5 together without a midrange/stretch scoring threat seems a strategic catastrophe.  They will start upping his minutes soon though, I thought he may have gone as high as Sacramento in the draft and his upside a long way down the road is the league's premier defensive player.
mr porkchop::Yes. Ilyasova has no confidence in himself. Maybe he needs a change in scenery. Henson needs to get better defensively though.
Manuel Karem::Monta is a maniac!!  When his game is on, he's the guard scoring equivalent of Melo..a true scorer.  Although, Ellis's game is more well rounded.
osterizerr90::yeah but not near as consistent, he should just stop shooting those 3's so often.. I'm fine with taking a few shots but i find he takes to many.
Goon5832::Ima bucks fan is it possible the bucks can made it to the second round of the playoffs
mr porkchop::With this roster, no. Changes need to be made.
J-Tjuan::It is going to require more consistent offense and Jennings and Ellis to quit jacking up ridiculous shots.  I agree as long as they can try to get the sixth seed at the least. I think beating the Heat or Knicks is a tall order.
The Jennings 3::A world without the Bucks would be a sad world, indeed.
diaboliko47::sorry fans but the nba can do fine without these two teams in existence
mr porkchop::sorry diaboliko47 but the world can do fine without you in existence. Lol
The Jennings 3::Yes, but it would slowly cripple the NBA into extinction without the Bucks.  At first it could survive, but it would poison the NBA in the end.
mr porkchop::Sanders &gt; Gortat
Manuel Karem::I agree that Sander is an incredible defender and shot-blocker, however he needs size He won't be an "elite" until either puts on some weight or develops some Garnett ego. It is an encouraging thought for all bucks fans for an offseason fifteen pounds of muscle on Sanders. His potential a very high ceiling.
The Jennings 3::Sanders should be in the running for DPOY if Chandler and Ibaka are, Chandler winning it last year was a joke.
derek_510::a joke??  do you know how much chandler shaped opposing teams' offense when he was in the game??
mr porkchop::Agree
NBA544::Should I activate espn insider for free?
The Jennings 3::If you can handle the people who will hate on you and make fun of you from time to time, then yes.
The Jennings 3::PHX, you got beasted on.  It happens when you play the Bucks.
derek_510::losing by 4 and winning the first 3 quarters is not beasted on.  bro, from the few comments i have seen you are not that bright of a fan, no more biased than the heat bandwagon fans and kobe dckriders
Rattmausch::I wasn't even two yet when the Bucks last won in Pheonix.. That's back when you could still consider the Bucks a winning franchise.. They won 115-107 and finished the '86-'87 season at 50-32 before loosing in the second round to the Celtics in 7 games.  The team made 12 consecutive playoff appearances from the '79-'80 season to the '90-'91 season.  Oh and we can't forget the seasons they had Kareem in the 70's.. The team won 50+ games 12 times in their first 20 seasons. They really didn't fall off and become bad until the Stern/Jordan era.. Though they did have success with Ray Allen for a few seasons but terrible management screwed that up.
The Jennings 3::Nice history, bro.
Miller Park After Dark::PROST!
dwighthowardsamazing::Why don't fans like monta? Is he problem in the locker room because on the court I don't see much not to like
Hertznt::He is not consistent with his shooting or scoring.
The Jennings 3::he sucks on the court for the most part, actually.
Clutch Klutz::Anybody know when they release the new authentic jerseys for NBA season? Example, when will they release the new authentic jerseys for the 2013-2014 NBA Jerseys?
tone3682::i know the heat will come through tho
Piston1st::Damn Gentry!  Give KButter some run!!!!!
diaboliko47::And at home letting the game slip away shame on you suns do some extra overtime volunteer work in the community or something
Damacon777::You mean Gortat letting 2 balls go through his hands? Yeah.
tone3682::he kinda tryed it was the players doing the turn overs and not making shots
Damacon777::Worst coach in the NBA for sure.
tone3682::iam never going to buy a suns ticket aging! i dont even want to watch them on tv lose why would i pay for it!
dwighthowardsamazing::Fair weather fan
arizonasting13::Im out. GG between the Bucks and Suns, two power houses. See ya next year Buck fans.
diaboliko47::So true its hard to win an nba Game when you make less than 20 a quarter
q351::phx couldnt even 40 points n the 2nd half such a bad team. i remembr whn thy use to score 40 points n a quarter.. the suns r a bad team
KN_WisconsinFan::bucks are super powers you suck so ur #2 heat are #3 (maybe)
KN_WisconsinFan::probably
arizonasting13::agreed, our teams should meet in the finals this year
Daryl_Dixon::At least Eric Gordon's max contract was matched. Suns will have money to spend in the future.
KN_WisconsinFan::good game suns  but you suck
