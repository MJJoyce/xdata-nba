DCHoya76::I vote Tim Legler for President/GM of the wizards! we need a leader in the front office and i believe he's the man for the job!
Rip City Forever::Two really garbage teams
MaurkicePounceySucks::Remember last year at the all star rising stars game when John Wall tried so hard to win MVP of the game, but Kyrie was like, dude, chill out, and sank 8-8 3 pointers to win it.  That was funny.
j_blaze1::Trade Vesely before he loses all value... call Kahn &amp; try to get D Williams
demongolem::Which league does he have value in?  Greece? Spain? China?
UMAD THO..::Man so glad that last shot didn't go in!!
JohnsonnnL::I just did my part and voted for Irving and Varejao as All stars.
OSUBUCKNUTS2009::lets face it the wiz are terrible the cavs reallllly need work but they can get there maye?
nargash::Can't wait for this starting lineup: Kyrie,Waiters,Shabazz,Zeller/Thompson,Varejao
nargash::I know it's the Wizards but again, Uncle Drew proves why will be the best PG in couple of years..!
justinmb1598::So, I am a Cavs fan and haven't really paid attention much this season. Cavs fans out there, what would you say is the reason we're 7-23? Coaching? Or just not experienced enough?
HunterF4444::Too young, not a lot of talent. Had like 4 or 5 game winners put on us.
mrdude5410::at least we'll have another couple years of good draft picks
Scalabrine2424::Well of the cavs had lebron they wouldn't suck.    I started liking the heat as soon as lebron joined. I didn't know who Dwayne wade was before lebron came to the heat. Who the heck is this Chris bosh guy #noidea #goheat #yoloswag #lebronismvp  Suck it kyrie
HunterF4444::Yep that about sums it up.
I Have The Pawaaaa::Washington losing too many close games.  It would seem they're always competing with only 4 players on the court
JohnsonnnL::Nice game from Thompson hopefully he will keep playing like this on a consistent bases.
DrawohWasHere::it was a good game at that.    10 double/doubles this season isn't consistent enough for the sophomore?
thebuckeyeryguy::Indians and Browns are still light years away from winning anything.  At least the Cavs are more likely to win sooner, since you only really need two stars and some adequate role players to be a good team in the NBA.  If Waiters pans out, then this team may have something for the future.  I'm still not sold on Zoeller though... and Varejao needs to be traded ASAP.  No more sentimental Zydrunus commitments.  Thank him for his service and trade for more draft picks NOW.
DrawohWasHere::Worst game of Zeller's career IMHO.    I think Zeller will be fine.    At the very least coming off the bench.     Still very much trying to learn the game while getting a boat load of bad calls night in and night out.   (which is one of the bad things about the NBA, if you're a rookie, usually it takes about 12 fouls before you get to go to the line.)  Tonight he was extremely slow on the weakside D when the Wiz trapped the SF.   His shooting was way off as well.    Usually he pops those 10-15 footers with ease.  I'm more concerned that Luke Walton has played well enough in the last 2 games that we'll see more of him then Samardo.    so I think Samardo must've started eating Big Macs again.  WAY too early, but who do you like in the draft?    Cavs have 4 picks at this point.    I'm wondering if it would be better to trade Andy for a SF that can at least start.
Ecas1::swisherrr
DrawohWasHere::It was a Merry Swishmas.
thebuckeyeryguy::Start printing those Indians 2013 World Series tickets right away.
basher316::it was painful but good win cavs .. good win
DrawohWasHere::Winning is a good thing.   :)
DrawohWasHere::+/- stat is one of the goofiest stats I've ever seen.  Anyone that watched this game all the way through (and there weren't many of us) Tristan Thompson played an outstanding game, perfect from the FT line, won the game in the last 24 seconds with his 3 point play, his 10th double/double of the season got a -9 for the game.  Tyler Zeller, whom had his worst game of the season while making Luke Walton look good got a +10.
yata-9arasu::Plus since he isn't an offensive minded player he was giving up pts to Nene and Okafor his +/- looked bad.
DrawohWasHere::Yata, I'm with you on the WAR thing as well.
DrawohWasHere::oh and btw, he's finally figured it out that passing to an open player is a better play and thus causing the defender to 2nd guess.
yata-9arasu::I don't put much value into +/-, same with WAR in baseball.  Thompson had a great game.  He is slowly getting better.  No longer being blocked and going up strong when attempting a layup or dunk.
DrawohWasHere::I'm really impressed with his play.   Is it time to let Andy go or do we already have enough draft picks for 2012?
towenstark::22% on 3 pointers. Maybe they should be banned from taking 3's. That may help. 14 free throws the entire game? Trade Vasely for a new ball boy. Great game Beal! Where were you...at home still opening Xmas presents? Can this team play any worse!?!
DrawohWasHere::A Wiz player did something tonight a fan rarely sees.    A dunk waived off because the player was using his off hand to dunk with by hanging on the net first, then dunking.    I think the last time I saw that I was watching a high school basketball game in the early 80s.
orange_63::yay!!!!!!! phil dawson finallly makes the Pro Bowl........browns season not a total loss......lol
Buckeyemig34::His jersey is the most popular in Chicago (of Browns' jerseys). Good for him, but still sad for the Browns.
yata-9arasu::Next is the MVP!!!
yata-9arasu::YES!!!  Congrats to Dawson!  FINALLY!!!
DrawohWasHere::Phil the Toe finally makes it.    Lou can finally rest in peace now.
jimkamlowsky::Pathetic watching two teams that are clearly in tank mode trying to not win a game. David Stern should issue a warning to both owners.
orange_63::lol...........tank patrol police, keep up the good work buddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DrawohWasHere::I don't think Sparky understands.    Our two teams really are this bad.
DrawohWasHere::then why did you watch it?
towenstark::I turned on the game and the Wizards had a 10 point lead that dropped to 4 before I could get a beer. They are too nauseating to watch. Question is, how many seasons will they get top picks b4 they get to 500?
Lane Kiffin stole my patio furniture::my guess is 3 years, and that's being generous
mc115p::Why did Beal play only 21 minutes??
DrawohWasHere::I'll go out on a wild limb and say it was more like Jordan Crawford had the hot hand in the 2nd half.
mc115p::lol
mc115p::thanks
DrawohWasHere::Sorry.    Couldn't resist.     I have no idea.    Maybe in the post-game press?
DrawohWasHere::Waiters was simply too good for him.
I Like LeBron But I Hate The Heat....Deal With It::What's up with the Nets lately? Now that's a embarrassment
DrawohWasHere::Nothing against the Wiz as this is for the other fans saying the Cavaliers should've drafted Jan Vesely instead of Tristan Thompson.    I think those were the same people screaming the Cavs should've drafted Derrick Williams instead of Uncle Drew.
MaurkicePounceySucks::I don't remember anyone saying the Cavs should've drafted Vesely. I do remember people saying they should've drafted That Center the Raptors drafted. But he sucks, too.
DrawohWasHere::I remember it.    But yes, not as many people as the guy in Toronto.  You're right.
Uhggly::really think Waiters would be more effective off the bench
Lane Kiffin stole my patio furniture::CASSPI
DrawohWasHere::LUKE WALTON!
DrawohWasHere::Might be right, but who starts in Waiters place?
Uhggly::well that obviously is a problem
DrawohWasHere::Was an off night for Waiters.
DrawohWasHere::Which, at 7 wins isnt' saying a lot.
DrawohWasHere::Scott has experimented with when he and Kyrie are on the floor in the 2nd half.    Tonight's variation is the one he's been using most of the time.  Waiters has carried the Cavs at times this season.
Uhggly::the reason I'm saying this is because it may help him get in a better rhythm.. and you can keep him with the starters as the game gets into crunch time
DrawohWasHere::Dude is like in the top 3 of all rookies in most categories.
Uhggly::dude is shooting 37%.. not many on nights make that
MaurkicePounceySucks::Just like every other night
orange_63::yes!
MaurkicePounceySucks::-Syracuse
MaurkicePounceySucks::I'm not opposed to it.
Uhggly::hey it worked there.. he could be a Crawford type.. he would get more play at the rim and develop a better rhythm
lunatuna45::They had their chances.
allwedoiswingames::wizards at least your not the Charlotte Bobcats
PartTimeHomer::Yeah, we're worse.
MaurkicePounceySucks::Washington sucks
DrawohWasHere::Did you buy a computer just to post that?
MaurkicePounceySucks::No, I got a job just so I could use their computer so I could write that.
RRobin_13::nash is almost 40 and is still an elite player!
Erban Legend was a good boy.::James &gt; Irving
allwedoiswingames::more years in the league
DrawohWasHere::Tristan Thompson has won more ball games in the final seconds then LeBron James at the point in his career.
Erban Legend was a good boy.::Won in crunch time?? His team is one of the worst in the league he doesn't win at all. You will turn your back on him when he leaves just like when James left.
DrawohWasHere::Stupid troll at that.     By Far, Irving had a better PER.     AND Uncle Drew actually won in crunch time while James bricked his way through.
Erban Legend was a good boy.::He was better in his first and second years as well.
DrawohWasHere::I swell a jealous Heat fan that can't get over it.  * darn m isn't working consistently on my type writer.
MaurkicePounceySucks::Detroit is
Erban Legend was a good boy.::Rofl nobody is jealous of Cleveland.
80watt::Did beal get hurt?  Not many min. In the 2nd half.
Paul528162::Thanks Washington just cost me a grand you losers
GeorgeTownDC29::The Wizards or your stupidity?
7649Jeff::Should of taken miami -9 with the rest of us man
TheTristanShow::You deserve it haha
PartTimeHomer::Why the heck would you bet on a 3 win team?
7649Jeff::I have been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar the past couple of months. I am making bettween 2-3K a month profits using this systems picks. If you search google for sports betting systems you can learn more about the system there. I have bet on sports for years and this is one of the best systems I have seen.
GeorgeTownDC29::Bet against the Wizards seems to be a good system
TheTristanShow::Can't wait to get Andy back but it was cool to see Tristan step up the last couple games
DrawohWasHere::I agree, but I'm beginning to think it might be a good idea to make the trade (if it's for the right pieces/picks) and let the young rooks play.    that was fun tonight with the Cavs starting 2 rooks, 2 sophomores and a 3rd year D League player.
membername362::Good lord there were 426 posts about this game
PartTimeHomer::New record.
RRobin_13::yes cave!!! wheres the $@%!$@% saying wizards easy money second half!
DrawohWasHere::Actually, I like the veterans on the Wiz team.     Our Cavaliers have Luke Walton and Bo.obie Gibson (good night tonight!) as the veterans.
PartTimeHomer::There was someone in here bragging about the Wizards? ... Probably a hockey fan.
DrawohWasHere::Worst 2nd half by Kyrie.    Looked LeBronish.  But another Tristan Thompson double/double for the win.
yata-9arasu::Yep.  Never seen him struggle that much.  Oh well.  At least we won.
DrawohWasHere::However, that was a gutsy Kyrie play that won the game with TT.     His drive to the basket drew 4 Wiz.  * and is why it's good to have a PG teams have to take serious driving to the basket.
allwedoiswingames::ballgame gg wizards fans
eelfan::fook you irving....make a ft!
GeorgeTownDC29::Hey Cavs, we will let you have the other Zeller brother in the draft if you want him ;)
DrawohWasHere::I wouldn't mind having the Zeller coming out this year.     We could have the Zeller Twin Towers.  It was a bad night by this Zeller though.    Although, for the rook, it was a tough assignment.
yata-9arasu::No.....  Do not want...  He is all yours....
goosu123::He is a better player than the older Zeller, much quicker and much more skilled. They definitely don't need him but people get a bit ridiculous when dealing with rookie struggles.
GeorgeTownDC29::please nooooo!
danglehossa22::This is so fuked up, personal take foul, do you have down syndrome Mcgee
gogamers::test
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Whats wrong with the Cavs this year??
quickbr0wnf0x::Youth and learning curve
iCandid::Injuries
goosu123::Nothing
EricTheYank::This is a preview of the NBA finals.
quickbr0wnf0x::That's what makes it so amazing!
EricTheYank::Even though they are in the same conference.
yata-9arasu::Never seen Kyrie miss this many FT....
goosu123::nor have I.
orange_63::washington fans in a good mood because the redskins are in the playoffs, so they can handle a wizards loss......
membername362::LOL that mood is going to sour considerably in the 65 games theyll lose this year
PartTimeHomer::Not in the playoffs yet. Unless something happened that I don't know about.
orange_63::oops, i guess you need one more win......my bad
GeorgeTownDC29::Pretty much
GeorgeTownDC29::Good game Cavs. That 1st pick will be ours!
In_4_Win::Yes! The Cavs Will Win!
yata-9arasu::Good game and GL this year Wizards!  We will see you guys in the lottery!  Lol.  GO CAVS!!!
orange_63::why do i think of silence of the lambs when i see those face masks??
EL_GRINGO_LOCO444::5 points in last 7 minutes?  nice job wash!
