Carmelloisfake::Happy Birthday/Valentine's day Byron Mullens!!, you sexy devil
Carmelloisfake::I know that its the bobcats, but it is really nice to see us score 100 without west.  It's crazy to see how much this team has evolved, at the beginning of the year it seemed like west had to carry us and put up crazy numbers for us to have a chance.  With West and Granger coming back, scoring shouldn't be a problem anymore.  Would love to see some improvement out of hibbert's offense, but if not it's not the end of the world because we have plenty of other options and hibbert can keep focusing his energy on the defensive end.  Would love to get Reddick, but if we trade stephenson, that would be a huge mistake.  In the playoffs we need stephenson to be the agressive one off the bench kind of like what collison was for us last year.
Rickster7218::Hak needs to be playing Jordon, he is the only guy that can give you offense...Why on earth is he not playing...I guess MJ is looking for the # 1 pick in the draft....
Royaljayhwk::Need to trade Hibbert....two guys off the bench played more minutes than him and were much more affective.
DWoe23::This Pendergraph guy has really come on strong when he has had the oppurtunity. I am finally ready to move Hansbrough if it would return Redick.
MasterOfLogic::NBA.com does a pretty good job at showing the triple-double. However, I hope something tragic happens to BiaSPN
yellowdart24::Pacers easily could have a 2 1/2 game lead on the division if not for those two OT games...
MasterOfLogic::Actually, 3 1/2 games... we're already 1 1/2 ahead.
WatergateSwag III::TRIPPPLLEEE DOUBBBLLLE
MypostsareconfirmedbyGod::The stupid Indy paper doesn't even mention it on its sports page, let alone the front page.
therealmikeb_::and no where near a front page headline.  gotta love espn
57Gerger::I started betting a system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made around 3K a month for 3 consecutive months now using this system. You can find this system on the 1st page of Google by searching for Sports Betting Systems.
De-Bruyn::Be happy to be trolled Pacer fans.When people go out of their way to go on your board It just means you're good.
pacerpride35::I'm pleased with the record going into the break, even though it should be better. If you said to most fans regardless of what team they support, "Your marquee player is going to miss the first 53 games of your season, but you'll be 11 games above .500 and leading your division," they'd be real happy.
SMANGANG::Paul George &gt;&gt;&gt; Lebron
yellowdart24::maybe in 3-5 years
EastCoastSurfing::JimboPeonyhecker created a ESPN just to troll Pacer fans. Sounds like a winner.
JimboPeonyhecker::Paula George is shooting an amazing 38% in the month of February!
Carmelloisfake::So thats what, like 4 games? lol hater
ontheinside712::Your main point???
JimboPeonyhecker::Paula George is shooting an amazing 40% the last 10 games
JimboPeonyhecker::Paula George is shooting an amazing 42% from the field
JimboPeonyhecker::Good luck the rest of the way Pacer fans!
Taco with a Q::Im out guys,  Pacers 2-0 against the Heat!!  SUCK IT HATERS
JimboPeonyhecker::Later homey!
MasterOfLogic::See ya Taco.
JimboPeonyhecker::real classy
BobGriffin::Paula George is amazing.   Top 75 in the league at least
COLTSFAN18959::Lebron himself said PG was the next big thing in the NBA. I'll go with someone who knows his basketball.
yellowdart24::Right now PG is in the top 25 of the NBA easily and has the potential to be a top 5 player if he keeps figuring out how to dominate with this length.
OlBoyP::top 15
Taco with a Q::Please dont tell me you wouldnt take Paul on the Heat?  Cause if you say no you're a god damn liar
MasterOfLogic::Please ignore him.  them*
JimboPeonyhecker::Sure he can come off the bench
BobGriffin666::I give him top 60
Taco with a Q::Your right, he's better :)
JimboPeonyhecker::He aint that good
MasterOfLogic::The most assists Melo has had in a game this year is 7. George has gotten more than that 5 times.
Taco with a Q::Melo is clearly the better shooter sure, but PG is the better team player and has way more upside
MasterOfLogic::Just ignore him, he'll go away when he's not getting any attention.
Taco with a Q::How about you get off Lebrons ballsack.   At least we are on our own thread praising our Pacers and you bandwagon fans are always riding Lebrons junk
BobGriffin::Get off Paula's vag
JimboPeonyhecker::Yo BobG lets go....Stay Real Taco!
BobGriffin666::Later!    Yo stop wiggin Taco.   Be proud of that white skin.
Taco with a Q::Wow you can count!  Im proud of you
BobGriffin::123
Taco with a Q::I would hate to have an IQ of 23
Taco with a Q::I was never fake in the first place, bye bye Romeo and Juliet!  Btw who is the female in you two's relationship?   haha
Taco with a Q::Well you can spray paint yourself if you feel the need to be black Bob, thats a solution
BobGriffin::Yo Yo Yo i wish i be black  -Taco
Taco with a Q::I know that, just wondering who the bi.tch is lol
MasterOfLogic::He and BobGriffin666
Taco with a Q::Seeing the Pacers destroying the Heat in person two weeks ago was a beautiful sight, and all the bandwagon Heat fans left early hanging their heads.   NOW THATS PRICELESS
20kevin07::Yeah I was there too and the Heat to br honest does not match up well against the pacers. P.G Granger and West will give them fits if they meet in the playoffs.  Pacers can actually win it all this year.
yellowdart24::IDK about winning it all but they have a shot at the Finals but remember this team can look great against the good teams (like the Heat) but look awful against others (Toronto)
HoosierHype06::lol the look of defeat in LeBron's eyes after Paul George hit that step back jumper in his face
Taco with a Q::I got up and put my hand on my face looking at the Heat fans behind me,  they were PIS.SED OFF!!!  They never said a word since then!
JimboPeonyhecker::Yo Taco be da hardest brutha around yo
HoosierHype06::ummmmmmm....... ok? ha ha? I guess?
Taco with a Q::lol my words exactly
MasterOfLogic::lol Melo shot 5-24 tonight?  George &gt; Melo
HoosierHype06::I said that before and a bunch of Knicks fans said that I was crazy and know absolutely nothing about basketball, has melo ever had 12 ast in a game in his life?
Taco with a Q::Knicks will fade, I see the Pacers snagging the 2nd seed
The Joe Johnson::George played bobcats Melo played Raptors so Raptors &gt; Bobcats means that also which therefore Melo &gt; George
HoosierHype06::well his username is the Joe Johnson so...........
HoosierHype06::not how it works at all, btw this comment is to the joe johnson
MasterOfLogic::lol okay  George had 24 pts and 16 reb against Toronto  So much for that, huh?
BobGriffin666::Yo Taco!  Don't let da man hold you down homie!
HoosierHype06::Pacers &gt; Heat Paul George &gt; D-Wade
Taco with a Q::No one is holding me down, but thanks for the look out
Taco with a Q::Ok Rob Parker
BobGriffin666::You be a Cornball yo
MasterOfLogic::So far they've announced the end of the San Antonio, BOS-CHI, and NY-TOR games... but not this one.
BobGriffin666::It must be a conspiracy
lboogie737::Look Pacer fans, I get it about the media. But, Did you know the last 4 ABA teams are still under contract are from the ABA to NBA. (DEN SAN NY IND) Look it up....It cost to print.      - Played 21 back in the 80's during Pacer's practice @ MSA.
BobGriffin666::Yo Yo Yo Taco
Taco with a Q::What the hell do you want dude?
Taco with a Q::...........
BobGriffin666::sup yo ...you down for da cause homie?
HoosierHype06::You are here why? to start fights?
Taco with a Q::Trolls hate me the most cause I do not tolerate them very well, tho I try to stay cool cause I like Pacers fans to be classy
HoosierHype06::Pacers &gt; Heat
MasterOfLogic::He's a Heat bandwagon fan, there's no logic to any of his posts no matter where he's posting.
Lakers Fan since 1980.::Paul George is the next Black Mamba
MasterOfLogic::Nope, nothing like Kobe, more like LeBron but not at that level.
BobGriffin666::More like a poor mans Pippen
BobGriffin666::Since when did the Mamba average 17ppg
Lakers Fan since 1980.::He's young, he's the next Mamba
Taco with a Q::I seriously cant beleive the Celtics combined for 19 points in the 2nd And 3rd quarters AND STILL WON THE GAME!!
BobGriffin666::I remember when Taco claimed he was a black man too.
MasterOfLogic::Because they're playing the Bulls lol
Taco with a Q::Dude thats a team I do NOT want to see if they somehow snag the 7th or 8th seed.  They are playing some good ball
MasterOfLogic::Ugh... those Raptors....
Taco with a Q::Ha, and I felt embarassed when we allowed 5 points in the 4th against the Raptors and STILL LOST
MasterOfLogic::These Miami fans are so bored that they have to troll the board of the team that they fear the most.
Taco with a Q::Its kind of bitter-sweet actually
JimboPeonyhecker::wut up homeboy?
ctown8686::Bobcats are garbage, their coach is a jack @ss
JimboPeonyhecker::So is the owner
ctown8686::Byron Mullins is $@%!$@%!
karelp::George on the way to superstardom...next Pippen.
MasterOfLogic::PG and LeBron would make an insane duo... even though I can't stand LeBron.
Taco with a Q::I agree
JimboPeonyhecker::So the Pacers will need a Superstar to pair with George as the sidekick!
Taco with a Q::At 22 years old I say his upside is still rather high even where he is at now
MasterOfLogic::....Still no mention of the triple-double yet....
lboogie737::It won't happen.  - ABA
JimboPeonyhecker::Remember when Taco with a Q was claiming he was black.
lboogie737::I'll take mine W/Pork   JK, Don't Talk about TQ'       - Sincerly, Gutter W/ a G
JimboPeonyhecker::I gave you crap for about an hour.   You were sooo mad and hysterical
JimboPeonyhecker::When the Pacers blew out the Heat you were there claiming you were black and then later admitted you were lying.
Taco with a Q::??  ok then
JimboPeonyhecker::I really gave you crap about being a liar.   And you go" the only thing i lied about was being black".   LMAO
Taco with a Q::You must have me mistaken for someone else dude
Taco with a Q::???
Taco with a Q::Just when I thought Heat fans couldnt get more annoying and dumb, I sure just admitted I was wrong just now
JimboPeonyhecker::Don't lie!    I remember
lboogie737::Indy 2nd in East.    - ESPN
JimboPeonyhecker::Paula George grew 2 feet this past year and is now 8'8"
MasterOfLogic::Miami fan I see...

Taco with a Q::Uhh no actually I dont
JimboPeonyhecker::You said it remember!
Taco with a Q::Lol yet Im totally opposite of what you just said
JimboPeonyhecker::Said Taco with a Q "Im a black woman"
JimboPeonyhecker::Paula George is the Greatest 17 ppg player ever!
ItsMatt27::Bulls are sucking lately.
Taco with a Q::Their schedule is getting harder too
Taco with a Q::We would hope so.  Granger is coming back and I hope he sparks the offense and I hope West's eye will be better too
ItsMatt27::I'd have to say Pacers as of now have the division in there hands.
JimboPeonyhecker::Paula George is the GOAT
Taco with a Q::Somebody wishes they had PG
Rexanilatorz::"Wow! Lebron made another layup! He is the GOAT!!" - Heat Delusional Fans
MasterOfLogic::Don't start sounding like LeBron fans...
Rexanilatorz::Pretty sweet night Pacers win/Hoosiers win/Knicks lose/Bulls lose
Taco with a Q::Celtics may pull this out despite an 8 AND 11 point quarters!!!!
Thehorseshoe20::i honestly think, Paul George is the most comparable to Lebron in this league in terms of does everything, when he gets more muscle and matures even more, he's going to be going toe to toe with Lebron for years to come
JimboPeonyhecker::LOL...Lebron was better in high school than Paula George is right now
JimboPeonyhecker::The Horseshoe brought up Lebron
Taco with a Q::Do you think we give a sh.it what Lebron does?  Cause Ive got news for you, WE DONT!!!
Rexanilatorz::I see him as T-Mac on offense, Scottie Pippen on defense
Rexanilatorz::I see him as Tracy McGrady on offense and Scottie Pippen on defense
Rexanilatorz::ESPN really needs to fix there standings
MasterOfLogic::Miami is so overrated.... 8-seed and they're #2 in the power rankings.
MasterOfLogic::IT would be really be nice if Chicago can lose too.
lboogie737::Reolcate a franchise, Get 50 FTs    - BK Nets
