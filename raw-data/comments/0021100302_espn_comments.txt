deeblock615::Please fire Frank......I mean losing I get it we don't have a very talented team. We have been getting destroyed....In the NBA if a team plays with heart, energy and passion they wont get blown out every game, they will even surprise people and win a few games that they are not expected to win. It is the coaches job to get the players to give their all.....Frank is not getting their all...but I know its the 1st year of a long contract so he probably isn't going anywhere.
deeblock615::The Bucks look really good....especially Jennings I think that he has potential to be one of the best point guards in the league....I like his mentality every game he is playing like he has something to prove....and he is not afraid to let the other team know that he is better than them. LOL and I am a pistons fan
perrypete::too bad he is not a point guard! notice that this team is so much better with him at the two!  he can still get his touches while livingston uses his ball movement and leadership skills to keep this offense from standing around!
GoldenDomer79::4 and freaking 18....I have lost my love for the NBA and only a decent Pistons team(which is unlikely in the next 5 years) can spark it back up.  So NBA, you’re below the NHL, MLB, and the NFL especially in Michigan and I hope you can get your head out of your 4th point of contact before you fizzle out completely.  Too many have-not's and a half dozen have's.  This is as far as I'll follow the Pistons until things change.
14lbenson::GO BUCKS GO!
ds174006::I don't want to jinx it but, Brandon Jennings is looking fantastic this year.
CandySparker::Hola!
LJMcCoy313::Dawg, my city playing like some BUMS! Come on dawg dis aint the real "D" we playing like the old clippers!
CandySparker::
oathsky777::FANS HERE? LMFAO
perrypete::why does he keep puting livingston at the two?  let him run the team and get these players involved, jennings needs to be at the two!
amscubs13::I'm pretty surprised at how well the Bucks have been playing as of late.  Hope we can keep it going!

Ron3758::I have bet on sports for a few years now and have gone through handicappers like women. Two months ago I found a system sportsbettingstar.com that is pretty decent. I have only lost 1 bet so far. It is a 2 game betting system were you double down if you lose the first bet. Im 30-1 doing this so far. Thought I would post this for anyone who is looking for a good handicapper

GetHype21::Bucks looking better, I hope they continue to win so we could see them in the playoffs!
APimpnamed.Slickback::Jennings is playing really well of late.
davidodinwilson::Bucks Championship!
ksesch313::im worried that by the time the pistons can get the picks to put some talent on the floor, greg monroe will have asked for a trade or become a free agent.  we just suck and im sure that isnt inspiring for him
squiddy45::Wow 10-17 from beyond the arc
APimpnamed.Slickback::Bucks win!!!
mpd124::way to go bucks now trade jackson
squiddy45::Yes
EvolutionaryMokeski::Was there a story behind Jackson's DNP?
Miller Park Mecca::Because he sucks?
squiddy45::No, he just sat on the bench all game... Not suspension.
Ghost Of Brett Favre::Wasn't that in regards to his skipping practice last week at New York?  So today was his 1 game suspension.
Michigan_Sports68::I just say tank the season and let the young kids play... Honestly you gotta give them some experience because we are going nowhere this year... Trade Charlie and Ben for some draft picks and just let the starting lineup for this year be: Stuckey, Knight, Daye, Prince, Monroe...
Dustin-32::i definitely agree except in my opinion i would get rid of Prince and put in Jerebko. i actually wish they would've traded Prince because after this contract he isn't going to be worth anything.
thethithua::how ridiculous suck a team can be when they cant score in critical times but garbage time they tend to score like crazy
DetKoolAid::@RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4  im fine we have stuckey he is a good player when used the right way, charlie v played decent for the bucks but when he got the money he has just stunk it up like ben gordon. that is not joeD's fault. its like you want to play hindsight GM but how is JoeD supposed to know that Ben Gordon would go into a 3 year shooting slump? how is he supposed to know that charlie V was just going to stop trying completely? Its about time you put some of this on the players for not showing up.  with prince that contract is a head turner to some but i understand it. after ben wallace retires there will be no veterans on the team. when that happens you wind up like washington wizards who have very talented players and no direction or leadership.
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::it's funny because i agree with you on stuckey. I guess you're right but at the same time i still have to blame him for not having any flexibility to make trades in case his signings would fail. Now we are stuck with these players. He got too inpatient and signed charlie v and ben gordon right away, he should have saved the money and waited for the year after to get bigger name free agents. Heck if chris paul wanted to go to the clippers i'm sure we could have gotten someone to come here.
milwaukeemonster::knew we couldn't lose to the lowly pistons
thethithua::15 points in the last 1m wtf is this a joke... fk u vegas
DetKoolAid::"RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4 lmao, joe d has drafted well?????? LMAO. Alex acker, ricky paulding, amir johnson, jason maxiell, will blalock, sammy meija, aaron afflalo, stuckey, deron washington, dj white, dajuan summers, Austin USELESS daye, terrico white. Hahahaah, he's definitely drafted well" ------------------------------------------  first off most of those guys you named were all 2nd rounders except for stuckey and daye i believe.   but its funny that you leave out Prince, Carlos Delfino, Memo Okur, Monroe, Knight, Jerebko, chase buddinger, ...and with Aflalo and maxiel they are good role players drafted in the second round. JoeD still has a lot of his draftees in the league playing significant minutes and roles on either the pistons are for other teams. sh*t even darko starts and plays pretty well for the timberwolves now.  You act like a couple down years means now we can forget the 8-10 years the pistons were a force, made 2 finals appearances, set defensive records and more all because of JoeD. If you look at the history and trends of the league this happens to every team! even the lakers had some down years after pistons beat them in 04
DetKoolAid::and in most of those drafts since the pistons were so good, they had horrible draft positions in a bunch of weak drafts.

buckspackers23::Hahahahahhaha.
Pujols sold out.::Yeah right lol
DetKoolAid::good game bucks, you have a budding star in Jennings he has really stepped it up this year.  but to pistons fans, what do you all expect? are you afraid to wrap your mind around the fact that the pistons are rebuilding and have said as much? you come on here ever night know they will get trashed but then you act shocked lol  JoeD rebuilt the pistons once and I trust he can do it again. the problem he ran into was thinking he could rebuild on the fly and thought bg and cv would play up to their potential. if that had happened pistons would have still been making playoff appearances but it didnt happen so now they have finally committed to rebuilding completely starting with knight, jerebko, stuckey and monroe. thats a good young nucleus
Pujols sold out.::Bucks will beat the Heat too.
BCmockingbird94-1::...they already have
buckspackers23::They have a decent chance.
Jumpman.23::Wow first time the Bucks have scored at least 100 4 games in a row since 07? Well, hopefully it's a sign of things to come! Go Bucks! Beat the Heat!

Pujols sold out.::Injury? Who knows...

Jimdetroitfan94::Pistons thrashed again.
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::look at the points per quarter for the pistons 16, 25, 19,15..........PATHETIC. Nice job joe d.
DetKoolAid::rebuilding is the key word, they are going to suck like every team in the nba who has had to rebuild....do you remember when kevin durant and the okc thunder only averaged about 22 wins a season his first to years in the NBA?
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::detkoolaid, i like your optimism, but why in God's name is tayshaun still on the team for 4 more years?? why, he has no value, he sucks anyways, i don't want to hear this "he can teach the young guys", teach em what? how to live off one block, then he has stuckey for 3 more years, CHARLIE USELESS VILLANUEVA FOR 3 more years, no one can be traded because of these pathetic long term contracts. BEN WALLACE is still on the F'n team for christ's sake. This is why i'm po'd
DetKoolAid::who compared durant to any player on the team? all i did was showed how every team goes through rebuilding and it takes time
yodaspeaks::Dude, dont compare any player on this team to kevin durant.
buckspackers23::Harris has a baby-corner-drew-gooden-esque 3 pointer.
DetKoolAid::im cool with the stuckey signing he has played at least to the value of his contract this year and prince will be the only veteran on the team next year so Im cool with that signing too. I believe bynum will be a free agent too, with the way walker russel has played bynum is expendable. So if JoeD finds a way to trade CV and amnesty BG he could have a very good shot at redeeming himself through the draft and free agency.   JoeD has drafted very well since the darko debacle so im not worried about that, but im hoping he gets the right guys in free agency
yodaspeaks::And in all of that...Still no point guard.
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::lmao, joe d has drafted well?????? LMAO. Alex acker, ricky paulding, amir johnson, jason maxiell,  will blalock, sammy meija, aaron afflalo, stuckey, deron washington, dj white, dajuan summers, Austin USELESS daye, terrico white. Hahahaah, he's definitely drafted well
mankirat 92::way to show how every year year you cannot get a solid player in the 2nd round, with the exception of couple picks. Also Amir johnson is not that bad, and arron afflalo is said to be the steal of the 2nd round we got him from. Dj white was traded draft day, Terrico had huge upside before he broke his foot. You sir are a dumb a s s!
schlitt90::drafting a daye was a mistake
DetKoolAid::its hard to say because last year he was pretty good spark off the bench and shot 40% from 3pt range. This year he just doesnt look confident
yodaspeaks::BJ 4 3's Pistons, 1...in the 4th quarter.
buckspackers23::Good, our schedule gets easier. Outside of Miami (2) and Chicago, out next 10 games get a lot easier.
dtjones0802::I think their is a glow around Brockness as he runs down the court.  Almost like a devine light being shined on him
Pujols sold out.::Brockness &gt; Tebow
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::this is comical, absolutely hilarious. What the F are you rebuilding Joe Dumars? A shack?
dtjones0802::In Brockness we trust
doc.roosh::DUNLEAVY! What the H man!
buckspackers23::Coach should've put Jackson in for Dunleavy. Mike needs his rest.
squiddy45::Yeah, give Jackson some garbage minutes
