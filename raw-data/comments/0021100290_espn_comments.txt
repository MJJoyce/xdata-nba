tarumpaw::lol if it were the big three of the celtics or the heat, who had bruised their thigh. I'm sure they will need a wheelchair to go to the locker room. but it is steve nash. and those things are just scratch.
Ghettovolcom::we don't even know what it is yet or do you...
Ghettovolcom::Steve NASH and aaron brooks TO THE CLIPPERS FOR MO Williams and Eric Bledsoe
JamalMAllen::Why would either team want to do that? I guess Phoenix could turn right around and trade Williams and get some building blocks or a pick or two. But why would the Clippers need Nash? You do know they have Chris Paul now, right?
Ghettovolcom::when we get brooks back
CandySparker::Hola!
prana19::gotta love it when you watch great athletes fight tooth and nail for 2 hrs for a victory all in vain... you could have saved everyone a lot of time mr referee and dq'd the grizz before they ever got on the plane to phoenix... thanks $@%!$@
Ghettovolcom::i wish you guys won too so that way we'd have something to rebuild by getting a potential superstar in the supposedly "stacked" draft class
EmergingInThought::Go Blazers!    http://www.whatthehellbook.com/the-book/     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=262l6tbHSlU
lakersdynastyisover::Alot of people on these threads talk sports betting. I have bet on sports for several years now. I have used easily a dozen different handicappers. Some were ok but never really good. I started playing this system called sportsbettingstar.com about 3 months ago. It is by far the best capper I have found. It is a 2 game series betting system but is the best  I have used to bet on sports. Thought I would throw this out cause alot of people here seem to be losing or searching for good bets
Inesperado19::<b>Memphis just got $@%!$@ by the refs.</b>
lakersdynastyisover::GO SUNS!!!!!!!
Mr Ntense::cheese
T_mac_3::steve nash to knicks for toney douglas and renaldo balkman
JamalMAllen::Haha, Phoenix rejects that preposal! Try again.
Orange602::yes, we need to get this trade done ASAP
Forkitout24::I am out,,,,Hope Steve is ok
Curs3topher::Gentry said he "doesn't know" what's happening with Nash right now..
16Lakers18::Just wanted to let the guy know the news so he doesn't waist his time listening to Gentry
16Lakers18::Tomorrows News Today    1. Gasol, Bynum, Meta World Peace traded for D.Howard, Turk, Jameer Nelson  2. Knicks fire D'Antonio  3. Nash retires after tearing his MCL/ACL
DirkNowitzki4President::you've said this a billion times dude and no one believes you at all
whydavid::Still want to know who D'Antonio is.  Shouldn't you at least correct the post before you continually re-post it?
gt1master_ike::IM from city in the midwest, best city in the whole wide wide world, say it now
whydavid::Can you at least tell us if we are getting warm?
Orange602::Tallahassee
T_mac_3::sashketchwan?
Orange602::Hot Springs
DirkNowitzki4President::Detroit
whydavid::Italy?
whydavid::New York
gt1master_ike::Ah, valid point
whydavid::Except when you confirmed New York was "correct."  I assume the song isn't actually referring to New York, meaning you were indeed referring to yourself.  Nonetheless, we're just having fun here.  I will go to the grave wondering what inspired you to post random song lyrics here, but I digress...
gt1master_ike::the line is from a song. im not actually referring to myself
whydavid::2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012  Semantics, I know...but there are 5 years there.
gt1master_ike::4th year dude
whydavid::Also further proof that stupidity will trump sarcastic replies every time.
whydavid::Look at his profile.  He's on his 5th year at a city college.  Cut him some slack.
Orange602::you said midwest, not east coast
gt1master_ike::correct
whydavid::Sacramento
arizonasting001::Midwest is all about kool aid
arizonasting001::Ya like kool aid?
Orange602::Cleveland
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::(.) (.)
Forkitout24::perfect set.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Yep
Orange602::flagged
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Lol  He wouldn't flag me
Orange602::no
gotigersmemphis87::Really
arizonasting001::Tomorrows News Today  1. Over 1800 Laker fans commit suicide.  2. Metta World Peace comes out of the closet.  3. Kobe gets tested positive for performance enhancing drugs.
Forkitout24::2. Meta and Dennis Rodman go out on a date
Forkitout24::or Kobe accused of another date rape
16Lakers18::yeah they lost tonight, they will get murdered against wolves.  they need to make a move ASAP
PhilMN16::Lakers lose as well!
klesk80::The Grizzles keep getting killed by these rediculous referee calls~!~~~Rigged NBA
kwhittington_91::doesn't matter how they were down... they had a chance to win late, and it was blown by bad ref decisions... Just because they were down doesnt mean they were goin to lose, and doesn't take away the fact that the refs were bad
trevorcabo::Sarcasm in case you are too dumb to realize that
trevorcabo::Yeah watched the game and not one bad call went against the Suns. Phoenix paid big dollars to make sure they won this game.
Griss13ears::True story. The home team is always going to get calls...that's the way it is in the NBA. Can't blame the refs for scoring 32 points in the first half.
trevorcabo::Memphis got down by 16. Thats why they lost.
whydavid::When your referee starts calling fouls after players are heading to the other side of court already, and then is convicted of federal crimes for his association with gambling bosses, then you can come on a Suns board and start crying about game fixing you sissy.
Forkitout24::Watch!! Nash out for 15 games!! For crying out loud
Curs3topher::Well hopefully Gentry will say something about it during the press conference which is next....
Forkitout24::yikes
16Lakers18::I was watching it on League Pass, heard Grizzles commentator say he heard something pop.
Curs3topher::Have you heard anything yet on what happened?
16Lakers18::Yeah maybe if he goes to Germany
16Lakers18::Tomorrows News Today    1. Gasol, Bynum, Meta World Peace traded for D.Howard, Turk, Jameer Nelson  2. Knicks fire D'Antonio  3. Nash retires after tearing his MCL/ACL
trevorcabo::What makes you think Howard wants to play for the lakers without Gasol?
Forkitout24::#3 is false. He will go out in style
DirkNowitzki4President::#1 is false
Curs3topher::I was listening on the Radio and they're obviously not gonna show or tell anything about Nash on the postgame live. Seriously we can't afford to lose the only player winning our games....
gt1master_ike::conley still pissed from the other night against the clippers
16Lakers18::Nash did not bang knees with anyone.  It was something else.
Snakes_::booooo
Spurzoffury::Nash is a much better player than anyone on Memphis! Except maybe the ga y dude!
rainydaymanualmemphis::hahahahahahahahahahha are you mentally challenged or 10 years old?
grzz32::they should give the ball to mayo
Benjamayne::rudy sent it to OT the last time
rainydaymanualmemphis::conley definitely doesn't need to be shooting the last shot
Griss13ears::I think it should always be on Rudy. Even when Zach comes back. He is the only real clutch player we have.
Griss13ears::Goddammit. We can't win on the road for s.hit. good game suns. Hope nash is ok.
Griss13ears::I was being facetious. We should've at least come back from this road stretch 2-2. we also beat new orleans and minnesota. christ.
rainydaymanualmemphis::so we didn't beat golden state?
danielsdbacks.::why is ears in ur username
16Lakers18::you have more road wins that us
klesk80::The Grizzles are getting killed by these rediculous referee calls~! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~~
trevorcabo::Dont get down by 16 and it wont come down to calls in last minute
DirkNowitzki4President::The Western Conference standings make no sense from numbers 4-8
BenBarba::Suns will finish with about 15 wins for the season....nothing more
arizonasting001::fine by me. better draft pick.
Slurm Soda::Nash is done for the season from what I'm hearing
Slurm Soda::I'm just kidding.
arizonasting001::you're a Suns trainer?
16Lakers18::he should have been on the bench, what was he doing play defense?
jbreit11::bet he plays in the next week
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::Yes!!!!!!! An excellent win against a decent team. This feels really good. A round of applause for the Suns for this win.
kwhittington_91::grizz aren't just a decent team... didn't have our best player... not harping on your win, just saying that people give the grizz a lot less respect than they should get
rainydaymanualmemphis::you got lucky from poor referring you moron
whydavid::Is it a hard and fast rule that your spelling and grammar have to be atrocious if you are going to call someone else a moron on the internet?
jbreit11::well actually the suns choked since they gave up that huge lead. memphis just couldnt overcome the turnovers and fouls late in the game
kwhittington_91::if by fouls, you mean bad reffing, then yea you're right
lasvgsjoe::wow..had memphis -4 and stil couldn't beat the crappy suns...wow.
gt1master_ike::The suns used their go go go go go go go go go go gadget flow to win tonight
Spurzoffury::Wher are the Memphis fans now? Awhile ago they were talking more sh it than a laxative!
rainydaymanualmemphis::hey btw the team you cheer for is the most boring display of professional athletics on the planet... . congrats.
Nuggets-Wilson Chandler::yea spurs sucks nuggets all the way!
trevorcabo::Just like spur fans during last nights joke of a loss
rainydaymanualmemphis::sounds like your vaj still hurts from us beating your sorry, decrepit team in the playoffs last year
Curs3topher::I sincerely hope Nash is ok.....If he goes down there goes any shot at winning ANY games!
Spurzoffury::NBA conspiracy, Memphis will never make it to Finals!
16Lakers18::no conspiracy, they were really close to making the Western finals last year.  wait till they get healthy
Spurzoffury::Still won't make it!
Infamous3735::suns should thank the refs for making that foul call at the end
cleb976::why thank them for doing their jobs, those were both fouls
Benjamayne::they usually don't when they're biased to the home team
Infamous3735::they showed one replay and the announcers didn't even mention it
Nuggets-Wilson Chandler::is not even that is that the grizzlies always start of slow
penn4414::not one but two...........
16Lakers18::Tomorrows News Today  1.  Gasol, Bynum, Meta World Peace traded for D.Howard, Turk, Jameer Nelson 2. Knicks fire D'Antonio 3. Nash retires after tearing his MCL/ACL
rosebwlbound::That would be one of the worst trades ever lol all bums on the lakers side
Applecider1999::D'antoni is knicks head coach
DirkNowitzki4President::I only agree with #2
whydavid::Who's D'Antonio?  He sounds exotic.
trevorcabo::You people are idiots. How many of you said Nash;s career just ended cause he banged his knee? Ridiculous
The Beard of Paul Allen::Nash out for season
arizonasting001::your beard is weird. your stache is trash.
penn4414::these games are so fixed!!
cleb976::For calling obvious fouls?
DirkNowitzki4President::In the Western Conference every game matters. Not so much for the East
Spurzoffury::Grizzlies choke on big one, film at eleven!
PhilMN16::Nevermind. He got back up. Good for Nash. Lol.
arizonasting001::Nash will be fine. He plays through injuries all the time.

Mr Ntense::good win
Benjamayne::there was a bs and 1 that the suns got, then a bs call on marc gasol, then a bs tripping call
Spurzoffury::Hey Memphis, what's that I hear? A loser!
whydavid::At least the Memphis fans aren't "liking" their own comments.  And yes, I know, my mom does like her own comments.
Benjamayne::wait till ur old farts are in memphis and get sent crying home
arizonasting001::or maybe your mother.
Spurzoffury::No, I don't back sorry teams like you!
DirkNowitzki4President::Lakers are #10 in the west
16Lakers18::yeah
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::LOL
Snakes_::Looks like Nash just banged his knee. If it was serious he would've stayed down.   But then again... he's Canadian. So he could've been taking it like a champ...
yosellindreams::Refs win scored the last 4 pts for the suns
PhilMN16::That is the career. Very nice career Nash. But I think that is it.
Spurzoffury::Talk $h it now Memphis fans!
Griss13ears::We  beat the f.ucking s.hit out of you in the playoffs last year. Go f.uck yourself you worthless piece of s.hit
