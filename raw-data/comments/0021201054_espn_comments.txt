Jamaal 43::smh Melo's shooting numbers are misleading because he gets those tough basket inside where he gets hit and puts the ball back up for three point plays going to the line. Also, the Knicks play better playing through Melo in the post; that’s why they had that hot start and why they are playing well now.   If the other team doesn't send the double team; Melo goes to work, goes to the line and puts the other team in the bonus . . . that’s good for the Knicks.
slimgoodie38::felton was averaging 18 in melos absence now 6 since his return team ball is always better when everybody gets involed!
weoutnyc::Obviously people here didnt actually watch the game if they are complaining about Melos shooting percentage.  Bunch of hating idiotic meatheads, you probably all live at home with your parents and have no jobs. Your only happiness in life is going out of your way on an internet blog to try and slight one of the top 10 ball players in the league.  But hey, to each his own I suppose.
slimgoodie38::stop dick riding he good but he shoot to dam much the other guys are sacrificing there game.
greenbean47::internet porn is #1.  trolling is #2 in my book.
Michigan8-4LOL::1973
Michigan8-4LOL::29 pts on 30 shots.   mELO MVP ROFL
thoughtuknew73::If Miami isn't hitting the 3 they can still win can't say that about the Knicks cause that's their only style of play. Check out their record when the other team hits more 3's then check out Miami's record
weoutnyc::How about you show us that record.  Idiot.
Dirty-Diaper::Wow Melo went 10-30 from the field and Boston still lost. Imagine how good NY could be if Melo wasn't such a ball hog.
Saddam Hussein al bagdaddy::Boston couldnt do it if melo had 1 hand behind his back. Thats how bad it was. And thats how bad boston is.
thoughtuknew73::I really don't like Colin Cowherd
thoughtuknew73::Melo is the only thing the Knicks have. U think he sucks but u probably love KD
thoughtuknew73::Y does he hate on Melo so much
FightinMs::because melo sucks
Mets-Jets-Knicks-Isles19::gives new meaning to sarcasim
thoughtuknew73::First it was Stat, then Melo, then Lin, JR, Kidd &amp; now Martin is the savior. Get real NY team going nowhere. Knicks style of play &amp; old a$$ players make them 1st round exit
thoughtuknew73::25 total NBA doesn't sound like teams rely on the 3's. Look at your team
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::wow...what a strong argument: "doesnt sound like"  the heat shoot over 20 threes a game...like a third of their shot attempts  its ok to be wrong sometimes.
thoughtuknew73::Y are u here? U don't seem to know anything about basketball. Shooting 3's as part of a games flow is different then relying on them
The_JTrain_3000::the fact of the matter is, the heat take a but load of threes for the pace they play at.  They need the three ball to spread the floor, that's why every role player on the heat shoots threes you t.ard
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::about 25% of all FGA in the NBA are 3pointers. the league is a chuck. pretty obvious so go back and fix your post
thoughtuknew73::U can be successful but not a champion. Game slows down
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::yeah the heat dont shoot a lot of 3s...lol
thoughtuknew73::It will be. Running around shooting 3's don't win championships.
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::the only teams in the NBA that dont rely on 3pters is the Grizzlies and Bulls. Troll knows nothing about basketball
The_JTrain_3000::actually there are several teams who have had great success with the three ball.  Also, if you watched thee game, you would notice that they are perfectly capable of driving it into the paint
The_JTrain_3000::they might even play milwaukee lol.  This celtics team is also losing it.  All easy
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::this guy is a troll that probably got pushed around when he visited NYC
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::cliche troll reply
thoughtuknew73::U hate the truth
Mets-Jets-Knicks-Isles19::Martin isn't a savior...just a good pick up....and the Knicks are more than likely playing Atlanta...doubt that's a first round exit.
thoughtuknew73::Now Knicks fan think they are contenders LOL
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::not going to win the title but what's wrong with fans being excited about a much improved team that is #2 in the east?
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::they are like 55-25 under Mike woodson...is that enough games for you troll?
thoughtuknew73::So after 5 games they're much improved???? What a joke
Mets-Jets-Knicks-Isles19::exactly
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::they've been unhealthy contenders all year
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::not to mentioned they've already beaten most of the teams that are "contenders" this season (MIA, SA)
Mets-Jets-Knicks-Isles19::being in the playoffs is contending...so yes
chieftech714::anybody else want to use the exemption on stats? I want him gone or traded. we need some young bodies not overpaid old ones.
chieftech714::gogobananas rude comment has been confirmed. We already used ours...SIGHGHGHG. we are stuck.
GoGoBananas34::Knicks used their exemption   try getting a clue
chieftech714::who did we amnesty?
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::its hard to say because he's been my favorite player since Penny Hardaway to be honest (ironic that they both had the same injury).  I think they'll have to explore amnestying him as a possibility, but I think they'll also take into consideration what he did for NY before Melo got there.  Probably won't trade him unless its to a contender he chooses.
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::knicks used amnesty on billups to sign chandler
chieftech714::nobody would take this trade and that contract. The amnesty exemption is our only weapon to free up cap space to attract some big names or at least a few young talented players. I like nique's comment. Kmart is beasting right now. He's fresh, lively, tough and can score. He is a much better companion piece to chandler than stats was. I like the guy but I think he's done here...
Nique_Olajuwon_Ew1ng::id rather have k-mart get those minutes in the playoffs
chieftech714::a win is a win. we are missing stats, the best center in the league hands down in chandler, wallace and thomas. We had to play small the entire night. As much I hate melo's ball hogging, he dominated the paint, the mid range and created scoring opps for everyone last night. this is melo at this best. Drawing doubles/triple teams and foul pls keeping the defense honest on the perimeter. Get chandler back and we will challenge miami.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I would've liked a few more assists from Melo and maybe a few less shot attempts, but I agree.  We can easily compete with MIA when healthy.  Win, maybe not so easy lol, but definitely not an easy out
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::yessir.  Can't wait until Tyson gets back to anchor the defense again.  I think the key to beating MIA will be Shumpert on D-Wade, and limiting MIA's low-key guys like Chalmers and Allen/Battier.  If Tyson can dominate in the paint, it should be a pretty even matchup.
chieftech714::JR smith coming off the bench and dropping 32 is the biggest story of the night to me. if melo feels like he can do a bit less, we might see some more assists. chandler is the key to our pick and roll. Can't wait to get this guy back and healthy. I think that miami is the champ but they won't be plowing through nyc. they are going to have to fight this team. Loving it.
bostonceltics344::Celtics next year starting lineup 1) Rondo                           2) Bradley                                        3) Green                                     4)  Garnett                                       5) Smith
sub1200::In the nba.... It really does not matter. The Knicks have as much of a chance of beating miami as boston does.... Zero.
Dengue-Fever::Finally someone with some sense..
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::if you believed that you wouldn't have to say it
AboutDatLife::Millions of Bostonians are loading up their lunch pales with lobster chips and warm Guinness and reading about their superiors from The Big Apple in the paper as they prepare to take on another 12-hour shift at the docks.
bostonceltics344::Give a lot of credit to knicks, the Celtics had 20 turnovers and Paul Pierce had 6 turnovers.
chieftech714::the knicks d forced a lot of those turnovers. Kidd is amazing at defensive pressure on the ball and the passing lanes.
hi haterss::I can't wait to see the old and dirty celtis as a number 8 seed so that way Miami Heat will destroy them again three time in a row. Old and dirty team deserves that.
Dengue-Fever::SORRY A$$ BUSTON!!!..
garnolfini::Celtics best matchup is against the Heat, that's why they're losing.
Donnie Walsh::Ryan Gomes, Donte Greene,  Hakim Warrick, Dominique Jones heck anyone with a heartbeat !! Cope looked like a drunk paraplegic last nite on defense &amp; offense!
Donnie Walsh::Still don't know why we're waiting on Sheed instead of adding another body with Kurt out for the season and Amare NOT coming back in any kind of game shape!
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Yikes.
Donnie Walsh::All in All - Amare will have missed 59 games this season !!
ThatsGoodSoup7963::How long has Amare been out? Seems like that guy can't stay on the court, year after year!
garnolfini::Who is out there to add at this point?
Road dog Red::lol.. we will find out QUICK
Donnie Walsh::TRUE  !!
Donnie Walsh::JR "OOOoooooowwwwwwweeeeeee" SMITH did'em in last nite!!! That was just downright CRUELTY to Old Folks with Pierce tryin to guard him !!
Road dog Red::There are laws against such actions... anyway JR Smith still resembles a chicken with its head cut off..... i wouldn't bank on him carrying the team... NEXT
Road dog Red::Positives from the game last nite: Shavlik Randolph got a rebound and a dunk
Road dog Red::a milestone in Celtic land
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Hahahaha.
Road dog Red::WHO????
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Mr. Jeff Green.
ThatsGoodSoup7963::And a Celtics player managed to get 10 rebounds.
Road dog Red::It was a good effort by the squad.. thing I've noticed most.. NO perimeter shooting... JJ reddick would have been a boon for them
jrtall3n7::Whenever Boston has a bad stretch people say they are done, but they are always proven wrong.
Road dog Red::They ain't done... but the oven is cooking them
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Looking bad lately.
Road dog Red::The Celts ain't limping into the playoffs... they are dragging both legs
Donnie Walsh::U forget ur on a NEW YORK BOARD so ur hoverin !!
Donnie Walsh::U Never know what could happen once ur in the Playoffs so.......
Road dog Red::... Hmmmm.. a new hoveround
Dengue-Fever::Buston Suuck!!!
Road dog Red::and you know a lot about sucking
88bryant18::Which team does more talking with less winning? Celtics or Lakers?
Road dog Red::LMAO... No one predicted the Celts to break records or win a championship this year.. thats the FAKERS
TreC1983::Celtics. One championship in the last 25 years...
Dengue-Fever::Garbage a$$ Buston!!!
hi haterss::I can't wait to see the old and dirty celtis as a number 8 seed so that way  Miami Heat will destroy them again three time in a row. Old and dirty team deserves that.
hi haterss::Like the last 2 seasons. lol. Idiot.
Donnie Walsh::@Mets-Jets-Knicks - Celts are the only team other than us that play The Cheats hard and manage to control the tempo. Miami depends on EZ baskets &amp; TOs - limit those and don't let LeHype get to the basket for braindead undefended Dunks and you beat the CHEATS and their weak fans !!!
Dengue-Fever::Both you are idiotS!!!!
Donnie Walsh::I don't believe Miami will destroy The Celts in a seven game series!
Mets-Jets-Knicks-Isles19::really? i think they would too
Mets-Jets-Knicks-Isles19::Things looked bleak on that road trip...nice to see we steadied the ship
Donnie Walsh::There's NOT one Team in The NBA that's been decimated by injuries more than the Knicks so STOP THE EXCUSES BOSTON FANS and man up &amp; take ur medicine !!
Donnie Walsh::Right Now its three and possibly four dependent upon how Melo's knee responds over the next two weeks !!
Donnie Walsh::The Knicks have had SIX STARTERS OUT with season ending and reoccuring injuries so ...... Amare, Sheed, Kurt Thomas &amp; Chandler were out of last nites game in case you forgot!!
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Nope, I didn't forget. How many Knicks players are out for the season?
ThatsGoodSoup7963::The Celtics and can make a case against that statement. The Celtics have 3 players out with season ending injuries.
TUMFCherryOwl::Im not surprised by the loss considering the celts are injury depleted and thin on the front. Its still no excuse losing to the knicks. They need to step it up. Then again im realistic and know the celtics arent even going to the finals let alone past the second round this year. I would lose the rest of the games this season and try to get the number one pick so we can win te title next year
Donnie Walsh::What title next year &amp; what #1 Pick is going to impact The Celts? Dreamin !!
NewYorkallday73::Knicks are pretty injury depleted also, so I'd say this could have went either way.  Went Knicks way tonight, let's see what happens back in MSG.  Go Knicks!  Hopefully the same thing.......
Road dog Red::LOL... and who would that number one pick be that can take them to the finals????
hi haterss::hi haterss .   I'm glad celtis sucks, dirty and old team can't win, I hope they lose every games reminded of the season.  KARMA.
TUMFCherryOwl::Im glad you hate the celtics, that means we're great for you to have hatred. At least the celts didn't break the bank on has beens like sheed, wife beater, kmart and ray fatton
hi haterss::Keep suffering , i can't wait to see your junk  team as a 8 seed to enjoy  one more time how Miami Heat is going to destroy your junk team  .
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Despite the grammatical errors, which I can navigate, this is still an idiotic post.
_I Am A Celtic_::Someone clearly didn't graduate high school
SRQisAlive::yo Red your Celts ain't got nothin on da knicks
Road dog Red::The Tics are stumbling into the playoffs... and its painful to watch
Road dog Red::Small ball doesn't work unless you have a Lebron James... cuz he's really a BIG
SRQisAlive::This game proves that the Knicks are going to da championship this year  we got melo
NewYorkallday73::I think he is just trying to rattle cages, as a a Knicks fan myself I would love to believe that to but that would take alot of work.
TUMFCherryOwl::A win over a injury depleted and struggling squad just barely making the playoffs means a championship? Are you on something? I guess a win over the sixers, who have one 1 game in the past 3 months must validate the knicks as title contenders
Road dog Red::KMAO... puh-leeeze/// the Chicks are going No where
Road dog Red::tSK tSK..... tHE sHIP bE sINKING
hi haterss::I'm glad celtis sucks, dirty and old team can't win, I hope they lose every games reminded of the season. KARMA.

Vermin_cain::If those Beantown raisins play every team with the same passion and urgency they play the Heat, they would be the best team in the NBA...
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Ouch. We got worked. Good game, NY, you owned us in our own building. Crap!
B..........::Good way to handle a loss. Nicely done.
Child_Prodigy1982::Melo's stats compare quite similar with Kobes career.
YoHongWhatUp::All except......rings.
