Wild Silverback::get em Suns !!!
Rene Covarrubias::hey bro do u think this game has a chance to go over 209?
Randy Ragsdale::Get ready for the blowby. Don't watch this game if you dislike cruelty to animals, because Bledsoe and Dragic are going deer hunting.
Derik Dolajeck::Udoh and Neal should not see the court.  They come in and the entire flow and energy is sucked out of the building.
