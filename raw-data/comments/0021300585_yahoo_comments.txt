me::I don't understand having a player like Boozer. On the surface he seems like a reasonable contributor, scoring a bit, rebounding pretty good, etc.  But what good is he if he is supposed to be one of your starting stars and he sits out the most important minutes when the game is on the line in the fourth quarter?  What this tells me is .....that he offers some skills that you think you need during the game, but those skills do not outweigh his negatives and when it comes to crunch time, you make the real decision about how you feel about the guy...that he is not one of your 5 best players.
Rick's Rockets::I think we are beginning to see Jimmy Butler's limitations.  He is not a lights out shooter, he can't create his own shot, and often drives to the basket a bit out of control.  His defense certainly saves his game.  But he doesn't have those absolute flashes of greatness that you need by your third season to show your on your way to an all-star game.  I would certainly use him in a trade this summer if the Bulls can make a sign and trade move on Lance Stephenson.
Flame::We're down 3, so how about we put Augustin in the game for the last shot? He's 4-6 from downtown!
ExPat::They are both 18-19. But if Nene can play 30 minutes or more and the Wizards guards shot 40% or better, the Bulls won't have much of a chance to win. It really will come down to which team plays better defense. I doubt Chicago can average 95%+ on FT again.
LeBlow Job James::Good job Bulls, the tanking continues. Well at least they didn't get hammered like the Flammers.
Amir::Are we going to lose against worst Bulls roster in history? Cant believe that Kirk worst NBA player is destroying us...
Mario::Augustin goes 4-5 and plays only 9 minutes ,I don't get it
Michael::Can we please let Beal play more than 30 minutes a night?
Hooch::One of these teams will be 500 when the nights over.
Mary::only one winner
