Reeves Cox::Let's go HAWKS! Beat the Magic!
Justin Wrasman::And cue another 5 years of magic dominance against the hawks. You guys had em for a couple seasons.
Reeves Cox::Ummmmm... No. They don't have their best player right now...
Cory Nope::Reeves Cox Uh....Jeff Teague suited up for that game....
Justin Wrasman::Ummmmmmmm......Who tears both of their pectorals? I don't think horford has played a full season to date and I think you lost your best player in the offseason.
Matt Greene::The thing is yall lost vs the magic with NELSON playing Point Guard haha  He cant even shoot the ball , his only points come off steals basically. If you ask any real basketball fan they will tell you the magic lost the championship to the lakers cause of him going into the lineup at the last minute even though it was Rafer alstons team all year. Nelson has poor defense no size speed or anything that gives off talent. He just can dribble and pass thats about it. He wouldnt be a bad backup PG though . For like cheap valuable minutes here and there. His contract is cheap next season too.
Cory Nope::Im a "real" basketball observer, and I think you have zero clue as to what youre talking about. They lost that series because they had no answer for Pau Gasol. Hedo cooled off, as well. Doesnt help that Phil Jackson outcoached Stan Van Gundy.
Trent Conheady::I don't like the hawks hopes going forward without Al Horford.
Bazooka Joe::WHERES MILSAP U FKIN MORON
Tony Hartmann::Nice win Magic!
