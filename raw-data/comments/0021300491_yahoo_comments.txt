Jon::I don't care what it does to Mr. Bennett's ego or how stupid it makes the front office look... Mr. Bennett needs to go play in the D League to get lots of playing time, get in shape, and rebuild his confidence!
usc2::My goodness.  Cleveland's scout who thought Bennett was worth the #1 pick should be fired immediately. Kwame Brown is now a happy man.
Jethro & Granny::Poor shooting NBA teams are painful to watch.   The Cleveland Cavs have been a "poor shooting team" since Lebron took his "talents" to Palm Beach (The Decision - ESPN).  Cleveland NBA fans have suffered enough, but the suffering continues.
Commenter::Garnett needs more rest days. Love guys like Evans that just go in there and work and rebound the basketball.
Lawrence::Please fire coach Brown tomorrow.He just cannot get the job done with the clowns he plays.
papi choulo::I stand behind Kidd. It's just a matter of time before he is vindicated.
Larry::The Cavs it's like watching a slow motion train wreck.
Kadak_Chai::jason kidd as a coach is a #$%$ slap to the face of all the good coaches
PKM::Last year Jarrett Jack was living in California and on a playoff team and now he is on Cleveland lol
Paul::Joe you need to score and rebound
