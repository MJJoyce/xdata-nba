RNYC::Get it together bobcats!
Zerrin74::Bobcats are gonna go 7-75 this season!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will Conroy.::I guess the Bobcats are only winning 7 games this year too.
phattybumbum::AAA Denver misses you.  Come back to us.

The Real Andre Herring::Bobcats need shooters to spread the floor. I think Henderson should shoot the 3 ball more to spread the floor and open it up more for Kemba. I know for certain MKG is gonna be working on his jumper and dribbling over the summer. Bobcats just need to get 20+ wins so the fans get to see some improvement. Also hope Biyombo works on his jumper over the summer a little but i'd rather see him work on that post game more. I also just have a feeling Mullens/Henderson/Thomas are all on the trading block at this point.
KarlosM76::Hey Dwight. The media will eat you alive in NY. Enjoy your free agency now that you have been exposed. All those things you got away with(no jump shot, free throw joke, no leadership, big sissy,) in Orlando will now be focused on.
kevininOKC67::I started using this betting system called Sportsbettingstar the past few months. I have made around 3K a month profits average using this system. If you search google for sports betting systems you will find the systems there. If you bet on sports you gotta check this out.
Hondo Kid::i wonder how much espn and their acountant make up every week.  this is tiresome bs spaqmbot nonsense.   u fin to get done fools.
KarlosM76::F a g
yohanzi213::Same old bobcats
MagicBoltzRays::Three stars: 1. Afflalo 2. Vucevic 3. Nelson
KevinOllieSaves::how long untill Kemba's a knicK?
mad2bee4::GO GATORS 11pt lead on ZONA !!!
Will Conroy.::Doh!!!!
delon10::I have to say that I am happy with Thiago Magic team. It's a lot more fun to see such an enffort from our guys than that Mr. Back stabbing Howard. And I love our coaching staff. Nice things coming our way in the future. Go Magic!
asdbluecfl::Yeah, the post game interviews with Vaughn are much more pleasent then Van Gundy's.
EnnBee15::But not nearly as entertaining!
Votto4mvp055045::hedo got hurt in home opener vs my nuggets i was watching that he got hurt in like the first minute broke his hand or something
delon10::Yeah, Broke his hand
supremekid912::I forgot the Magic had Hedo
TheCronoMasterMind::It's almost like we don't. He's played like one game this year, hasn't he?
Virgomused::Eghhhh, lakers .5 games behind magic...
mad2bee4::U late man, lol...
supremekid912::Magic have a better win percentage than the Lakers
mad2bee4::AN that said look how much roster AND coach turnover the Magic have had in last 10 months as well an how much better what MANY would say is far LESS talent  an what the Magic have did with it. This Magic team plays SO MUCH harder an together then the Lakers its not even funny...
mad2bee4::AN its not like this is after week one or 2 this going into now near the 1st 3rd of the season an IM so sick of hearing how the Lakers dont have nash b/c Magic still missing Hedo an Al(ALso missed nelson allmost half that time as well) an the Magic dont have KObe , Howard, MWP. an Pal to hold down the fort while those starters are out....
asdbluecfl::Yeah but our coaching staff and players have chemistry. Lakers are just a bunch of decorated overpaid nba big names, shoved together on one team.
mad2bee4::U beat me to it, I was bout to post samething, lol....
supremekid912::my bad lol
TCluvcarpanthers::MKG needed a lot more than 21 minutes. I think with him out there down the stretch; we win.
StompYourFace25::He needs to get out of foul trouble
jlwtdw359::yeah he's still a rookie it'll take him time to realize this
TCluvcarpanthers::He'll learn to give up on certain plays.
TheCronoMasterMind::I have to give the Bobcats credit. Kemba keeps playing games like this, they'll start knocking down some big wins. He just needs Henderson, Mullens, Sessions, and Biyombo to play well enough to balance out the team.
StompYourFace25::time to jump aboard the andrew wiggins train
marat 2.0::Vaughn is a much better coach that he was deemed before the hire, lol, or so it seems.
StompYourFace25::Same with Dunlap
asdbluecfl::Magic 10-13 Lakers 10-14. Looks like we made out pretty decent. And we got some cap space.
AGirlThatLovesSports_::keep your head up cats, the wins will come someday. let's pray before 2012 is over.
jlwtdw359::Wouldn't that be sad if the Lakers didn't make the playoffs
TCluvcarpanthers::We play the Lakers next.  Calling the 8th win now lol.
jlwtdw359::you know i just remembered we played them next looking forward to beating the LA Losers:P
TCluvcarpanthers::Ugh, great game Magic.   I'm disappointed; It is what it is though.
mad2bee4::I will say as magic fan that was a tough kick ball call at end....
jlwtdw359::Refs gave the game to Orlando when they called that idiotic kicked ball just my opinion
UCF knights 21::The only reason the game was close was because of the refs. Sorry.
jlwtdw359::i know but we still had a chance until that kicked ball foul and then all the air got sucked out of us
chris johnson 558::lol look at the fouls you took in the game bro
jlwtdw359::all the fouls in the game equals the 1 foul im talking about... how exactly does this work?
Edawg7115::Magic play the best team basketball with very little talent.     Take note Lakers we play TEAM ball
mad2bee4::A lot of teams should take note how this Magic team plays team ball...
TheCronoMasterMind::Good win tonight guys. Hopefully we can finally get a 3-game win streak against the wolves.
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::LA 10 - 14 MAGIC 10 - 13  GOTTA LOVE IT!!!!!
asdbluecfl::Good name.
allaboutthegators::Good game Charlotte... way better than last year... will enjoy watching you guys get better as we do as well
StompYourFace25::orlando has been playing a lot better than I thought without Dwight, surprised, and you too
Sir Gunner::I felt insulted, just a bit. Good performance MAGICS.
Sir Gunner::fuckbulshitowsdbhsobzwsour;oudhnrebgr;rzesburzh;bugrhez;bkjnzrdb
Edawg7115::we going to the finals ....................Magic vs San Antonio     4-0 Magic wins
pottedplants17::Test.
Sir Gunner::Corn-Sphere?
AtLeastWeDidntTradeForAndrewBynum::Execution down the stretch.................FLAWLESS!
pottedplants17::Pecovic!
StompYourFace25::Bobcats, offer Al Jefferson 4yr/52 million. We need a player that we can go to in the post in late game situations.  Make it happen.
Sir Gunner::Are we cursed? Can we ever get past 7 wins ?
pottedplants17::Testing.
bronbronsdad::bedtime kitties!
GOGETTA1MIL::VAUGHN COY???
pottedplants17::Kevin love is one of those maiz spheroid type of brothers.
TheCronoMasterMind::So he's not a deep-fried pickle?
Sir Gunner::Career high for Kemba
Sir Gunner::31 pts
Sir Gunner::Fc kin nelson
JDAnderson94::Baaad call.
TCluvcarpanthers::A KICK BALL?
Sir Gunner::Should of never been a kick.
Sir Gunner::Biz
JHCASHION88.6::The magic are doing surprisingly well for what they were left with after Dwight left. They are a good representation of what teamwork can achieve in overcoming adversity
Sir Gunner::Wow, the Cats are really great at keeping a lead -_-
Lantngz::lol if they were any good at keeping leads they wouldnt have lost 10 straight games bro
Sir Gunner::If "-_-" is added after a sentence, it implies sarcasm. ffs
