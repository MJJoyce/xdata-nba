9erballer::New Name Ideas: Toronto Unity Toronto Diversity Toronto Dot Toronto G20 Toronto Lights Toronto Triads Toronto Trife Toronto Calypso Toronto Caribana
LBLbrian00::Boston Strong !!!!!!
samdag2::Fab Melo - 17 minutes, 2 rebounds, 0 blocks, 4 fouls.  Ever since they drafted this bozo I cringe every time I hear his name mentioned.  Hopefully this stupid experiment is over and they'll cut bait with him next year.
nmpats4ever::Not that the C's are just going to turn on a switch come Saturday, and not that they have the depth and talent to go far, but let's be honest about the last month of their schedule:         (1) They were quite content on the number 7 seed after about mid-March, when it became evident they'd have to expend too much wear and tear to move up much. They seemed to do just enough to make sure they kept Milwaukee at 8, to avoid Miami in round 1.        (2) Garnet and Pierce needed all the time off they could afford in order to have the legs and health to even get through a single series.        (3) the loss of several players for the season to injury certainly impacted their second half strategy and depth       (4) the last month has given Jeff Green time to really find his offensive game, which they will need now.        (5) They have really played down to bad teams throughout the season, although on a number of occasions (perhaps not so much in the last month) have shown they are capable of playing close against the better opponents.     (6) Their road record has been dreadful, but this team has a few key vets who have proven an amazing ability to steal road playoff games in the past.
samdag2::Celtics vs. Knicks in rd one hinges on Garnett being at least 90% healthy, Pierce being able to do Pierce-like things, and the C's combined ability to keep the Knicks from getting offensive rebounds off missed 3's.
rondo2KG::I live in Boston, as you can tell by my name I am huge C's fan, and the this town is showing no love for the Cs at the moment.  No hype at all.  No one wants to see D-League line-ups for 3 weeks straight.
samdag2::They've been in rope-a-dope mode.  Was far more important that they enter the first round healthy than move up in seeding.  I have no doubt that the product they put on the floor in the playoffs will be far better than what they showed over the last month, but what remains to be seen is if they have the health necessary to sustain playoff intensity basketball over an entire series.
Dribbird.::They make not be focusing on the Celtics now.  They have been playing fairly meningless games the last few weeks.  But once the playoffs start, they will be in full hype mode.
_I Am A Celtic_::I agree with this but I sorta understand as well.  Obviously the media is focused on the tragedy that recently happened, but some the sports media is at least trying to get things back to normal.  Even still, they're not talking about the Celtics.  Seems strange
Who_watches_the_spurs::Celtics are absolute trash! They'd be 10th seed in the West. Knicks cake walk this series in 5 games or less.
_I Am A Celtic_::Meanie
GodofAcid::I think "slumping" only applies to teams that are actively trying to win
_I Am A Celtic_::Tumultuous season at best
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Embarrassing. I know this game was worthless, but ending the season with a W would have been WAY cooler!
ProjectPat88Kid::RRAPTORS RULE FCKIN RAPTORS COULD OF WON IT ALL THIS SEASON
VerdoGregory::Hey Boston, where's the love for Waco?
malkit32::OKC in 5... Lakers in 7... Nuggets in 6... Griz in 7.. Miami in 4.. Celtics in 7.. Indiana in 6.. and Chicago 7
malkit32::no its not!!! mine is raps wil be a playoff team if they upgrade at the pg positon man i watch their games a lot I dont think lowry can cut it.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::LAST COMMENT FOR THE RAPTORS SEASON IS MINE.  The guys we have now WANT to be in Toronto WANT to win in Toronto.  Lowry/DeRozan/Rudy/Amir/JV/Double A/TRossFlight31/Acy/Fields  WE READY, COME AT US, TDOT
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::DABU loves "="
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::I don't believe I am saying this. But Bear with me.  I am a Celtic----- I had to go do other things for the last half hour and I popped back in. This UK moron has made me want to root for the Celtics in the playoffs. You must literally have nothing to do tonight to stay here and debate this punk HAHAHAHA. Good on you man you gave the UK Virgin a thrill tonight. I got nothing but respect for you and go C's
_I Am A Celtic_::Best fight ever
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I'll "BEAR" with you. Great comment. Props on the virgin hit.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::I sent you a harsh message through the direct method but I take it back. You need my help. You can be my project. I have gotten 2 guys just like you, that are desperate for any type of attention laid through ESPN. I can get you laid guarenteed man. I have a ton of connections. Do it man. I know you are lonely I have been there. I grew up in NY, moved to Tor, went to Uni in Ark, worked in NO, spent 7 months in Dallas, have a sister that lives in B Town. I can hook you up.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Man, you're avoiding the obvious:  1. You troll 2. The Raptors have and will always sucks 3. You trolled all year. Don't act child
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Wha? I don't have Twitter man. Do you think I am someone else? I only have this one SN. Man this is the one time a punk like you gets lucky there is no one else on a board to punk you out becuz you clearly live and die on the ESPN boards. Dammit man. You are such an anonymous punk. I would chase you but within the next week you will be banned and will be under a different name. You are a such a Bi###. Your momma and daddy never smacked your face obviously.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Um, think I'm on a C's board and I'm clearly a C's fan. You're a troll. You've been a troll since day one and you know as much since you follow me on Twitter.   No, it doesn't matter that you are Gay. I was just correcting my comment. More power to you.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Nope been married and divorced as well becuz I couldn't quit. The trolling thing only works if you are on a board and you have no connection to the 2 teams playing......ooops that's you.  Seriously dude. I could get you laid man. Just give me a location. It would take so much stress off your mind  Edit: If I was Gay does that matter? Are you still living in the past when being Gay was taken as an insult haha. Man you really do need to get laid.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Correction: Man. You're clearly Gay
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Yet, here you are at late hours trolling. I bet you get laid regularly.  I've been married and divorced since the last time your felt the inside of a woman.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Let me guess you just blew your load? Man where do you live I guarantee I could get you laid. I have connections in every southern state.   Edit: No I am in pretty good shape. I have a pretty tough job so that gets rid of my excess fat. 6'3 217 right now.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Is Weight Watchers working well? Have you hit your target and avoided type 2 diabetes?
mason8181::Put the Celtics in the West... they miss the playoffs. They are pathetic. Boston sucks! Go Knicks!
mykal151::hes right.the Celtics are not a good team without Garnett. they have no back end defense, no height and no bench.Without Rondo too they have very little chance anyways.Hew a big time player.they aren't really more than what they are,a borderline playoff team at best.This idea of turning it off and on doesn't work in this case.Some of those bench guys they have no one else would want .Its out in the first round and see whats up next year.I dont see them having a chance against the knicks.they will win one game two games at best.Its time to face the real truth and rebuild with rondo and all else is a wild card.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::I wish you were here at the start of the game haha. C's fans can't seem to understand the Raps are taking their spot next year in the Top 8
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Put the Knicks in the playoffs in the west and you have the Nuggets minus the team atmosphere.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::If true=Lame, you're on target.
mason8181::Lame
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I'll tell you this much. If LBJ stomped on Pierce, you would be screaming at the top of your head.   Laettner on Timberlake: Fair call
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Aminu Timberlake: It was a Love Stomp
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::So as I understand it, you became a Duke fan right about the time of the SHOT? He should have been ejected and if he were black, he would have been gone.
_I Am A Celtic_::First game I ever watched was Duke vs LSU.  Can you guess who played for LSU back then?
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::BC the refs like white guys
_I Am A Celtic_::Very good and he got his butt whopped by Christian Laettner!!!
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Shaq?
Dribbird.::Shaq!
Dribbird.::http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/statistics/duke.html  All time UK vs Duke rivalry
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::UK with any coach besides the Alcoholic: contenders  Duke with any other coach besides Ratface: nothing
_I Am A Celtic_::Hey do they make NIT brackets?
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::And Happy BDay
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Good Grandpa.
_I Am A Celtic_::28 at the end of this month
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Not a stalker. Just a great memory.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::You're 28, right? Maybe older.
_I Am A Celtic_::I wasn't born prior to Coach K.  I started watching when I was 5
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::DJ: "Uh, No."
Dribbird.::They do.   Friars make the NIT on a good year.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I don't know. Did you watch prior to Coach K?
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I meant Sutton and Billy G
Dribbird.::Just to settle this argument.  Kentucky leads Duke in the all time series 11-9
_I Am A Celtic_::Stick to the Coach K era
Dribbird.::But Duke has won 7 of the last 8
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::He just signed up. Has no clue.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Until you recognize that UK owns Duke
_I Am A Celtic_::Robert Morris &gt; kensucky
_I Am A Celtic_::That doesn't even make sense.  Ryan Kelly is extremely important for Duke
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Ryan Kelly........................  I rest my case
_I Am A Celtic_::I can play the injury card as well.  Ryan Kelly was out vs Lehigh
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I can name the 1st player in the draft. You know him. He was missing from UK due to injury.
_I Am A Celtic_::Yea and Lehigh had a player that you could actually name.  An All-American even.  You can't tell me anyone who plays for Robert Morris
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Lehigh.
_I Am A Celtic_::Apparently didn't fill out a bracket this year.  Well let me fill you in.  UK wasn't in it
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Not really. Guess you're new to this.
_I Am A Celtic_::Big difference
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Lehigh? ReallY
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I'm getting your DJ account banned again.
_I Am A Celtic_::Get a life.  I'm going to bed
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Halloween.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::10/31. I rest my case.
_I Am A Celtic_::You
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::10/31? Who needs a life?
_I Am A Celtic_::http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6lijrx3Om1rssn1f.gif
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Not clicking
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Has Wiggins made a decision yet?
Dribbird.::We all know the Friars are better than UK and Duke anyway
Dribbird.::But last time Pitino walked through those doors he lost by 31.
_I Am A Celtic_::You talking baseball?  Lou Merloni ain't walking through that door
Sharmander12::I heard Wiggins is picking Carleton University.
_I Am A Celtic_::UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition - Has Wiggins made a decision yet?  He decided kentucky is gay
Sharmander12::Classy of Toronto to play Sweet Caroline during the Celtics intro. Tonight we were all Boston fans.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Where's the polar bear?
Dribbird.::I'm Surprised So Many Players Are Going To Kentucky   - Jabari Parker
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::That's due to my low SAT score #Jabari
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Please try to explain how Jabari Parker is better than AD and Noel. I'll wait.
_I Am A Celtic_::Let the kid play one minute at least
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::No. He's Shabazz.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::He's Shabazz or Rivers 2.0
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::AD &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nerlens Noel &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jabari
_I Am A Celtic_::I might just ban you myself
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::It makes me happy.
_I Am A Celtic_::Banning me is futile
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I'll get you back because you'll be playing homer if you think otherwise.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Yep. You're not responding to this one.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Doron Lamb &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jabari Parker
_I Am A Celtic_::Flag yourself for this comment.  I wouldn't even be surprised if you get banned.  ESPN loves Parker
_I Am A Celtic_::That too
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::ESPN loves UK.
_I Am A Celtic_::hahahaha IDIOT
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::WE could use Doron Lamb for 500K a year.
_I Am A Celtic_::Have you seen what JJ has been up to?  We could desperately use him
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Says the Redick homer
Dribbird.::Idk, Jabari Parker is a beast.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Dribbird.::Celtics!
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::C's
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Current troll count:  Lakers board: 356  C's board: 2
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::@stupid UK troll that tricked me into responding to him.HAHAHAHAHA. Any shot from more than a foot away from the rim is an adventure for Blake. That is not a good PF.  Amir Johnson a guy that no one would have ever thought could expand his game is 19-27 from 15 feet and out since March 1st.  B.Griff is so far down the list of PFs it isn't even funny. If he didnt have CP3 the best shot creator/oop thrower in the NBA he would be useless.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::And how stupid can I be if I tricked you Mensa?
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I don't care about BG. Josh Smith under Doc will be one of the best PF's in the game.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::and Celtsfan
_I Am A Celtic_::In fact, I'm also pauleena and Dribbird.  As well as JD
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::They make intelligent comments
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::No
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::DJ is Xiu Lu
_I Am A Celtic_::Yup
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::It's you or PPownsRondo
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Josh Smith can be the second best PF in the game.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Wha??? Do you even watch basketball? What would give you the indication that JS could be the 2nd best PF in the game? By your logic the best PF in the game is Blake Griffen.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Mag but replace the M with a F
_I Am A Celtic_::I like this Raptors fan
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I do. And Under the correct coaching, Josh Smith can own.
_I Am A Celtic_::Go to bed
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Thank you I am a Celtic. This guy is one of those trolls that can type haha
_I Am A Celtic_::It is way past my bedtime
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Go dream of KYRIE
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::You need to go to bed.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::So, can we beat the crappy Knicks?
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::We are getting Josh Smith. Mark my words. PP is retiring. JET needs to retire but will probably want the money.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Do you even watch Josh Smith? He is the farthest thing from what the Celtics need. A PF that is allergic to defence and relies on strength to get buckets. When your team is designed to run he would be useless. Plus no matter how much KG sucks Boston management will still believe he is any good so they won't bring in a guy that will take his job. Man you are really dumb, I am sure you are smart in other areas but sports aren't one of them.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I'm not going to argue with you. You can't even comprehend that UK has the #1 class in 15 years in CB.
Baby Usain Bolt::Sup UK
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Igg?
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::GL with the Spurs? I think.
Baby Usain Bolt::Well I'm out, goodluck with the Knicks.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Okay. You are not my worst enemy anymore.
Baby Usain Bolt::Okay, just making sure. I went by Boston like 3 weeks ago. I was on a internship in NY for the last couple months. Sucks man.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::My Boston fam lives in SF now but pray for others.
Baby Usain Bolt::Hey man, hope your Boston fam is alright
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I hate you.
Baby Usain Bolt::nope, your worst enemy
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::So, the Bengals are not getting James Harrison. Screw you Harrison. you suck.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::If I were the FBI and some form of attack occurred, I would examine ESPN sports boards first. Lots of sociopaths here.
dwightmare 2 the sequel::The Knicks are going to get swept....
Baby Usain Bolt::What a garbage team,,,  #PrayforCeltics
dwightmare 2 the sequel::Go Celtics....win for the victims
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::You're a sad man/woman in life.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::DJ, thoughts on Josh Smith?
_I Am A Celtic_::Not gonna happen
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::ARE YOU CRAZY?
_I Am A Celtic_::Oh boy
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Look who it is. Hope you and your family were safe.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Good to hear DJ. I know that's a big event. Happy to hear you're okay.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Well he lives in Boston. ST  fu
_I Am A Celtic_::Thanks for asking.  The fam is all good.  They all live about an hour out of the city.  I'm the only one who actually lives in Boston
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::76 of the injured were from countries other than USA.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::But don't like my idiot comments
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Post the playoff game conversation fools
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I can't believe someone said Uk is going to suck next year. Come on man. Keep up with the news.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Haha really? Who is swooping in to save the program? Even if you get Wiggans (which you won't becuz he understands that UK is going to blow goats, he is a Kid that went of school in Canada not the southern USA) All your major problems will not be fixed. For F sakes you missed the tourney this year HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::LIke I said, you're an idiot.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::How come you can't answer my question? UK has no one coming that will push you into the tourney.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::You really don't have a clue. Thanks for proving it.
