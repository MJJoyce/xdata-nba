Lamont::Everytime the Pacers win, Heat fans and heat bandwagoneers come on the blog to hate. Talk #$%$ about the schedule, the past, or whatever. My question is why? Yes you beat the Pacers twice in the playoffs but you act like it was easy. The Pacers have never really had a good regular season. They're trying to change that this year. I m not saying that its a rap, Pacers beating the Heat but the Heat shouldn't take them lightly. To me it sounds like a lot of heat fans/bandwagoneers are worried.
Kadak_Chai::Great game by the Pacers! Lance had a few nasty plays. George had that nice "gilbert, I made the shot i'm going to celebrate before the shot goes in arenas" shot. Hibbert was blocking like he was an offensive linemen. Rest of the crew also played well. Indy is back on the map !!
Dogtrainer7::I hope the Pacers stay healthy and keep this level of defense all season and playoffs. I don`t think we`re gonna see a seventh game loss to Miami this season not with all the newly acquired depth and the intense D
SCOTT LEHMAN::This is a good resting period. 3 days off then the Bucks...
Be+::I'll be very surprised if this is not another win for the Pacers.
Jun::Pacers will set a new record of the most lopsided win ever.  Win by 100 points.
Thomas M::How does a 7 2 big man not even average 10 a game and shoot 46 percent? good lord Hibbert
Ripple2803::Now that George is a legit superstar I don't see Miami beating them.
it is what it is::Pacers by 10+ tonight.  The Bucks become "notch" number 9.
Rico M::Deer in the headlights look for the Bucks when the Pacers come their way!
