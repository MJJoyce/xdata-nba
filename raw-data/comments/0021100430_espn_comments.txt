91Gmoney9009::http://games.espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=7twxxow  Would love this trade
GeX.::boop
nba is the worst::Jameer had 14 assists?  Twilight zone...
NickBrandes::I wish the magic would just trade Howard already, get a draft pick, get a good player, tank the rest of the season, have 2 first rounders, 2 second rounders, and start rebuilding this team.  It needs to be done.
Cool Sun 13::What do y'all think of this trade?     http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=7d5fq4m    Howard can play PF and Chandler stays at C. While the Magic gets a lot of value in return for Dwight.
t-roy_jenkins::no one wants amare!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool Sun 13::I didn't say draft picks weren't involved, the Knicks also send a 1st rounder to Orlando. Orlando with Stoudamire at PF/C can draft a Center with the pick.
NickBrandes::They need to get a draft pick to.  I like it, but without getting a draft pick where they can have a chance to get a big man, they are giving up too much.
conlevis2::Howard's post game is a JOKE.  take away all of his offensive fouls that weren't called and every single time he travelled that they didn't call and he'd have 6 points
Magicmike321::Is that why you want him on your team?  GTFOH
DEEP1223::Is Ryan Anderson as go as Jeremy Lin or the media just blowing the kid up.He may be good but lets just give him time 7 games don't make you HOF..
the702shogun::i want dwight, a pure scorer, a point guard that taller than me &amp; jameer nelson, and the rest  shooters lighting it up from everywhere
the702shogun::refreshing to see the magic finally playing decent basketball. that stuff they were passing off as basketball before the heat win, was border line, nay, it was 100% pure unadulterated poo poo in the middle of the living room carpet. unacceptable  i've been down this road before and i've seen the prequel &amp; sequel, otis still go find me a point guard and a pure scorer that can play some D.
Chris31708::To all the people saying the 76ers were gonna shut the Magic down again...  The Magic's defense has gotten better since their last meeting, that's why the Magic shut them down tonight and made it look easy.
salemram15::Giving up a double digit lead on 2 different occasions in the game is “making it look easy”? Whatever you say bro…
salemram15::Exactly, ORL was the better team tonight and earned that win. What I'm saying is it didnt look easy. A 17 point lead dwindled down to a 4 point game. During that run the Magic couldn’t get a stop to save their lives. The Defense was getting walked on and the offense virtually disappeared through that stretch.The game nearly slipped out of their hands. At that point ORL was desperate for a stop and/or a bucket. Thats making it look easy? Granted the Magic did end up regaining control, but it was anything but easy.  bro
Chris31708::And the Magic built the lead right back up, notice the 76ers never lead in the game right? The Magic were in complete control throughout. The 76ers pretty much gave up at the end, while the Magic didn't when they could've just took the double digit loss the first time they faced off.  Bro.

bigdickjim::76's suck.
RZA_CONSOLE::philly is still the better team come playoff time - much more  team dynamic  if philly got Kemba as a real PG and Mcgee from the wizards    i'd lose lou williams. keep jrue
salemram15::I'd rather have Lou then Kemba. His numbers are better then Kemba's in pretty much every statistical category. Very similar players, but i have to give the edge to Lou.
MikeyWelsch::Jameer with double digit assists? What is it a full moon tonight?
TheCronoMasterMind::Davis has been anything but stellar the past few games, though his father just passing on Sunday, I supposed he should be cut some slack. I'm thinking Clark will be getting some minutes after today, since Davis will be gone to spend time with his family. Hope things are alright for him at home. Anyway, onto the next game for the Magic.
DirkNowitzki4President::Mavs vs Philly on Friday  Dwight Howard to the Mavs Summer 2012
salemram15::Should be a good one, bring your running shoes...
MagicBoltzRays::More Earl Clark.... Less Fat Baby.
MagicBoltzRays::If the Magic traded anderson that means Fat Baby would be a starter.... *Shudders*
dgm215::but after tonight and seeing Anderson for the first time in the flesh ball, if yous wanna trade him I'm all for it!  Big mofo that can shoot like that.... thats somethin special
taylorh19::Don't under-estimate the logic of Otis Smith.  Anything is possible.
dgm215::id doubt ur team ever would ever be dumb enough to do that though
Orlandomagic2323::Jameer decided to show tonight. Good shooting and 14 assists!
Chris31708::The team is fully healthy again. They weren't healthy a month ago.
dgm215::not a $@%!$@ vin diesel character
dgm215::yeah.... i always f up his name
dgm215::i'd say him and Riddick are the bait now too... i'd take either or.... especially R
MagicBoltzRays::you mean Redick?
dgm215::St. Joe's Baby!!!!!
MagicBoltzRays::How did Bosh make the All Star game over Anderson anyway?
salemram15::Bosh is actually having a pretty solid season. Not to say Anderson isn’t all-star worthy, but Bosh deserves a spot on the team as well.
Chris31708::He plays for the Miami Heat, any other ?
gdfgdfgfdgdfgfdg::Ryan Anderson for all star ballot
taylorh19::Trading Anderson would be a horrible move.
Orlandomagic2323::to go along with dwight howard*
Orlandomagic2323::Need some physical players or an actual "Big" man.
Orlandomagic2323::True I love Anderson but is he anything but trade bait now? He could be a key trade piece to getting somebody esle down here.
MagicBoltzRays::How can you trade Anderson? He's far to valuable. If anyone is trade bait it's probably Redick.
dgm215::it wasn't even just him though and the 6ers are supposed to be the best against gaurding the 3 in the league?!  I know Dwight deserves an $@% load of attention and respect... but that was just embarassing.  Especially when it mattered most!
MagicBoltzRays::Anderson was considered to be a "throw in" with the Vince Carter deal two years ago. that isn't the case so much now.
dgm215::that was ridiculous... and here he ... what, broke some record the night before on 3's and we let him kill us like that.  Apparently we didn't get the game film!  Christ's sake.....
MagicBoltzRays::It's called "pick your poison" Double Dwight and leave anderson open, or single cover him, and let him make easy baskets.
dgm215::tell your championship theory to the St. Louis  Card and the N.Y. Giants.... certainly no one else not rated first in a conferance can win a Trophy!
dgm215::If it's that f'n easy and there has never been upsets in the history of the NBA....
dgm215::SO WHO'S GONNA WIN THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP!?
AIadvocate::NBA is totally different than MLB and NFL.
dgm215::of course the number 1s can win a f'n championship.... but in most cases lately... THEY HAVENT!  Trust me, I'm a Phillies fan!
CmonPhilly::Don't forget last year's SB winners the Packers.
unNOOBable::uhh.. 7-10 threes for anderson? hes the only reason howard would wanna stick with that team.
MagicBoltzRays::how about a 12/14 night for nelson?
Do The Zombie Stomp::J.R Smith to the Magic he would get a ton of minutes / Hedo and J-Rich only played 20 minutes a piece tonite and J-Rich sat out the entire 4th Quarter last game, Make it happen Otis it would be the 1st step in showing Dwight your willing to spend money to bring in help.
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::However, the Magic are the biggest frauds of all out of the bunch.
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::East Playoff Picture outside of Chicago and Miami  Hawks, Pacers, Sixers, Magic = Frauds Celtics = still dangerous no matter where they get seeded in the playoffs Knicks = still currently frauds, more potential than the aforementioned frauds though.  Signed,   Realistic Hawks Fan
MirBay_Watson::The nerve of ANYONE saying a team is frauds that is an ADMITTED Hawks fan.  Sixers kicked the shi-t out of that worthless franchise TWICE this season, along with the Pacers, Magic, and Bulls. Stay focused on StagLanta, those posers in Hawks jerseys, and Joe Johnson robbing the team blind.
dgm215::had our $@%!$ kicked by miami twice, but bulls aint $@%!.... and Rose is hurt.  Thinks again man....  thats why wild card have been winning the last 2 PRO SPORTS CHAMPIONSHIPS!!!!!!!!!!
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::Yeah, I think i'll go by their stellar play this year, plus the potential of D12 not even being with the team come playoff time. Give it a rest dude, the Magic are FRAUDS.
Chris31708::Sure, <b>everyone</b> that isn't a Magic fan is saying Howard is gone, we get it.
Chris31708::The Magic aren't "frauds" bro, don't let last year fool you, they've had more playoff success in the last 4 years than your Hawks have.
salemram15::Are you blind? He isnt defending his team, he listed them as frauds as well.
dgm215::whatever... good game.  till the last 2 minutes at least.  seeing yous in the playoffs regardless..... in all likely hood
dgm215::knock on wood
MagicBoltzRays::LMFAO. the pistons won @ Boston. Cleveland beat the pacers, and Phoenix is beating the Hawks at half.
Chris31708::Here's what people were saying a month ago:  "Howard needs to leave Orlando he has no help."  Howard actually has more help this year than he did last year, last year his PPG average was 22.9, his usual regular season PPG average is between 19.0 and 21.0. The 2nd scoring option on the Magic last year entering the playoffs only averaged <b>14</b> PPG, the Magic were a 1 man show a year ago.
MagicBoltzRays::I had to sit in front of the hedo fan crowd tonight. that sucked.
dgm215::what team u root for... or are you just on LIN's CO(K LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD!?!?  PROB DONT EVEN HAVE A REAL HOME TEAM.... POSER
dgm215::congrats!  now go home and fu(k your sleeve
dgm215::Or a mentally handicapped kicks fan who always find their way onto Philly sites after their teams have won.... the last 6 games!
super_lintendo_101::PHILLY IS OVERATED
Jganon93::im sorry we cant win every game for you?
drose chokes crys in lockeroom::Every year ESPN Finds a Poster Boy... Lin gets the honor this year.. atleast I don't have to hear about $@%!$@% blake griffin!
DTangMF::I just hope we beat the $@%! out of Celtics next game.
MagicBoltzRays::FACT: when Jameer plays well, the magic are nearly impossible to beat.
DTangMF::When Turk plays well, Magic are hard to beat also...
Chris31708::Hey now, he helped get the Magic to the '09 Finals.
MagicBoltzRays::fu<b></b>ck turk. he sucks.
dgm215::LIN is the Man.... chinese superman!
dgm215::except for my ZERO POINT ZERO!!!!
dgm215::college was the best year of my life :)  West Chester... the guy are outnumber 9-1 with hot $@% $@%!$@%.... and my roomate sold Kind-bud.......   AWESOME!
Heat8Championships::Hes american
dgm215::well i know what u mean... he is american.  went to harvard for christ's sake.... but of asain ancestry is what i meant
dgm215::nah hes chines or tawain... right?  definitely asain... thats for sure
dgm215::that $@%! is gettin kinda played out on ESPN though.....  even thought its still unbelievable at the same time!  I don't wanna be a NBA player i just wish i had the 3.5 GPA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Heat8Championships::HEAT!
Frank Reynolds 5::That game just sucked for the Sixers
SeanMurph25::Honestly, I want the Sixers to have a good season but more than anything I want Lebrons fingers to stay ringless...which they will if he tries to pass his way to a ring like he did last postseason. The real King has the name BRYANT on his back.
openminded43::The F'd UP schedule is going to screw with every team!!!
SeanMurph25::the rest of the team needs to take notes from Louis and rise up. He cant do it on his own.
dgm215::agreed.  they got raped in 3 point percentage... BAD
Frank Reynolds 5::Yes the 3 pointers killed them. They just have to play harder next game and get a win
MeloIsTrash::Mets suck
SeanMurph25::Maybe the Boston SuxCox but not the Yankees, keep dreaming.
openminded43::The Rays are 7 deep in starting Pitching!!! Surprised they didn't trade one!!!
SeanMurph25::the Mets are the forgotten step-child of New York.....Go Yankees!! Enjoy the backseat Mets.
openminded43::Rays will BEAT the Yankees and Red Sox!!!
openminded43::The Mets are a TOTAL EMBARRASSMENT!!!
dgm215::you know im gonna say they fu(k!n suck!
JulioJonesBrother::Even the Bobcats think the Mets suck.
openminded43::Sure do!!!
openminded43::Even us Mets fans admit that!!!
Cubs_Fan0523::At least the Celtics are losing... Philly will still have a 4 game lead in the worst division in the NBA.
dgm215::Just make sure you have all the $@%! ready for spring training down in Clearwater.... tickets to Phills vs. Yanks!
dgm215::heating bills do suck balls!  we are actually it hasnt been to cold up here yet (KNOCKING ON A GIGANTIC PIECE OF F'N WOOD!)
dgm215::*actually having it good so far because it hasnt been too cold up here yet (KNOCKING ON A GIGANTIC PIECE OF F'N WOOD!)
openminded43::No, heating cost more!!!
openminded43::No, heating cost more!!!
dgm215::Ehhhhh..........  I HOPE YOUR ELECTRICITY BILL IS THROUGH THE ROOF!!!!!!!!!
openminded43::Just flicked it off, it was warm in here!!!
openminded43::Clearwater isn't down..... it's to the west!!!
openminded43::I have my AC on!!!
dgm215::im saying down as in a general direction from the state of Pennsylvania taking a plane DOWN there to your state.  Sorry about the nautical miscues.....
SeanMurph25::Lou Williams 6th Man of the Year. I went to middle and high school with him and I can honestly say he puts more effort into every game then Lebron ever will. Keep watching, he's getting more comfortable in the league every year.
SeanMurph25::Because he talked too much about rings before he's ever gotten one. And his lack of intensity of the playoffs, trying to pass his way to history. Kobe takes the driver seat, Lebron rides in the back.
mawright04::lol y it gotta always be about lebron smh
JulioJonesBrother::Oh lol. He went to South a couple years before Lou, he's the basketball coach at Duluth now.
SeanMurph25::cant say that i do
JulioJonesBrother::Do yuo know an "Eddie Hood"?
SeanMurph25::Duluth= joke. haha
SeanMurph25::youtube "south gwinnett vs. oak hill 2005".....one of the greatest high school games of all time, featuring the man himself Lou Williams, Kevin Durant, Ty Lawson, Mike Mercer, and other notable players.
dgm215::he'll def be one of the top contenders!!!!!
JulioJonesBrother::Duluth&gt;South Gwinnett
SeanMurph25::damn right!
JulioJonesBrother::South Gwinnett!
Cubs_Fan0523::Well congrats Magic fans... and you'll probably get to see these highlights on Sports Center for a minute or two between Jeremy Lin documentaries.
openminded43::Magic WINS get pushed back regardless!!! When they LOSE, it's FRONT STORY!!!
openminded43::Plus they want to put them in a darker light because they WANT Dwight across from their NEW NBA Studio!!!
Chris31708::ESPN still hates the Magic for ruining the Lakers/Cavs dream matchup in '09.
JulioJonesBrother::Hahahahahahahahaha Dwight is leaving you
eessbb12::DWIGHT IS LEAVING ORLANDO AND WILL SUCK. PC
openminded43::And YOU hang your hat on that.......WHY???
picaac15::Predictions to when Lin-capable ends..  I say lose to Mavericks by 12 - Lin scores 12 Then it's truly over when Lebron dunks on his face and wins by 22.
DTangMF::Lin will be guarded by either Wade or Lebron, he will struggle, but that just proves that he is a treat.
MagicBoltzRays::Stan being pretty hard on Anderson. Because of a lack of rebounding
venerican1::honestly the only player that hasn't been playing as well as he usually does, during this magic run, is howard.
venerican1::i didn't say D12 is playing like crap. but he did get outplayed by zaza pachulia, drew gooden, and the timberwolves center i forgot his name. he could do better.
openminded43::Like they play him straight up???
eessbb12::EVERYONE DOES BETTER B/C DEFENSES FOCUS SO MUCH ON DWIGHT. COMPREHEND THAT?
TheCronoMasterMind::As much as I don't want to agree, to an extent I have to. The only difference is that when Howard wasn't on the floor in the games they've won this month, the team had fantastic ball movement, sunk the shots(usually 3s, which Howard doesn't take), and even got points in the paint. Yes he is crucial to the team, but not entirely necessary.
ChicagoSportsFTW8510::screw the fantasy stats.  His team is more active and playing well
eessbb12::LOL YOU DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT BBALL DO YOU?
Masta Da Magician::I still find it hard to believe that Dwight will just walk away from 30 million dollars..No body walks away from 30 million dollars I don't give a f*ck who you are.
flexdafunk::and get raped by New York State taxes on everything.
_MagiCanes_::With another top 5 player in Wade and all star Bosh. Deron and a bunch of scrubs will be nothing with Dwight.
Dr. Desk Desk::Lebron did
Dr. Desk Desk::Oh I got you, I totally forgot about that.
Masta Da Magician::It's the way the new CBA is set up..A players original team can offer him as much as 30 million more than any other team.. It's a new clause they put in to help teams keep their stars..I guess we'll find out soon if it works.. Now if the Magic trade Dwight before the deadline then the team he's traded to can pay him that much..  But if the Magic don't trade Dwight he'll be leaving 30 million dollars on the table if he leaves this summer.
Dr. Desk Desk::You sure? I heard they had the much salary space. How much were they offering? I don't remember
Masta Da Magician::Lebron didn't walk away from that much... The new CBA made it so players would be walking away from more money now by leaving their teams.
Do The Zombie Stomp::Havnt you heard these so called experts say its more like 3 dollars
dgm215::thats almost enough for that TACO BELL deal!!!!!
venerican1::and to go to the mighty powerhouse of the NBA...nets....
_MagiCanes_::That was Dwight frustrated in himself about missing easy shots. You miss took what he meant.
TheCronoMasterMind::lol. If the Magic keep playing like this, I doubt Howard will leave. Granted, he did just say the other day that he wanted to be the one making big plays. Almost sounds like he is jealous that Anderson and Richardson are getting so much attention lately. He's pulling a Kobe right now.
_MagiCanes_::And start over.
