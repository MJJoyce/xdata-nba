H7N7::you know the Clippers are relevant when the Laker fans come on here talking #$%$... they seem intimidated
Rodney::Just another day at the office for your division leading Clips.
NBAs Greatest Coach::Its time for the Clips to turn to the corner.  They are really not playing well.
LobCityFan::.333 Pct. Really. That is what you are bringing to the table against the Clippers tonight? Teams do sometimes struggle on the road, especially 7 game road trips. So what is the excuse for 76er's performance this year?
Commenter::Laker trolls are in their holes hiding.. Must be the beating from last night and clips win today
NBAs Greatest Coach::Thats more like it Lob City.
Rodney::Lob City Baby!  Bring it on home.
J::Look at all the Laker fans here after what happened to the mamba last night.
Clipperdude::Clippers need to not  be a jump shooting team right now with Redick out. At least quit throwing up 3's,
HIP2CLIP::Griffin...best passing big man in the game
