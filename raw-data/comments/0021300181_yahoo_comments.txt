Cyril::The amazing thing about the NBA is how good players can fall through the cracks in the wrong systems.  Koufos had a good rookie season in Utah, but then he was practically forgotten for two years.  Before going to Denver, he was on the verge of heading overseas.  A year later he was the starting center on the team with the 3rd-best record, and now he's a very good backup carving out minutes behind a top 5 center.   Meanwhile, the Knicks still have Chris Smith.  Oh well.
Ngoo Nam::Looks like the Spurs want homecourt advantage all through the playoffs.  Looks like they want another set of rings.
Commenter::I expect SA to be in the finals again, they play organized ball.
oldsecretary::A few years ago Dwyane Wade took a reduction in salary to help his team land LaBron.  Last year Tim Duncan took a 50% salary cut to keep the Spurs together.  Wade got his reward in two more rings.  I hope this year Duncan gets his just reward.
PKM::Should be a good game.
sda::Spurs just keep on rolling
ryan::spurs are going all the way this year
donald::Conley is an All-Star but they really miss Marc against the Spurs, cause Zach can't do his thing against them anymore.
N::Wow SA still rolling will have a tougher road to the finals as OKC has Westbrook back and Houston has a interior defense..   Going to be a great year for the NBA as the Heat is the class of the East but look at Indiana wow
Patrick::I love how they say for the most part their old but they still kick #$%$ Go Spurs.
