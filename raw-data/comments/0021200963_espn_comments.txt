teach2002::these guys suck... and that's no "bull"
DodgersRaidersBullsFresnoState::I ended up going to this game. Off night for Chicago. We'll get them back in the playoffs. Oh wait..
Kpmg allstar::So um... Without DMC, Kings are good.
Then He Made Us Pancakes.... Pancakes.::Well, at least they didnt lose by 43
MannyT89::Duh Bulls
Cameron46500::Bulls got branded last night. Period.
unitedfourlife::now if only the kings can play like that night in and night out!!  :\
fsdf5316::Guess this proves once and for all that Derrick Rose can't win a ring with this squad.  Everyone will know to double him because the Bulls don't have other go-to scorers that can average more than 20ppg.  Should have shopped Deng, Noah and Boozer more
DatGuy8921::No keep Noah.
ScalabrineSwag::does it get any lower than this? come on bulls. i watch every game...i will continue to watch every game no matter how we are playing but still this was painful.
unitedfourlife::try being a kings fan!
Phatepiclewts::9.5% from 3 lmao
Bevente::It's crazy how after all of this, the bulls are still 5th in the east.  They're in a very odd position.  If they continue to slide, they'll face a likely first round exit against Indiana or Miami (if Rose is still out), but they can't slide enough to miss the playoffs and take a chance of getting a good lottery pick b/c of how awful everyone in the east below the 8th seed is.  The only likely chance for success this season is a rose return and first round play against either the nets or hawks (as of right now, it's the nets, which is cool with me).
pap6919::Man d rose is all over the bulls conversations. Why hes not ready! Loul deng is playing like garbage. noah since d howard owned his $@%  cant score over 10 pts.  These guys are pros and are getting star money and are producing like bench players I think that Reggie rose comments screwed this team up. Call it what you want but this team has folded. Until rose comes back they will not try for thibs. Thibs has lost the team. Thanks Regg
JCDish::Funny how C Booz has a good scoring game, and the Bulls lose. Good job Booz.
JCDish::These Bulls must be reeling after hearing that DRose is struggling with his bball confidence. But to lose by 40 to the Kings, WOW.
BoWendy McHardie Bugers::It wouldnt be like this if rose was healthy an playing but i wouldnt bring him back out untl next season when he's fully recovered
NNVBcoach::No excuse for any pro team to be down by 14 points at the end of  the 1st quarter!
Lebroncouldcareless::ONLY BOARD WITH 5000+COMMENTS  HEEEEEEEAAAAAAATTTTT!!!!!!!!!
Lebroncouldcareless::DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNN!!!  -LEBRON
Thomas31::This team should be embarrassed.  Why would DRose come back if these guys show no fight?  Thibs needs to start coaching now.  It was easy when you had DRose, but now he needs to start actually coaching these players....  BULLS
tigel18::This was our year... to secure a lottery pick.  Damn it!!!
Lebroncouldcareless::damn! lol  -lebron
IlyaKol::Can people stop talking about the East sucking REAL bad? They are worse than the west by a small margin, but it isn't a gaping hole.  None of the east playoff teams are below .500 and only one team in the west is out of the playoffs that is .500+.  There are more teams at the top of the west, but 5-8 is no better than any team not named Miami in the east.
ThunderHornz::D1ROSE DA BULLS - bulls 105-73
ThunderHornz::Dang, Kings! Nice work!
kool aid 098::why are we losing to the queens... this is pathetic, a loss is bad enough, but by 40 points?!?!?
unitedfourlife::queens huh, says the bills fan who got a beating last night.
Phatepiclewts::It's easy to crap all over a team when they shoot 38% and 9.5% 3-pointers and give up 17 turnovers.
jimmy188710::Now this is funny
yardog59::Face it folks, this simply isn't a very good team!
rondo2KG::Next five or 6 games will be tough - -GS, Denver, Pacer, Portland, Twolves (Meh), Miami.    Step it up Bulls.
IlyaKol::They might lose ALL of those games.
01Bulls4life::Wow, Kings defense ranks 30th in the league and the Bulls horrendous offense made the Kings Defense Look Super Great. Even Thib's is confused!
Anthony85208::PSHS_football - Blown out by the Kings, what a joke.    On the other hand, this Derrick Rose situation is just purely pathetic.  He needs to grow a pair of balls and earn the money they're paying him.  We all know he's dumb as a rock, literally... but c'mon, does he not realize starting to play LIMITED minutes is part of the rehab process.  Not to mention another point overlooked is he needs all the playoff experience he can get... most championship teams are built off playoff failures.  Who does he think he is?  I'm living in Afghanistan in rat infested tents with the possibility of an insurgent attack every night getting paid about $2800/month, yes I signed up for this but point is he needs to stop being a $@%!$@% drama queen.  He has already been told he is literally at no higher risk than any other player in the NBA of injuring himself.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I hate it when people compare the military to any professional sport. As sad as it sounds, there are a lot more people that can fill in for a soldier than can fill in for one of the best players in a professional sport.  Even sadder is the fact that his legs alone are worth more than a soldier theoretically. Sorry 2800/month to the 16 million dollars of salary cap space that Rose takes up, kind of doesn't compare. Even I have been skeptical of Rose, but the fact remains that he's so close to playing right now, he doesn't want it to happen again, because if it does, he'll get that "injury prone" tag put on him. Personally I have been trying to turn a blind eye to this Bulls team recently, and just wait for Rose and the other injured players to return. All the injuries are just killing us. The fact that we can even compete, barring last night, is getting ridiculous.
lovestephon23::With rose at ten minutes a game the bulls still Loos he can't help this team this year next year

osogood729::some of you people need to grow up. at ease with the personal attacks. you signed up for those living conditions. suck it up.
Greekniko21::The Eastern Conference is really bad right now.
Phatepiclewts::The Bulls will be nasty with Derrick Rose back. And the Pacers are pretty solid at full strength.
saucyminxbaby::Knicks are about to start free falling with the Bulls.
This_Guy1::I'm tearing up right now..... Just what the f** man, just what the f***. How do you let a bust drop 26? How do you fail to score 80 points against one of the worst defenses in the league? I don't care what you do, practice, take HGH, whatever you need to do. I don't ever want to lose to a team like the f***ing Kings/Sonics ever again. I'm tired of losing to sorry a** teams. Thibs, get your fata** off those Twinkies and coach the god damn team. Just un-f**ing-believable.
lovestephon23::Thib lost this team he must go
lovestephon23::Thib lost this team he must go
saucyminxbaby::How is Evans a bust?  He's averaging like 18points, 5assists, 5rebounds and 1.5 steals for his career...  The Kings just put crap around him and thus his team sucks.
Terry 1953::Hey Chicago, you should move your team to Siberia
yardog59::Not far enough!
Greekniko21::And you should remove your d.ick from your dad's mouth.
This_Guy1::I'm tearing up right now....... REALLY? YOU GUYS LET A F***ING BUST DROP 26, AND FAIL TO SCORE EVEN 80 F***ING POINTS AGAINST ONE OF THE WORST DEFENSES IN THE LEAGUE!?!?!?! WHAT TEH F***, TOM, GET YOUR FAT A$$ OFF THOSE TWINKIES AND COACH THE GOD DAMN TEAM! THIS IS BULLS***! JUST PURE F***ING BULLS***! PRACTICE TILL YOU DROP, TAKE HGH, I DON'T GIVE A FLYING F*** WHAT YOU DO! I DON'T EVER WANT TO LOSE TO ANOTHER F***ING SORRY TEAM LIKE THE SORRY A$$ KINGS AGAIN!
Chitowns17::why people hating on rose. its a lot of other problems on the bulls b4 rose. even if he comes back tomorrow good old nate, luol, carlos, kirk and rip will just fail the fans.
antoonn::trade rose  this player is finish no good mental
makersmike::Go Sonics!!!  Can't wait until they are playing in this:  http://www.king5.com/news/local/Hansen-releases-interior-designs-for-new-arena-197899041.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter

rondo2KG::Don't forget J Will!
fairandbalanced00::Embarrassing!! And you feel you can compete against the Heat with a healthy rose with this team??
fergy12314::Everyone relax.  half our bench and our entire starting backcourt are injured. Rip Rose Hinrich Gibson All of these guys are regulars in the rotation.  missing half your rotation, no team will do well.
kool aid 098::its the kings though
Constantinius III::Dat patented Thibs defense.

jlcougar72::Cousins sits and kings play their best game of the season, and win by 42.... Hmmmmmm
JacobyJ4::What... Jimmer plays less than Douglas... after his last game... WTF!!!  That is a joke... Smart is such a $@%!$@
j_erick11::Yeah, odd that he doesn't even get to play more in a blowout like this. No matter, we'll see what the coach does next season.
souptwins::Maybe if it's not Smart.
Hawks_Bulls_Cubs_Bears::this is IFUICIKING crazy!!! IFUICK THE BULLS RIGHT NOW!   FORGET ABOUT THE IFUICIKING $@%!$ DROSE!!! TRADE HIM!!
TheBrownestBob::Any Kings fans still on?  I'm a Cavs fan, but as I look at my team putting together some nice pieces for the future, I can't help but be intrigued by teams who have had high lottery picks for 4 years+ to see what direction they need to go.  So, this is my attempt at fixing the Sacramento Kings.  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=cv8hy3v  I've always believed that until Cousins has someone on his team that is a better player than he is, he won't reach his potential.  Garnett solidifies a locker room of knuckleheads and ball-hogs, and the trade puts the teams focus entirely on a young core of Tyreke, Thomas, and Cousins (not at all a bad trio to build around).  They could then draft Victor Oladipo and Dewayne Dedmon in the draft, sign Kyle Korver to be the starting SF and Antawn Jamison to a 1 year deal to be a positive influence in the locker room and give depth to the frontcourt.  Main 10 players could be...  Starting Lineup -	C – DeMarcus Cousins -	PF – Kevin Garnett -	SF – Kyle Korver -	SG – Tyreke Evans -	PG – Isaiah Thomas  Backups -	C – Dewayne Dedmon   (2nd pick) -	PF – Patrick Patterson	 -	SF – Travis Outlaw -	SG – Victor Oladipo  (1st pick) -	PG – Tony Douglas  I'd appreciate any feedback from actual Kings fans.  Good luck to your team.
RichieJJ88::Not a good idea for the Kings. KG's leadership style would probably make DMC's problems worse. Additionally, a lot of people would rather just trade DMC at this point (if the Kings can get a reasonable offer). Also, the Kings probably won't draft a SG. Reke's our best player (DMC's horribly inefficient), though it's possible he might not be re-signed if a team offers enough too much $ (he's a RFA, but many don't want to re-sign him beyond $10-12M due too his injury history &amp; worries about his streakiness). Of course, the battle w/Seattle takes precedence. If we lose, this doesn't matter.
run4john13::kings wont take Garnett and Garnett will use no trade clause to not play for Kings. Love my Kings (soon Sonics, ef them) but wont work
RichieJJ88::We have a reasonable shot (40-60%) at beating Seattle IMO. But no matter what happens, f*** the Maloofs.
mario_gotze::so why dont the kings move evans to the 3 and thorton to the 2
j_erick11::Evans needs to have a size advantage on the guy guarding him, and the ball in his hands. He needs to be paired with a guard and SF that are pure shooters so he can penetrate or post up, draw the defense and kick to guys that will consistently make threes. It's like the Heat. Lebron gets the offense going because no one can guard him so they help off their man so he finds Battier, or Miller or Allen, etc. for three or Bosh on the mid range. Of course the analogy breaks down when you add Wade, but you get the point. Evans can be a poor man's Lebron playing in a guard's position surrounded by guys that can spot up and light it up. I think that was the point of drafting Jimmer, but Smart doesn't seem to use him like that.
Green Blue Purple Red::That's what they did last year.  It failed.  Evans is not a 3.
RichieJJ88::Also Thornton's not good enough to start. Great scorer, terrible defender, avg.-bad at everything else.
