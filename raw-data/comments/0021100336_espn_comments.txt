dpackrules::Bucks need a big man!!
tipandsip::losing to Detroit is bad...might not want to show up to practice tomorrow
CandySparker::I expect "Knight of the night".
SUCK-IT-D-BAGS::ahhhhhhhhahahahaha stupid wolves fans that think they're going to win a championship this year cause you beat a couple of good teams this year, well this game should say it all for your championship hopes!!!!!!!!!!
SUCK-IT-D-BAGS::oooppss my bad lol, man you guard this board huh!!!
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::LOL, i just happened to be on when you commented and when the last guy i replied to commented. lmao, sorry for the dumba$$ remark, i just meant like just watch what you post cause than trolls will come out too/grammar police/everyone else
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::Lmao, minnesota timberWOLVES won tonight at new jersey 108-105.  Wrong forum dumba$$
rapfan73::how do you beat miami and la  BUT LOSE TO DETROIT PISTONS!!!!!!
herna227::bunch of pistons's scrubs on the raptors team
herna227::has the raptors ever made the playoffs??
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::or simply how do you lose to the pistons
Gt_jackets89::Your username says everything about you
stuckinwisconsin::Woo Hoooooo! Pistons win another game!!!!
Bryant35176::good onya bucks u only had to get within 3.5 points for me to win 2k but you play absolute $@%! two days before you cost me 7k when u beat miami  you reall know how to screw me around dont you
carve123::happy to see the Pistons get a win
Chickendoodle444::Ha Ha
Bryant35176::you would be the only one
RipOnDetroitCityHaventHeardThat1B4::well so much for my pistons going 4-62
YoungKeeks30::Brandon Jennings is the man #TheOutfielder http://www.the-outfielder.com/2012/02/brandon-jennings-official-mixtape.html
Gt_jackets89::This is unacceptable. Skiles needs to be fired, and I sincerely hope he never gets another job after this.
Bryant35176::what a joke two days before they smash them then beat the heat then play that terrible game right from the very start and it is nit like they have been over played
mrbscot::Holy cow! 5 wins means there are two teams worse than the Pistons? They will probably screw up getting the first pick of the lottery now.
DetKoolAid::i would be mad about this win, but knight just refused to lose this one and you can never be mad when your future top player is fed up with losing
Jimdetroitfan94::No need to be mad detkoolaid, Knight played a great game.
CheeseheadNation2011::FEAR THE DEER
mrbscot::Maybe Vanilla Ice at half inspired the Pistons to victory
herna227::Agreed
pistons6684::Ice, Ice, Baby...
phxpilot3::LOL beat the heat lose to the pistons nice contrast in styles mke
stickgril::whats your point??. We stomped on the Pistons on Monday....Both teams are a bunch of scrubs
WiscKYSportsFan3::Rodgers being named MVP and the Bucks beating the Bulls would make my Saturday good. I have a feeling neither will happen.
amscubs13::...You got me there :(
EvolutionaryMokeski::True. Just saying people in glass houses...
travispsixnine::Super Bowl has only been around since the 1960's  World Series has been around a lot longer than that  the Lions at least won a few NFL Championships in the 50's
EvolutionaryMokeski::I'd write a year for the last Lions Super Bowl win but...
travispsixnine::1908
travispsixnine::nice choke job by the Packers in the playoffs
travispsixnine::lol Cubs fan
amscubs13::lol Lions fan^
Lobster83::Rodgers is MVP probably. But he and Brees are both deserving.
EvolutionaryMokeski::Rodgers will win MVP by a land slide.
DetKoolAid::Ben gordon has and always will be a volume shooter, thats why he had to go when D rose got there. On the this pistons team that JoeD is starting to put together BG just doesnt fit, especially for 11 mill a year. Id rather cut our loses and amnesty him or trade him with our 2nd round pick to get another 1st rounder (like the bobcats and cavaliers) last year.   Id rather knight, monroe and next years rookie take the majority of the shots. id feel different if BG wasnt only 6'2" and could actually play a little D but when his jumper is off he is useless
EvolutionaryMokeski::S.O.B. -- Same Old Bucks  What long-time Bucks fan couldn't see this loss coming a mile away? Beat the Heat to get within one game of .500 and draw an awful 4-20 Pistons squad. George Karl would've called it a lack of "happiness management."  Even more amazing that this trend has followed the team through coaching and personnel changes.
dpackrules::Your right.... This has been our pattern for twenty years now!!
MLV_24::The Bucks just need to play Miami for 66  games
WiscKYSportsFan3::66-0.
jamesbik::For sale washed up NBA Player. Nickname capt. Jack cause when he touches the ball he's shooting it He's currently 135th in per-game rank while averaging 32 minutes per game Wants team to extend his contract.    Makes 10 million next year. Will take anybody, 2nd round pick or Snickers candy bar...
jamesbik::But Tyson would lead the league in off. rebounds
bunb4lyfe::who is that?
WiscKYSportsFan3::Imagine him on the Knicks. Baron Davis, Carmelo, Jackson, and Amare. The shot selection and chemistry would be atrocious.
bunb4lyfe::Drummond, Davis, or Barnes?
travispsixnine::I think we need a true center so we can move Monroe to the 4 where he belongs
bunb4lyfe::Sounds good. Make it happen.
DetKoolAid::hell yeah
travispsixnine::Knight Stuckey Barnes Monroe Kaman  good starting 5
DetKoolAid::chris kaman!
WiscKYSportsFan3::Barnes. Knight, Barnes, and Monroe would be a great young trio to build around.
DetKoolAid::yeah we need an athletic wing scorer, we could pick up kaman as another big to pair with monroe in free agency...he wants to come back home to michigan anyway
travispsixnine::nevermind
travispsixnine::Knight- 26 points  Monroe- 19 points  2 good pieces for the Pistons to build on for the future
bunb4lyfe::Yes Sir
blackhawkshadnofansuntil2009::agreed. and throw in jonas jerebko.
WiscKYSportsFan3::Off Topic Question:  When are the NFL regular season awards announced?
confinedstew12::I think Stafford should win it but I understand why some people would vote for Alex Smith. He led his team to a great playoff showing after being terrible the previous years.
WiscKYSportsFan3::Curtis Painter MVP.
bunb4lyfe::Stafford Comeback Player of the Year.
DetKoolAid::stafford had his friggin arms fall off lmao what more would you have to do? alex smith didnt have anything to come back from he has always been the way he played
pistons6684::Seriously, how can someone throw for over 5000 yards in a season after playing only half of last season not be comeback player of the year? Total bull$hit.
WiscKYSportsFan3::Alex Smith was that awful last year that putting up the stats he did this year would warrant him as one of the Comeback Player of the YEar candidates?
DetKoolAid::in the sporting news he finished f*cking 4th, and for the NFL a lot of former players who get votes said they voted for alex smith over stafford which baffled me
Almost Always Ignored::Tomorrow.  There's an award show
WiscKYSportsFan3::Sweet. Thanks.
bunb4lyfe::Where are all the Brandon Knight haters now. I guess Piston fans expect 20 ppg and 10 apg for a rookie with basically no training camp or preseason games.
bunb4lyfe::rather amnesty Charlie V. At least Ben Gordon got some talent.
DetKoolAid::naw BG doesnt do anything good, cant play D or be a play maker, and is a streaky shooter who doesnt really shoot well
blackhawkshadnofansuntil2009::i love brandon knight . him and monroe are the future.
DetKoolAid::knight&gt;stuckey&gt;bg  time to amnesty BG or trade him to free up that 11 mill
WiscKYSportsFan3::Maybe a change of scenery will help him.
DetKoolAid::i once said that too, and now he has been stuck in a 3 year shooting slump
WiscKYSportsFan3::I'd take BG on the Bucks. For the right price, of course.
DetKoolAid::im glad knight took over this game....all the good/decent teams with young good pg's score and use it to set up their playmaking a la D. Rose, Jennings, Westbrook, Irving and now knight (fingers crossed)
bunb4lyfe::Im glad he took over too because all i read today about Brandon Knight is that he cant be the future point guard.
pistons6684::Ok  guys, tell me what you think:  East All Star Reserves:  PG Jennings SG Joe Johnson SF  Granger PF  Amare C    Monroe WC Bosh WC D Will  West All Star Reserves  PG Westbrook SG Ellis SF  Gay PF  Gasol C   Love WC Harden WC Aldridge
DetKoolAid::i hope Monroe makes jt but like i said if Stafford can finish 4th on the sporting news come back player of the year then monroe probably wouldnt even be looked at as a snub....detroit players get no love
buckspackers23::Rondo will make it over D-Will for sure. D-Will has been AWFUL this year. Jennings probably won't make it either.
buckspackers23::He's shooting career lows, and just got his percentage over 40% over the last couple of games by playing leakers...
pistons6684::D-Will averages 20 and 8 a game. I wouldn't call that terrible, although he does average quite a few TOs.
WiscKYSportsFan3::I'd replace Monta Ellis with Kyle Lowry.
blackhawkshadnofansuntil2009::lou williams instead of deron williams, and deng for granger.
blackhawkshadnofansuntil2009::sorry bucks, i know you got a little more to play for then us. anyways nice to see us get a win.
WiscKYSportsFan3::We'll just take out our frustration on the Bulls tomorrow.
WiscKYSportsFan3::"Don't worry Milwaukee, I will lead you to championship glory."  Dwight Howard
amscubs13::We can dream it!
Edward4515::Bucks should honestly look at tanking this season to get another high lotto pick or trade for a young borderline talent SG/SF. Jennings is turning out great, bogut if healthy is a great player. Just need a guy who can shoot but also get to rim cause theres not much talent on this team besides bjen/bogut.
wflannigan::At least you guys put up a fight every night, my pistons have along way to go man!!!!!!!
Edward4515::@wflannigan - hes shooting below 40%, what to do. I just wish theyd win 20 games to save face &amp; tank to a lotto pick. If not then trade to get up higher like bobcats did last year.
buckspackers23::Shut up, one loss doesn't mean shit. I hate when fans freak out out. We just went 6-2 against +.500 teams besides the Pistons.
Edward4515::Besides bjen/bogut, can anyone on this team put up 10-15pts consistently? The bucks either need to trade to get better players or head to the lotto. It would make much more sense to tank this shortened season than a full 82 season. Even if they make the 7th or 8th seed, they arent going much further than the 1st round.
wflannigan::And tell Delfino to stop shooting the ball so much.  He can't shoot or we would have kept him in Detroit
DetKoolAid::hmmm id trade charlie v and daye for delfino and capn jack straight up right about now lol
Almost Always Ignored::Jae Crowder
wflannigan::I wish I could say there will be whole bunch more to follow, but right now beggars can't be choosers
CathyM1975::great game bucks....what a joke...... like what most of these guys in this room have in  their hand in the can.
zabjudah90::U can beat the heat but u cant beat the pistons. Smh fear the deer yea right.
zabjudah90::lol rite.
Almost Always Ignored::The difference is the stadium
wflannigan::I don't believe it, we finally got another W
14Spencer::Jason Maxiell.  My man.
DetKoolAid::yeah he put up old ben wallace numbers lol 8 pts 12 boards and 2 blocks
WiscKYSportsFan3::FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Good game Pistons.
DetKoolAid::lmao i dont know if anyone caught it but brandon knight ran off the floor and away from someone trying to nab him for an interview. hilarious
Hibachiarenas::As long as Houston can keep their 21 point lead i'm in for a nice payday. THANK YOU DETROIT.
Gambling and Rambling::is Stephen Jackson hurt?
Almost Always Ignored::He should just take a nap
Malcyon1::Suffering from Skile-itis.
jamesbik::No he just sucks
jamesbik::shooting 30% and playing 35 mins....yea thats awesome...dude is terrible and washed up
clmlo::yeah rt the dude would put up 18ppg and like 5assists easy if he got the playing time
tamais2::Dead
tubbyt23::This win is the start of a big winning streak!!! Go PISTONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
tamais2::NOW YOU PUT IN LEUER.
Pujols sold out.::I know. It's time to give Skiles a nice fist to the face.
tamais2::Yes
Edward4515::As much as skiles dislikes capt jack, you have to play the guy when a guy like delfino is missing his shots.
pistons6684::Holy $@%!, the Pistons won a game!
Pujols sold out.::Cut Gooden, Sanders, Ilyasova, Udrih, and Bogut.
Almost Always Ignored::Gooden has been a good fill in
WiscKYSportsFan3::Andrew Bogut for Greg Monroe?
Malcyon1::Milwaukee Bucks.  The only team to beat the **** out of perennial title contenders but falls short against the bottom feeders...
clmlo::Bucks fans, what is up with this Ersan Ilyasova? Why does he not get more playing time? The guy seems like a rebound machine.
clmlo::still 12 rebs in like 15mins pt is pretty impressive.
buckspackers23::He doesn't know what a layup is. He had a 3 foot jump shot missed when we were down by 4 with 3 minutes left.
WiscKYSportsFan3::He's also a bad decision making machine.
