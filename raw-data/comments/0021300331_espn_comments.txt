Colin Uza::Way to go Raps! Distributing the ball better without Rudy "the black hole" Gay in the lineup...7 more assists than the season average.  Just getting rid of Gay made the team better!  Great win against a division foe.
Walton Armstrong::LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RAPTORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Randy Dixon::I honestly hip the Sixers get the worst lottery pick possible..these guys are complete joke
Wild Silverback::Yikes.. Are the Sixers even awake tonight??  SMH.
Tanner Pratt::With the new Raptors GM (can't spell name correctly) they will get much better. Trading Derozan and Lowry is something they should do though. Terrance Ross is a stud once given the proper playing time. Jonas V hopefully can continue to improve after being drafted so high. But they can trade those guys get more assets and really improve. Their GM is a stud. Already GM of the year
Wild Silverback::BWA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !!!
Will Bernanke::2ND HALF UNDER 100 IS A LOCK,  RAPTORS ARE VERY VERY INEPT, WOULD NOT SHOCK ME IF THEY SCORED 28 PTS IN 2ND HALF, ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR LOWLIFE COACH
Jason Aschenbrenner::OOOOOOOOOOOver
Warren Acoose::Getting rid of Rudy Gay made their offense better, so over.
Randall Semeniuk::lol you obviously don't watch the raptors enough
Patrick MacKinnon::Whichever team loses wins! Let the best Tank win!
Mang Artemio::cmon phillys make some basket here....
Wild Silverback::Great comeback.. Go 76ers !!
Jesse Travers::is ross starting?
Randall Semeniuk::yes
