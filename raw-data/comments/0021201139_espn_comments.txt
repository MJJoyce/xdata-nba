MemberName970::Does anyone here actually care that BK won? ... No, didnt think so.
Ameero80::Seriously Gerald Wallace.. A mere one point, one rebound 5 assist performance.. You sure were worth the pick that turned out to be Damian Liilard! smh
RNYC_125::Brooklyn sucks
NetsMagazine8::YOU SUCK FOR HAVING 4 NBA TEAMS...WHO DOES THAT?
MlCHAEL J0RDAN::Why am I not surprised...
nysports4life74::BROOOOKKKLLYN!!
bobcats 2020 nba champs::give us about 7 years
Ontario925::The Nets almost won the game last night against the Bulls too after having a huge lead. One thing you can say about the Nets is they are winning over below .500 teams they are suppose to beat. They have swept the Cavaliers,Bobcats,and others in 3 game matches each this season. Good teams do that. Sure the Nets are not an elite NBA team now but they are still a good NBA team.
Ontario925::Good. You have two NBA teams in the NYC area in the Postseason. That is actually good for the NBA interest too. An NBA type of Big Apple Subway Series.
Bob-Swagg Smith.::Those teams aren't in the playoffs so they'll be crying after round 1.
Bob-Swagg Smith.::Okay now I've seen it all.  <b>THE MEASLY SHITLATTO BOBCATS</b> stayed in the game with you.  HA!  Give up on life Nets.  It's ashame to be so bad.  I mean are you kidding?  Knicks are on an 11 game winning streak and you're playing like this!?  Wow!  Knicks &gt; Nets.  Basic principals.  Doesn't matter who either of us play cause were going all the way, and you're losing in the FIRST ROUND!  Suck it for life losers!
jrtall3n7::Knicks beat the Bobcats by 9 points in their last meeting. Same as the Nets.
meangreenmachine1616::All the way to where? A first round sweep at the hands of your opponent? Yep, wouldn't be surprised. After all, these are the Knicks we are speaking of.
rossalan5::how many playoff games have you guys won in the last 10 years??? yup 1..
Golden Bucks::Bobcats completely suck Micheal Jordan should hang himself have fun getting a crap  number one pick and losing again next year
Ontario925::Because he and Chicago owned Milwaukee.
thetrickbob::says the bucks fan
Golden Bucks::Are there actullally any bobcat fans alive on here LOL
Sir_Gunners::Here.
CoolRod365::Cats!
bobcats 2020 nba champs::here
A DieHard Charlotte Hornet-Bobcat fan since 1989::I'm right here.
Nayrock10::Would of been a upset if you guys lost to this tean
Jake5622Jake::why does everyone hate the nets????
Rezo201::It's not hate, it's respect. The Nets are no longer a joke, they're a threat to most teams. Therefore fans talk crap about them.
Bob-Swagg Smith.::lol...
UNCHeels725.::Cause were good.
Bob-Swagg Smith.::lol...
53dario::TIM DUNCAN ALL CLASS
denzioKNICKS4lyf::congrats for winning against the BOBCATS CROOKLYN NETS :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D
denzioKNICKS4lyf::51/2 games more to go and you'll stop kissing KNICKS pretty A$$
capclip9::Congrats on being about to win your first division title in nearly 20 years, and it's nice that you honored your last championship team from 40 years ago the other night, which only reminded everybody that it's been 40 YEARS since your last championship. Not that the Nets can crow about a glorious history, but neither can the Knicks, yet Knicks fans do anyway.
UNCHeels725.::2-2 stupid.
Sir_Gunners::.
meangreenmachine1616::It looked like the Nets weren't even trying out there!! The Bobcats made this game waaaaaaaay too close!! Luckily we were not playing a good team or we would have been demolished with that kind of effort!!
djny2k12::Nets need to win against over .500 teams.....they've been doing an excellent job of beating the teams that they are suppose to beat....what would be really impressive is if they can beat pacers and celtics on the road. I know they are 2-0 against pacers and 2-1 against celtics.
9edr0::Brooklyn should have traded Humphries for Gordon
ADLA4LIFE::Hump for Gordon straight up yes, but they wanted a pick, hell no. Hump with Nets a trade chip for 12 mil; Gordon with Nets a trade chip WITH NO PICK. some of you dumb dumbs are just plain clueless.
thekola::i said this 20 minutes ago. Billy King needs to answer for that.
thekola::yup. Hump has been pretty bad this year. i think he's distracted by all the crap with his WH.ORE ex wife.
9edr0::it would have been good for both teams
djny2k12::Glad nets won but I've been very disappointed in the bench....they are wildly inconsistent....can't hold a lead. The only consistent performer is Blatche and he too is prone to make dumb plays. Everyone else is just way up and down....Bogans, CJ Watson, Brooks, Humphries....
Sir_Gunners::I hate you Dunlap, let MKG do his thing!!!!!!
Sir_Gunners::Looks like the Nets pulled off an upset. This will live on in history. (sarcasm)
ssuri7::Nets fans, I have a question. Sure Reggie is an awesome rebounder. But if they employ Hack-A-Evans in the playoffs, do we play Blatche instead?
thekola::as long as he stays at 50% you leave him in. I don't expect the other team to score every other possession with Reggie on the floor.
159Yanks::Nets win
UNCHeels725.::<b>NETS AND PHILLIES WON!</b>
meangreenmachine1616::Lets Go Mets!! 2nd Place, Baby!!
mikeyjm1412::The mets won too!
mikeyjm1412::-___- Forever alone...
mikeyjm1412::No love the the METS?
ssuri7::Deroooooooooon
steelersbobcatsredsox::mkg needs to play 30+ minutes over these last games
9edr0::but he wont....because Dunlap sucks
UNCHeels725.::@Bobcat  fans, do Hairston, Bullock, and McAdoo make their decisions today?
pantherfan2488::We want McLemore anyways
9edr0::yea Noel would be nice i think his knee will be fine
steelersbobcatsredsox::we already might have three next year with the blazers pick (wallace trade) pistons pick (magette trade) and our own pick, we might as well take a big and hope he proves people wrong about this years draft
9edr0::trade the pick for more picks in 2014 draft its loaded
steelersbobcatsredsox::no we dont
9edr0::Williams said they will probably stay
UNCHeels725.::;)
RaffiC22::LOUISVILLE!!!!!!!!!!
JTorcasso::Jeff Adrien needs more playing time
UNCHeels725.::Just to clarify I'm a Nets fan.
mikeyjm1412::Good to know... It is all good if you like other teams though...
steelersbobcatsredsox::williams has the worst tattoo
Ragnarisboss::REGGIE WITH ANOTHER 20 REBOUND NIGHT...
mikeyjm1412::You mean reggie miller?
9edr0::against the Bobcats....not really impressive
9edr0::fire Dunlap ASAP no clue what he is doing
meangreenmachine1616::Reggie!! Reggie!!
pantherfan2488::All of a sudden there  are a bunch of Bobcats haters on here?  You know the spread was -15! don't act for a second like this isn't a little bit embarrassing
mikeyjm1412::Says the bulls fan who will cry when the pacers run you guys over in the playoffs... IN THE FIRST ROUND!
mikeyjm1412::Thats more like it... A 2nd round knockout! Woot!
BJett20884::Unless the Pacers drop to the 4 seed  the Nets will be facing the Bulls.... Which the Nets obviously can't beat even with the Bulls "D" team
BJett20884::Don't sweat it. The Nets suck... They will be a first round playoff exit
BigPhilly517::The Lolcats. Getting your pocket picked by Brook Lopez? Really Ben Gordon?
UNCHeels725.::Stop.
UNCHeels725.::I'm a Nets fan.
BigPhilly517::U mad?
ssuri7::i wish lopez got that board...i don't want reggie going to the line
159Yanks::Evan hits both free throws
53dario::LEBRON&gt;YOUR TEAM
JTorcasso::are you on the Heat? no, just hoppin on the bandwagon
UNCHeels725.::MVP REGGIE!
UNCHeels725.::REGGIE MVP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ssuri7::D-WILL!!!!!!
53dario::LEMVP
JTorcasso::?
rparks2361::Gordon is garbage
JTorcasso::lol
djny2k12::The old D-Will....blowing by people and attacking the basket...too bad he didn't take the last shot against the Bulls
JTorcasso::I have officially given up on Biz. He jumps on every shot fake, and can't score
9edr0::he has done well this game tho
steelersbobcatsredsox::why is pargo in right now?
mikeyjm1412::dumplaz
9edr0::Dumlap
9edr0::yep gonna be rage mode if he doesn't get fired
steelersbobcatsredsox::and mkg has played under 20 minutes after playing one of his better games of the season, dunlap is an idiot
pantherfan2488::Itll Be Kemba Henderson, Gordon McBOb Biz
53dario::LEMVP
9edr0::put Kemba in Dumlap
