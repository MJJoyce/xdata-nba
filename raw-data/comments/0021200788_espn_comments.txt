BigVicTIA::Lakers Suck. Period
Peter26811::laker fans stop talking about 16 titles blah blah blah. 5 of them were won in minneapolis and i'm sure none of you migrated with the team from minnesota. you never hear celtic fans brag about 17 titles(all one in their current city) stop living in the past that you more than likely werent alive to witness. today, here and now, the clippers are a class above LA. they own LA right now, that could change, but right now they run things.
1KobeFans::The whole point of nba is to win championships RIGHT? So shut up
LeWade Dwyames..::u never hear celtics fans brag about their 17 titles??? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FUNNIEST $@%! I HAVE EVER READ
LetsPlayScRyB::whats worse lakers d or kevin durants d?
Ivanov21::Kobe might have discovered his facilitator game, but this makes Steve Nash look like Mario Chalmers on the floor. Too bad for LA Kobe can't continue his "usual" playing style while Nash is dropping dimes. This just isn't working the way it's supposed to.
Ivanov21::I forgot : HHUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUHEUHEUHEHUEHUEHEUHUEHEU !!
blackburn_PAC10::Angels didn't make the playoffs and now the lakers won't... The most hype I've ever heard for either team and they both blow.  not sure which team was more dissapointing.  definitely a year to forget.  Regards, Dissapointed Fan
Peter26811::the angels finished with nearly 90 wins. the lakers have a losing record and dont remotely look like a playoff worthy team. the lakers are definitely worse and more dissappointing
gatorfan808::The laker defense is not just horrible, it is lazy.  Watching the game, the Clippers were getting fast breaks from the Lakers made baskets.  No chance of making the playoffs.
Get your foot off the boat::They take after their leader, Kobe.   Now they all just hang around looking for a cheap steal.....fortunately, no one ever gets tired.
kiyastep::If all the Lakers played like their leader, 20 points (over 50% from the field) 11 assists Lakers would have won.
younged510::Heat v.s. Clippers NBA finals.. That's right I said it, I called Heat/Thunder last year and said Heat would beat Thunder, I 'm calling this year as well.. Heat vs. Clippers! Heat win 4-2..
arizonasportsman::Stephen Smith reporting Howard to leave Lakers in Summer for Nets ;)
Ivanov21::I hope he goes then, he'll win nothing in LA, he'll win nothing in BKN
Cleeepers::Shame. I was hoping he'd stay... spend the next 5 years in Blake's shadow as L.A.'s soap-opera team... "Will they or won't they make the playoffs?"... tune in next week to find out, and to see who Dwight throws under the bus!  #GuiltyPleasure
FrankieFatal::Flint Tropics &gt; Lakers
LAisShowtime84::The Clippers are hoping for that first Pacific Division Title. Then maybe they will have something, albeit it a pathetic divisional banner, to hang up in staples.  Clippers fans must be so excited.
johnnydhow22::Very well put!
Cleeepers::We get it... lakers have "been there before" and the Clips are "virgins". Sure you can laugh at us about to "get some" for the first time, but when your own team's identity right now is that of a tired old geezer overspending for viagra (all-stars), desperate to get one last piece of tail (kobe's 6th) - and still unable to "get it up" (make the playoffs), there's something hateful, bitter and pathetic about you guys ridiculing that excited young virgin.  #flaccid #impotent #geriatric #haters
Ivanov21::touché
johnnydhow22::Great job clippers!
SportsNation113::I hope somehow the Lakers make the playoffs as the 7th seed and play the Clippers who are the 2nd seed. and Clippers sweep Lakers and would be 8-0 against them
kiyastep::Well if the Lakers made the playoffs that would mean theyd be playing their best basketball of the season and any NBA wouldn't really want to match up with them. If they would have started hot and made the 8th seed that would be different
LAisShowtime84::Keeeeeep talking Clippers - Never won anything, never been close to even playing in a finals.  Ain't no banners for the regular season.
SportsNation113::I know, especially the Lakers fans. They just can't accept anything, they can't let anything go. in the next 20 years they will still talk about this season and make exuses
Cleeepers::sub-par? I think not. The lottery is the new "par" for Jimbo's lakers.
kiyastep::It's obvious Lakers are having a sub par season.... ITs the statements like Clippers own L.A. I question.
SportsNation113::Damn! still hating on the Clippers. Give up bro and accept the lost
Cleeepers::Stay tuned... it's coming. First of many coming in April.
kiyastep::Not hating... there's a difference between hating and calling a spade a spade. Clippers havent even won the Pacific division.
Lacker_Tards_A joke::some people have no life and can't accept reality.
SportsNation113::The Lakers fans can't handle that they lost and thats why they are still posting here and making excuses and sh*t
SportsNation113::thats a run on sentence bro
kiyastep::That's english not basketball
kiyastep::Talk basketball show me you know what you are talking about...
arizonasportsman::Lakers will finish season at 42-42.
Peter26811::arizonasportsman - Lakers will finish season at 42-42.  impossible. theirs 82 games in a season
SportsNation113::D'Antoni does not know how to coach a team for shi*t.. Vinny Del Negro knows how to run a team.. Clippers all the way!
kiyastep::Lakers have talent... I agree with your D'Antoni evaluation
kiyastep::Assumptions 42-42? And the guy is a comedian. I don't think that was funny and I think the Lakers if howard plays like he should, and D'Antoni figures out something that the Laker front office already knows, Gasol is a valuable player, even Bynum played with Gasol well enough to win championships.
SportsNation113::haha this guy is a comedian

LAisShowtime84::The Clippers - Talking trash abou the regular season, when we are not the best team in the League nor the conference since 1970.  PS - We have never won anything. We have never stepped foot in a conference finals, but to watch others play.
SportsNation113::Still can't handle the fact that the Lakers suck this year..
Cleeepers::Promised a superteam, handed a tu rd... who wouldn't be mad?
0776Randy::You're really upset about this Clipper thing aren't you?
SportsNation113::i think he is
Cleeepers::Today, here and now, in the present...  http://www.nba.com/standings/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Cnf.html  U mad, Bro?
LAisShowtime84::Still talking....  Still haven't won anything.....
Cleeepers::We'll wait for the playoffs to see who's best.  Hope the fish are bitin' for ya!
LAisShowtime84::"Talking trash about the regular season, when we are not the best team in the League nor the conference"  Thanks for proving my point.
Lacker_Tards_A joke::Urban dict needs a new proper DEF for lakers, biggest FLOP sack of dog $@%! team that dissapointed all their delusional retar.ded fans

Lawrence246::For a few months now, Ive been using this system called SportsBettingStar to help me pick out some winning bets.  In just 60 days using this system, Ive managed to doubled my earnings by following this system.  You can find this system on the first page of google by looking up Sports Betting Systems.
LAisShowtime84::I hear that when the a Clipper's fan has a crush, they like their neighbor the $@%! their crush 16 times before they even have a chance.  They are all about maybe getting that sloppy 17ths.
Cleeepers::Clippers = Hot young babe who everybody wants. lakers = Saggy old witch on her knees behind a dumpster.
SportsNation113::Dear Lakers fan.. F*ck the Lakers.. Clippers owns LA now, you guys can say we have 16 Championships all you want because we all know you guys love bringing up the past and thats why all you Lakers fans favorite channel is the history channel just like the Celtic fans.. just watch in the next 10 years.. Clippers will own LA for the next 10 years.. and this is here and now
SportsNation113::Well we are a good team hahaha and ha... poor Lakers fans, can't handle the fact that they suck this year
kiyastep::They are below par for now. Win the Pacific first....
LAisShowtime84::Wake me up with your smack talk when you win ONE title.  Or in the case of the Clippers, go to ONE WCF.
kiyastep::wow haters not even basketball lovers..
Cleeepers::Wake us up when you're a .500 team again.
Lacker_Tards_A joke::well said FUKC LAisshowtime
Cleeepers::Roman: "Once upon a time, we were feared and ruled the known world, but nowadays we're a laughing stock"  laker fan: "Tell me about it"
kiyastep::It actually isn't a bother, its more like with every post I see it's gets more away from actually talking basketball which to me why these blogs exist... I miss good blogs
Cleeepers::Key word... "yet". Unfortunately, they don't hand them out in February, but just wait a couple of months. Nobody's even close to us.
kiyastep::no actually I watch it daily, Im not a one team fan I 've played and for many years followed a successful franchise&gt; What I find funny is its not even a finished season and The Clips haven't even won the Pacific yet
Cleeepers::I bet you miss good basketball too.
kiyastep::1 season unsuccessful season doesnt mean the end, just like one season a dynasty is not built...
kiyastep::hmm thought this was a basketball blog...
Cleeepers::You know where I live?  Obviously not.
LAisShowtime84::kiyastep - don't bother. They are trolls who clearly don't live in LA. They think that one season being better than the lakers erases their decades of irrelevancy, and that the Clippers are now the "in" team in LA.
Cleeepers::That's good because the odds of getting there decrease with every loss.
kiyastep::Gave up? unsuccessful means no championship. IM not settling for just playoffs...
kiyastep::Id like my own statement but that's kind of weird
Cleeepers::Romans said the same thing.

LAisShowtime84::They are top three here!  http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/sports-worstsportsfranchises/12/
Lacker_Tards_A joke::Articles written by morons like you are the only positive thing you have to go on these days.
LAisShowtime84::"We are the Clippers, we talk trash about the regular season!"  Get to the WCF one time. Just ONE TIME. Then you can maybe begin to think about talking.
Lacker_Tards_A joke::LA is showtime is that isolated kid that everybody picks on with no friends.
Cleeepers::Sources: Lakers are relocating from Staples center to the La Brea tar pits. When asked why, Kupcake responded "Well, we think our players will be comfortable among the other dinosaurs and it's about time those dusty old banners were put in a museum".
kiyastep::After getting to the western conference final, Clippers only have 28 more times win them to match the Lakers.

KatelynFabersLawyer211::25-29 with a $100mil roster. LMMFAO!!!!
kiyastep::And a very expensive coach that career wise has won only half his games career wing regular season .529. maybe that explains something. AS far 100 mil. Ive heard that before and one of the new players doesn't deserve 19 million.
Cleeepers::Actually, 2 very expensive coaches. Mike Brown is laughing it up on a beach somewhere at Jimbo's expense.
Cleeepers::It'll be $200,000,000 next year.  #unsustainable
Lacker_Tards_A joke::Clippers will be blowing out the lakers for a long time in staples, get used to it Showtime.
kiyastep::For a long time is an opinion... we'll see, not even sure that Clippers can win the championship let alone the Pacific division
Cleeepers::Can he even call himself that anymore?  Magic said that the Clippers are now showtime... same way Shaq gave Griffin the "superman" nickname.
slamdaballpunk::How come the posts stop.....gotta say some funny back and forths.....but does look like another Clipper blow out!!!!!!!!!
Lacker_Tards_A joke::LOL at this delusional loser prolly the only bltch dumb enough to back his fakers still think they have a shot at anything this year or next.
KatelynFabersLawyer211::What else do we have to go by? The Laker$ aren't making the playoffs this year.
LAisShowtime84::You mean like how the Lakers have been to the finals 50% of the time, and haven't gone for the past 2 years, so by the laws of probability.....
KatelynFabersLawyer211::It's called the laws of probability.
LAisShowtime84::And you know this because.. You have the ability to see the future?  Can you give me the next top stock picks? Or the super bowl winners for the next 10 years?
Lacker_Tards_A joke::u mad your team sux? yup ahahahahhahaha
Cleeepers::lakers are in the NBA?  Sorry, I didn't realize... I usually don't scroll that far down the standings.
LAisShowtime84::Shh... Real fans of the NBA are talking..  Go take a nap, find your teddy.. Just shhhh
Cleeepers::Done like the lakers?
LAisShowtime84::Shhhhhh. You are done now, child.
Cleeepers::I know that the lakers can't beat the Clippers.
LAisShowtime84::You know nothing child.  Shhhhhh. You are done now.
Cleeepers::We can only make statements on regular season games because that's all the lakers are going to be playing.
LAisShowtime84::Nope, I do find it comical that you guys are making all these judgements/statements off regular season games.  That and you guys clearly have no business sense in terms of the NBA.
Lacker_Tards_A joke::Atleast the superstars thrive there and your HOFS went there to crash and burn loser.
LAisShowtime84::Wow dude.. What the $@%! is that.. It looks like you tried to write a sentence and fell flat on your face.  Try again.
Cleeepers::Get used to it... Clippers are gonna be blowing the lakers out for the foreseeable future.
LAisShowtime84::After years of being LA's dumpster, it must be nice to finally catch a glance of daylight.
LA Clipp Joint::Howard will demand that Kobette be traded or forced off team at the end of this season or he will threaten to walk .... so management what do you do ????  get younger or lace up concrete chucks for the next 5 to 10 years
Lacker_Tards_A joke::Argueing with LAisshowtime is like trying to talk to a r3tard just let him sulk in his grave like the dead fakers
KatelynFabersLawyer211::Nah, Vanessa Bryant just added me as a contact on AdultFriendFinder, so I think I'm gonna chill with her.
KatelynFabersLawyer211::I was talking to my Clipper cohorts, Laker scum.
LAisShowtime84::Go mack your sister, Texas trash.
LA Clipp Joint::Shaq got 3 Finals MVPs brought LA 3 World Titles (not by himself but contributed nearly 80%) ... and got ridiculed and run out of town
kiyastep::SHaq contributed 80% hmm spoken by a Clippers fan I'm sure.
LAisShowtime84::Shhhhhh. You are done now, child.
Cleeepers::You still didn't answer my question...  What was untrue about my saying the lakers are in the toilet?
LAisShowtime84::Wow.. That is grade school level right there.  What is next are you going to say that you are rubber and I am glue.   Sophomoric thy name is Cleeepers.
Cleeepers::Now I know you're full of it... Friends... haha!
LAisShowtime84::Haha.. Again with the lack of foresight, it is incredible. You really don't know anything.  Keep going.. I have some friends in here reading your stuff and we are all busting up laughing at you.
Cleeepers::Really? what did I say that is untrue?
LAisShowtime84::Again, you prove your ignorance.  Haha.. This is great. Please keep going! You complete lack of knowledge is incredibly amusing.
Cleeepers::"The most prestigious franchise" is in the toilet... their historically excellent owner is close to death and his imbecile son has turned that team that you keep talking about who won B2B titles just 3 years ago into a lottery team without a 1st round pick.  You wanna teach a business class? Start with Jimbo.
LAisShowtime84::Cleeepers - your knowledge of the business end of the NBA is infantile.  You need to learn how the league works - and remind yourself that until you go to a WCF, saying you have taken the throne from the most prestigious franchise in the game is beyond laughable.
LAisShowtime84::No one asked you. Texas trash.
Cleeepers::Yeah, laker fans are all about history... because they have no present or future.
KatelynFabersLawyer211::Exactly. The way Laker fans crap on Shaq nowadays makes me sick.
LAisShowtime84::That is not what happened. You should re-read your history.
LA Clipp Joint::just putting it out there that Karma is real and that Kobette will be treated in the same fashion that he treated Shaq
LAisShowtime84::And pray tell LA Clipp Joint.. what happened to Shaq?
Cleeepers::Good point.
Cleeepers::At this point, does anyone really care?
Adam8066::Kobe is a true cry baby worse than Dwight.
Lacker_Tards_A joke::LA is showtime lives his life in the past cause his life and team suck so bad what a true Kobetard sucks to be him ahahahahahhahaha

LAisShowtime84::Good year for the niners? Choking on Ray's dick in the super bowl is good to you?  What would i expect from a gay city like sf.

Cleeepers::$100,000,000 for the 10-spot... yeah, there's a sustainable business model.
LAisShowtime84::hahaha.. Okay, I am done with you. You clearly don't know what you are talking about.  Free agents picked the Clippers over the Lakers? wtf are you smoking. The lakers didn't really pursue any free agents.  What should I expect from a clippers fan.. HAHAH!!!  I live in LA, and can tell you - this town is still laker country. Enjoy being better in the regular season. Maybe you can get to the WCF, and bring that banner home to your meaningless franchise.
Cleeepers::Yeah, he turned Phil Jackson into Mike D'Antoni!
LAisShowtime84::For ONCE, your team is better than the Lakers, and now you are the Kings of the city??  The Lakers will not win this year, hell they have played horrible (I never said they were a "good team"). That doesn't mean they are done. They still have talent and Mitch is a magician.
Cleeepers::My foresight tells me that next year, your $100,000,000 group of losers will cost you $200,000,000.  Free agents were picking the Clips over the lakers last Summer, and after this season, it's only going to get worse for you.  Stick a fork in the lakers.
LAisShowtime84::You lack any foresight.   1 - go to hoopshype.com 2 - look at salaries 3 - look at how the Lakers approach FA, and understand that any young and talented FA player would LOVE to be Laker.  You are DELUSIONAL to think the Clippers are anything but LA's red headed step child.
Cleeepers::I'M delusional? laker fans still think they have a good team... now THAT'S delusional.
LAisShowtime84::The new generation of LA fans gravitating.. dude... it has been less than one year, and you have literally done nothing, ever.  You are so delusional, it is not even funny. Look at how many commercials? HAHAH! Bro, are you for real? or are you just trying to make me laugh? Cause this is the dumbest $@%! i have ever read.
Cleeepers::again with the history... I don't think you should be talking about crappy F.O's when Jimbo and Kupcake are playing "Thelma &amp; Louise" and driving all that history off a cliff.
Cleeepers::look at the standings, then look at the TV and tell me how many more commercials Blake and CP3 are in than kobe and Coward. It's not about the length of time they have had success, it's about the new generation of L.A. fans gravitating toward the new showtime instead of "those old guys that always lose".
LAisShowtime84::You clearly don't know how basketball work from an organizational standpoint.. of course, why would you... you are a Clippers fans.   Other than getting gifted CP3 by the commish, all your team has done is $@%! things up.
kiyastep::lol just over half a season of success, too early to claim take over
Cleeepers::Your team is done... old, and getting older... a clusterf*ck of epic proportions that everyone can see but laker "fans".

LAisShowtime84::PS - you are just bitter cause less than 5 years ago we were sending you home from the playoffs without breaking a sweat.  Texas trash.
LAisShowtime84::LOL.  Your $@%!$@ SPURS won't win a title this year.  Enjoy your franchise falling apart when Duncan, Parker and Ga-blow-me leave, and your rag tag organization in %!$@%! $@% gutter Texas is irrelevant. No one wants to play in that backwards !$@ state, in the most boring franchise in the league.
KatelynFabersLawyer211::HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA!!!!!!  TYPICAL Laker fan. I pity you clowns.
LAisShowtime84::Who is your team?
KatelynFabersLawyer211::The Laker$ are trash RIGHT NOW. Nobody gives a damn about your history.
LAisShowtime84::Well duh.. when you go to half the finals series ever, expectations of the franchise is high.  Most other teams are happy when they make a conference finals. The lakers are only happy when they win.  Hence the typical smack talk to a lakers fan is "you won't win this year". Maybe so, but they will be back.. they always come back.
Get your foot off the boat::I think if you were to ask Jamison his thoughts about the Lakers history I don't think he would give a crap about it.  I think he decided to come to LA because he thought they would contend for  a title this year, not because they won 16 of them previously.
LAisShowtime84::Titles are all that matter. Only fans of $@%!$@ teams live in the here and now, because they have no legacy, no clout, no greatness to speak of.
bizz...::You  dont  watch  basketball  much  do  you,,,......They  cant  even  keep  from  getting  blown  out  in their  own  arena....Remember  the  Roman  Empire.......History  dude.........Its  lebron  &amp;  the  Heat  now    Show  some  respect  ...
LAisShowtime84::PS - I will respect you when you make it to double digit finals appearances, let alone victories.  YOU need to learn some respect.
LAisShowtime84::HAHAHA!  If you are a Heat fan, which I gather you are, the lakers have the same amount of titles in the last five years as your whole raggedy $@% franchise history.  So now you say the Lakers are history?  The Lakers have been to HALF of all the finals. In 2015 only Dwight Howard will be left on the roster, and all that will be left to do is poach the next young free agent superstar to start the next dynasty.   Best organization in the league, your trash team should take notes.
LAisShowtime84::I will say it again. Making the playoffs less than three years from going back to back is flopping? Did you say the same thing about the spurs in 2008-09?  Are you like 10 years old or something? Because this is an painfully simple overstatement.
kiyastep::One of the new tradees for the Lakers is overpriced and not worth what he is asking for.
LAisShowtime84::This is Kobe's sunset. Not a big deal, he has had a great run.  The organization did all they could to help him compete, and you can't fault them for that.  People keep bringing up the money.. That means nothing to the Lakers, they just signed a 6 billion dollar tv deal. Having that much payroll is a HUGE advantage, as you can turn money into player later on (see Kwame for Pau).  Mark my words, the Lakers will win another title before 2020, and probably 2018.
Get your foot off the boat::If you think this team was assembled as some long term project...you are solely mistaken.    Not making the playoffs with a $110 million payroll ($85 mil of which is paid to the 5 Laker starters), several all-stars (2 of which are starters in this year's game), and having Kobe Bryant as the leader..would definitely go down as one of the biggest flops in NBA history.
RNYC::If Jim buss didn't hire d'antoni D12 would be more valuable to the lakers
kiyastep::I am a Laker fan, Ive seen Dwight in action, to argue with Nash even shows instability.
dwade for commish::no team is dethroning the champs if they stay healthy.
KatelynFabersLawyer211::Not at all. 25-29 with a $100mil roster is absolutely pathetic.
LAisShowtime84::Less than three years removed from back to back titles is garbage? What does that mean for your team?  I appreciate that you think the Lakers should win every year and that is the expectation of the franchise given their monumental history, but it just not possible to win every year.  I am glad that you expect them to be title contenders though - that is the true hallmark of how great the Lakers are as a franchise. Cheers!
KatelynFabersLawyer211::Quit whining. Your team is GARBAGE; deal with it.
LAisShowtime84::Overstatement much?
LAisShowtime84::It is amazing what collusion will do.. Isn't it?
LAisShowtime84::Also.. Last I checked Pau, Nash nor Dwight conspired with Kobe to get to LA.  Trades are not collusion.
LAisShowtime84::And all four are in their primes, and should garner a max salary... right?
DodgersLakersUberAlles::^^ See, like this guy. LOL  Apparently making trades and acquisitions within the league's rules is equal to collusion.   Dont open the door for trolls by using their logic. :)
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Dont do that.  We call BS when people say that about the Lakers right?
MinniWolves90::Hello?! 4 HOFers on one team?!
DodgersLakersUberAlles::If Lebron can continue the INSANE production he's been putting up for the last month, they are definitely the favs.
numb1lakefanespn::dwight howard is a beast but doesnt want to be a laker or contribute to a laker win
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Yeah, he'd rather be happy than win, and Kobe trying to force him to win isnt making him happy.   Let this guy go somewhere where the fans dont mind when you're smiling after losses to your crosstown rival, in the worst season of the franchises last 30 years.   Next.
desmond240::it already has, they guy got rid of every thing phil had built up in that franchise, why didn't he just continue with what was there
DodgersLakersUberAlles::^^ Jerry Buss. Jim is the F up son who is running the Billion dollar organization.   No formal education and doesnt "believe" in scouting.  Fasten your seat-belts laker fans, this could get dicey.
hofersf49::why would you wish him to be in the hospital?
desmond240::wish you were jim buss, we need to trade this guy
desmond240::he was a hyped beast in orlando
Phillyteamsforever::Blake Griffin is becoming a beast
KatelynFabersLawyer211::Yeah, and the Laker$ also had the luxury of the ref$ having their backs.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Awe, the refs complaint.   Cute.
KatelynFabersLawyer211::Blake actually is a pretty solid defender. Better than you'd think, at least.
KatelynFabersLawyer211::DodgersLakersUberAlles - ^^Yeah, Unsta said he had some stats re; his defense. Hopefully he comes back with those...  He's got a good defensive rating, but that stat can be misleading when you play next to a dominant defender, or play on a great defensive team(Carlos Boozer, for example). I'm not even sure who the Clippers' best defender is. Bledsoe?
DodgersLakersUberAlles::^^Yeah, Unsta said he had some stats re; his defense. Hopefully he comes back with those...
desmond240::clippers have no excuses they should win it all , the lakers won back to back with a lesser team
MinniWolves90::Half a block per game just isn't good enough for a guy with his athleticism.
MinniWolves90::A man with his athleticism should be grabbing more rebounds, and he needs to pay attention to detail on defense.  These are the only major deficiencies of his game.
MinniWolves90::He's improving a lot every year. But he's still a below-average defender.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::^^ I hadn't heard that. Which stats are you looking at?
Ustna9::Statistically, he is a top defender at his position.
Ustna9::Yes. He is nowhere near his ceiling...
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Same as he ever was, just playing with CP3 now.  Remember when David West was an all star? lol
DodgersLakersUberAlles::He's good.  But he's not an All Star without Paul.
desmond240::west is still very good just playing in indiana
MinniWolves90::CLIPTNYTE Kobe is absolutely AMAZING PLAYER the best there ever was in the NBA.. no doubt..  Just watch old film of Jordon.. you can see it.. ---- You misspelling *Jordan* more than once nullifies your argument.  Michael &gt; Kobe. No debate.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Yeah, when you put the career stats side by side, it aint pretty for Kobe.
dwade for commish::LOL
dwade for commish::Chris Paul not even the best assist man in his own family LOL
Vanquish78::Because he doesn't have to be.  There more to the game than stats.
desmond240::what's this more i want to know
MinniWolves90::Gibby1934 - wade might be top 5 sg but not even close to number 1. to inconsistent on a nightly basis to be number 1. --- http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01/gamelog/2013/ He's as consistent and efficient as any other SG in the league.
Gibby1934::HArden and kobe both have more assist and steals per game. but they also have more turnovers. so its closer than i thought.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Yeah, anything under 1-3 isnt correct. Wade is a top SG.   2's are inconsistent by nature.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::^Hmmm Just PPG? I'm not sure PPG is the best way to see who the "best player" is.
MinniWolves90::Harden/Kobe are 1-2 in TOs, I believe.
Gibby1934::well the numbers say he is number 3 right now. Kobe and Harden are both infront in points. ill give him the nod on defense since neither of those guys plays d any more. im biased though because i think he hurts the heat on offense.
dwade for commish::his only knock is health.......at 100% he's the best......and the heat are unbeatable.
dwade for commish::Is there anyone out there who honestly believes the Lakers would be under .500 right now had they hired Phil?  Would like to hear them defend that stance.
numb1lakefanespn::the triangle was killed by the mavs
CLIPTNYTE::The Lakers would be fine without the Injuries ( Howard -Back, Gasol..) and If Stockton.. oh opps  Steve Nash hadnt gotten hurt... He is not the same ever since this injury.. if these guys were healthy.. nobody would be calling for Coach Jackson !!!
DodgersLakersUberAlles::We have a losing record while being completely healthy as well (albeit, its a small sample size. I think 10-12 games at 100%)
desmond240::when they hired d'antoni some of the analysis said nash would be wasted in the triangle. nash would have been a spot up shooters and a very good one. we would have won more games and the only thing we would be worrying about is defence
Get your foot off the boat::I honestly believe they would be over .500 if Kobe had been injured instead of Nash at the beginning of the season.  There is better ball movement when he is off the floor, Nash would have developed better chemistry with Gasol and Dwight and everyone would have enjoyed playing.
desmond240::nash can't run the offence , if you don't use him for what strength he has he would be useless , d'antoni is not a good fit for this team . phil would have used nash as a spot up shooter more
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Just stop. LOL.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::I dont think so, but you never know for sure.  The issues between Dwight and the rest of the team could have still emerged... I dont know...
jrosborough08::Kobe is a 17 year Vet:  -  15 time  All-Star ( a record) - 12 time All-Defensive team - 7 NBA time NBA Finals appearance - 5 rings - 4 time Scoring Leader - 3 time All-Star MVP - 1 time NBA MVP (should have won 2)  The only players to have better numbers are either IN the H of F, are going!!  So Clippers fans relish this year... the history of all their players can't combine to beat these numbers!!  Miami will probably win this year; LeBron has been the top guy, and will be one the next 5 years, BUT how more rings.
CLIPTNYTE::Kobe is absolutely AMAZING PLAYER the best there ever was in the NBA.. no doubt.. Just watch old film of Jordon.. you can see it..
LAisShowtime84::Since when is your mid thirties your prime Gibby?  That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.
Gibby1934::your an idiot if you think kobe is better than jordan. Just compair the numbers statisticly. Kobe is 3 years longer in the league and still hasnt caught the man that retired in the middle of his prime. probably would have won 8 in a row if he hadnt.
desmond240::kobe is fun to watch
dwade for commish::we ain't watching the same films I guess
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Not sure why lakers fans post this stuff. We know its true, no on can take it away, and your not going to convince anyone here of anything.  Just doesnt seem to serve any purpose...
Ustna9::jrosborough08 = mouth breather
jrosborough08::Only during the Lakers NBA Finals!!!
I prefer boxers over briefs::No one gives a crap about the past.  Let's focus on NOW and NOW the Lakers SUCK.  Fact.
jrosborough08::All of the above are facts as well!!
dwade for commish::hot stinkin' mess.
dwade for commish::if any team ever needed a break.......poor spoiled Lakers fans LOL
shakk88::Pathetic effort last night boys and girls!  Actually the Lakers stunk it up last night!  All that smiling and joking around after getting your $@% waxed is some what emabarrasing to us the fans but not these inept players we got.  Our management put this !$@% together so they need to fix ASAP!   Get some !$@%!$@ players in here that want to be here and can represent this proud franchise accordingly!  I see why Kobe is pissed off with this sorry %!$ group of guys!  In a way I hope they don't make the playoffs so they will be forced to blow up the damn roster!
Get your foot off the boat::And that, my friends, is the true definition of a "rant"  Passion...good use of adjectives....succinct
I prefer boxers over briefs::Just heard Lakers are trying to sign Michael Jordan.  Fact.
dwade for commish::stop that :)
dwade for commish::u could argue that the clipps and heat each have 2 players who are #1 in the league at their positions.
Vanquish78::Who is a better PG than Paul?
Gibby1934::who do the Heat have thats is number 1 at any position beside Lebron. unless your counting Lebron as being number 1 at two positions i dont see it.
Gibby1934::ill give you paul as # 1 but not Blake.
Gibby1934::wade might be top 5 sg but not even close to number 1. to inconsistent on a nightly basis to be number 1.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::I think CP3 is tough to argue against.  I guess he's had some injury issues this year (as usual) but who else is close to his level right now?
dwade for commish::the only shoe in is lebron.....maybe paul.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::You could make an argument for DWade being the best SG in the league.  Not a shoe-in, but you could argue it.
dwade for commish::thank u minni
dwade for commish::best 2 guard in the league......Flash!!!!
MinniWolves90::Wade &gt; Harden and Kobe this year, if that's what you're getting at.
MinniWolves90::Paul, Wade, and James no doubt.  Griffin is very arguable.
MinniWolves90::Defense is half the game.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::Oh, Blake was included in that?  Yeah, he's definitely not #1. Unless highlights are now a measurable stat?
Ustna9::nah...not anymore.
DodgersLakersUberAlles::That would be a pretty easy argument to win as well. No debate really.
