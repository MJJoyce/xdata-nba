Tom J::There has to be a reevaluation of Vasquez.  8 turnovers in 30 minutes is pathetic.  And for all of McLemore's athleticism, his plus-minus is awful and he got 7 points in 31 minutes tonight.  None of the guards with the exception of IT have proven that they can play night to night, so mix it up and go with the hot hand.  Also, I don't know why Salmons, Thompson, and  Thornton were even on the court.  Combined 4-18 for 12 points in 66 minutes of PT.  Ugly.
William::Should have just taken them to Seattle. Sacramento will stay a bottom feeder for years.
Bryan Quinlan::Imagine Wiggins or Parker in the Kings lineup next year!
KMike::Detroit on the road? Probably a loss unless they actually hit more of the 90 or so shots they'll be jacking up. They've got a fair amount of fantasy stat players on the roster now, which is currently they're only claim to fame. I haven't seen them play in person in five years, and they've given me no reason this year.
Commenter::Isaiah Thomas still playing at age 60.  Miracles do happen.
mark::I hope Hall Of Fame guard Isaiah Thomas has a great game tonight!
J.Singh::For everyone saying why does it matter which point guard starts...look at the turnover for Thomas and Vasquez
chris::I know Vasquez signed the big contract, but if IT@ doesn't crack the starting lineup soon-someone deserves to lose their job.
russells::Jimmer continues to rot on the bench as the Sacrameto Bee leaguers continue to sink in the river of NBA mediocrity.
PKM::2 really good teams
