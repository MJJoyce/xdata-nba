RichardtheRabbit::The only reason the Knicks have struggled recently with defense is without Felton they lack a perimeter defender which they"ll get when Shumpert and Felton come back. JR Smith works of course but Felton is in shape this year so he does make a difference.
t casey::They were struggling for the past few weeks even when Felton was in. The entire team is just not committing to defense the way they were early on. It helps to have an extra wing defender or two, but that will only help so much.
RichardtheRabbit::Melo is in the voting  for MVP. That's easy.
OrdellR::Does Royce White know that all of the other headcases out there just come to Knicks boards and talk s h i t about Melo to find relief? Maybe he should try it
Boyanime011::BOOM! 3401 Comments
SRQBetterThanYou::how many games do you think the knicks bench could win in a season?
DUANESKEE::plenty, best Bench in the Nba. Prigs,Smith,Novak, Stat, Wallace or Thomas.. Copeland come on Son!
DanNYC2108::it depends how good the bench's bench is
alexhernandezh::STAT, J.R., Prigioni, Wallace, Copeland... not too bad.  Probably a few games under .500 or if STAT is the STAT we had when he first came to the Knicks, few games above .500.
trizzo23::maybe 3 or 4 tops
SRQBetterThanYou::you a hater
S2DP44::If the Bench was the starters and they had inferior players to be the bench they are a 25 win type of team. The Knicks Bench is good, the Spurs the Clippers but none of them are playoff teams if they did not have the starting talent with it.
SRQBetterThanYou::Was Melo always this talented? Or is he just having an outlier season?
DUANESKEE::He's Matured after the Olympics, Plus  James won his Chip.
Keithsmail7::He plays considerably better after participating in Olympic activities.  I thinks it's a combination of confidence and conditioning.   There's no telling how well he would play if he didn't have the Olympics to keep him shape.
alexhernandezh::Woodson is bringing the best out of Melo, also Lebron's championship win motivates Melo.  He has no other choice but to be a team player, and he is finding out how much better it is to be one and how much better he is because of it.
DanNYC2108::he was always this talented. last year was the outlier season
Carson 124::Carmelo with another 40 point game. 3rd of the season. MVP! MVP! MVP!
Boyanime011::Melo is Overrated
Tyrice240::reaaly???you really think that
Boyanime011::He's not MVP
trizzo23::ball hog chucker if afflallo took that many he would score 60
kmoe332::hope your kidding
Tricksta8822::Anthony for MVP is pure crap. Look at stats across the board. Steals, blocks, 3's FG% FT%, rebounds, assists, points per game, etc, etc,. There are 3 other players that in almost every category have better stats than Anthony. They are Durant, Kobe and James. Durant got screwed 2 years in a row by James. I sure hope he does not get screwed this season by Anthony  for MVP.
Dave87509::I am no heat fan and no lebron fan....but anyone with half a bball brain knows he is the best player in the nba. If he doesn't win MVP again ths year it will be purely political.
DanNYC2108::How did durant get screwed over 2 years in row by James. James deserved the MVP the last two years, and he only got it once. Rose had the other one
pyi91::Please know the meaning of "Most valuable" before you open your big mouth.  The award is not called "The Best Stat Award".  Carmelo deserves to be in any conversation for MVP.
SRQBetterThanYou::maybe i'm just pessimistic, but i find it disheartening that the knicks had to rally in the 4th to beat a $@%!$@ team.  between this game, and the loss to portland amongst others, i seriously doubt that the knicks will win the championship this year.
S2DP44::Well at least the hate barometer is getting pushed back. Before the season started all the rage was they wouldn't make the playoffs or they would and it was going to be the 8th seed (where are those people now). You know when they were supposed to be too old or when Felton was too heavy, or when Melo was overrated.  Funny how the haters are the ones putting the Knicks to a standard, and how every step they take they adjust the standards. Knicks haters listen to this- keep being a doubting thomas Knicks fans don't care. After 11 bad seasons we are just trying to enjoy some good basketball. So please just shut up and go watch your team.
Tinman1188::yes of course, because upsets and close games never happen to championship teams in a 72 game season.  Great analysis
pyi91::Ant that's why they embarrased the Spurs the next night......noone can say anything...let them play the games.  Everyone thinks they're experts.
TheMagicFanGuy::They are on a seven game losing streak. The losing streak started as soon as Big Baby got hurt, who happens to be their captain and best player. They'd probably be closer to .500 with him in the lineup, as they were when he WAS healthy.
kmoe332::took miami to OT the other night. It was in Orlando and its the Nba.. A win is a win.
TheMagicFanGuy::Yes a win is a win. OT against Miami, close game with Bulls and Knicks, all without Glen Davis. I don't see many teams hanging with the best teams like this even with their BEST player out hurt. I'm not saying the Magic are a great team, but they aren't bad either.
TheMagicFanGuy::If you think the Magic are a $&amp;@$ team, then you haven't watched enough of their games. They keep it close with some of the top teams in the NBA.
SRQBetterThanYou::then why are they .333?  eventually all the breaks need to pan out. if they are such a good team, they shouldn't be winning only 1/3 of their games.
69durango::Nuggets fan likes NYK bench.  Prigioni, JR, Novak, Stats, Camby and Wallace......pretty damn good.
DUANESKEE::They're a 40 Game winner at Least.
trizzo23::hard time winning 1 game
knicksnsx::Bench alone is a 50 win team.
kmoe332::yeah not even close
TheMagicFanGuy::No... It isn't.
rcariaso::Knicks still need to prove they can beat consistently the teams they should beat. The win today helped progress that notion.
Buttblaster44::Magic suck so a win was expected
CandySparker::Melo 40
Boyanime011::I Love You
trashami cheat::It took Melo 100 shot attempts to barerly beat Magic!
pyi91::Your math and grammar is off, LOL
77cradle2grave::lol - 5 straight posts within 5 minutes and liking your own posts = loneliness   GO KNICKS!!!

trashami cheat::Nets&gt;Knicks Bobcats&gt;Knicks
trashami cheat::Knicks still suck!-FACT!
lennylen2013::Hating on the knicks won't make you feel better about yourself
JiMBOII11::Funny how Melo n Kobe have the exact #'s in ALL areas but Melo is an MVP canidate n Kobe is so-called tryin 2 break records. HYPOCRITS!!!!!
TheAvenger007::You are a terrible Knicks fan then.
S2DP44::As a guy that has defended Kobe and Melo over the years.You could of said the same thing in reverse last year. wins of the bottom line. Melo played the same way ast year and every one was hating. the Knicks improved the roster so Melo can be Melo. The lakers problem have nothing to do with Kobe. The lakers bench is horrible and Dwight is not Dwight any more physically.
SPEC1MAN::neither of them are MVP's  and im a knicks fan
NYballer6969::2 games in a row Melo is kicking out the ball more then chucking it up on double teams !  The Knicks may have a chance yet !
DUANESKEE::He's becoming a Team Player,trying to win a Chip.
richiemets7::yeah and also from wen he passes it they make one more pass limiting his assists
OmniVoid::Melo has been doing that a lot this season just at times Kidd and Novak don't make the 3s c'est la vie.
richiemets7::Chicago The City Of Starz 2013 is the g.ayest name Starz with a z u fa.ggot ur a fu.cking idiot
trashami cheat::Only Faggs think other people are!You came out the closet,huh?
JVR - Cards::It's a good movie channel!!!!
OmniVoid::Well he does root for Chicago teams LOL
8988james::23 wins thru 33 games  36 wins last season in 66 games
Fairy.Enchanted.D ildo::melo is playing great and this is why i don't understand the hate for lebron's game when he is putting even better numbers almost 9 out of 10 games and this is in regular season games where heat look like they are sleeping for most of the game. why do sports fans have to hate player of another team for no reason ?
TheMagicFanGuy::Saying LOL doesn't upset anyone. So either you're not smart enough to realize that, or you don't really know what upset means. Also, reading the Divine Comedy once in school doesn't make you smart. Plus, Gilgamesh is a pile of poorly written garbage. You're a troll, and a rather bad one at that.
8988james::Wait, so buying a sports magazine makes someone dumb? I bet youre into harry potter and 50 shades of grey
JVR - Cards::LOL
OmniVoid::Jurassic Park is Bosh's home videos LOL
OmniVoid::And I care about posters on ESPN why LOL

OmniVoid::And it's an ESPN comment board LOL I'll post as many as I please LOL
JVR - Cards::All My Children by Antonio Cromartie
OmniVoid::Arguing? LOL says the guy that got upset because all I said was I'm everywhere and nowhere at once LOL.
Tinman1188::say LOL more - clearly you don't follow strings, so maybe the people posting below you won't notice
Tinman1188::he doesn't have a version.  He's too busy arguing with people who have the same point he does
OmniVoid::Well seeing as how you posted Harry Potter and 50 Shades of Grey it doesn't sound like you can handle it LOL. Start with Gilgamesh  or The Divine Comedy for starters LOL or would you prefer some Physics theory LOL
JVR - Cards::Me, Myself, and My Hairline by Lebron James and Stephan A. Smith
8988james::So lets hear your version of literature then..
OmniVoid::No I'm into actual literature. And never said all sports magazines are dumb just ESPN LOL
JVR - Cards::Yeah me too.....wait
Tinman1188::LOL
OmniVoid::LOL
Tinman1188::you can use commas if you want - or the occasional period
OmniVoid::By the sounds of it you're the one who sounds so offended LOL. And awww did I hurt your feelings. And I'm not bashing you for being a Knicks fan I'm bashing you for being an ESPN Insidertard LOL
OmniVoid::Funny how even though I post LOL in each of my statements I still have more intelligence than an ESPN Insider LOL
Tinman1188::I get it.  You're fake-offended.   I like the Knicks.  Going to the game Monday.  You suck $@%!$.  I get it
Tinman1188::Keep saying LOL- it makes you seem smart
OmniVoid::If you consider ESPN magazine reading then sh.it you must also consider People magazine an encyclopedia LOL. I read something called books something you've never heard of LOL
Tinman1188::Reading sucks.  I agree.  I eat rocks and drink my own $@%!
OmniVoid::I wouldn't waste $30 on that trash. But goes to show how dumb you are LOL.
Tinman1188::yeah I spent $30 on a magazine subscription - that is a good reason for ridicule.  I'm sure you're fine reading big $@%!$ quarterly
OmniVoid::And you don't need to have an ESPN Insider account. Just saying.
Destruct0id::This looking like last year with all the Knick's point guards dropping like flies. Except you know, the winning part.
Quincy Miller::Pour up, brick, head shot, brick  Sit down, brick, stand up, brick  Pass out,brick, wake up, brick  Faded, brick, faded, brick    Kendrick Lamar ft. Kobe
BJSaxMan93::More like Westbrick
Celts_Patriots_Red Sox_Mavs::shomu1978 - Boston will get Miami in the first round as a 8th seed and get swept away......and we can all laugh out loud about that....okay :)  Certified troll....All I have to say
trashami cheat::Your'e a Celtics fan on a Knicks vs Magic board,who's trolling but you!
Tinman1188::Will you be here Monday night?  Because I'm going to the Knicks-Celtics game
OmniVoid::You're just further proving my point LOL thanks for your support LOL
Tinman1188::content counts, no matter how much oxygen you breathe through your mouth
OmniVoid::I'm dumb yet you're the one that keeps responding LOL.
Tinman1188::Once again, scroll up, and note that you're arguing with someone who agreed with you,  In other words, completely making up an argument,  Arguing with someone who likes the same team you do..
Tinman1188::what does it feel like to be dumb?  Do you have to fail at a few every-day tasks to realize that fact?  Like, when you tried to tie your shoes this morning, did you fail?
OmniVoid::Didn't say anything about who you were addressing LOL why don't you try again LOL
Tinman1188::MY FIRST POST IDIOT - do you not comprehend how a message board works???  Seriously???
OmniVoid::Where in your post did you address him? And where does it say I can't post on a board LOL
Tinman1188::You got mad at a Knicks fan for taking offense to an anti-Knicks fan.  You're a simpering $@%!$@% !$@%!$
Tinman1188::follow this thread- you respond to a post meant for Celtics-Patriots.  Justify your existance
OmniVoid::Fake-offended? Dude you're the one who keeps crying LOL
Tinman1188::just follow this thread, unless you simply refuse to.  Shows you took offense to a post that had nothing to do with you, yet still tried to justify if
Tinman1188::fake offended - made a mistake, acted mad when my post wasn't meant for you, then tried to justify it.  You've made yourself look pathetic
OmniVoid::LOL I know you're an ESPN insider but how much of a moron are you to take me serious. LOL it's just funny seeing you ESPN Insiders take everything so personal.
Tinman1188::you've been proven stupid.  You're arguing with a Knicks fan, on a string where I called out a Heat fan, and you took fake-offence,  Scroll up.  You seem really stupid
OmniVoid::It's a board dude LOL. You want to be more direct send a message. And a paragraph? Breh if you want beef you best be bringing a pork chop LOL
Tinman1188::I'll say it again- SCROLL UP
Tinman1188::I posted something directed toward Celts-Pats, then you jumped in and took offense, claiming I responded to you (which a 9 year-old could have determined my response was not to you), then you acted fake-offended to a response that wasn't meant for you, then you tried to justify your stupidity with a made-up beef.  So what's your point again?
OmniVoid::That I am everywhere and nowhere at once. Did you miss it the first time I posted it? Geez try to keep up you do have an Insider account after all LOL
Tinman1188::make a point then- what is your point.  State your point
OmniVoid::What fight? I was just making a point. Sad that you Penn State fans can't see it. Why don't you macrame yourself some tissue
Tinman1188::you're intimidating.  I'm no match for you.  You picked a fight where one doesn't exist, then looked at my profile to try to justify it
OmniVoid::Never said I was but your compliment would mean a lot more if you weren't a Penn State fan...
Tinman1188::wow - you told me.  Truly.  You're a badass
OmniVoid::Who knows. You could have been talking to me or you could have been a disturbed Penn State fan. Or both.
Tinman1188::wasn't talking to you.  Don't care where you end up Monday.  Try to follow the thread
OmniVoid::Who knows. I can be anywhere and nowhere at once.
Aint no thang playa::Dude, OmniVoid, you ah on fiyaah!!

Celts_Patriots_Red Sox_Mavs::Hours?? U hav never seen me in a board before today and ur calling me a natural troll?? okay lol

Welcome To NYCity312::Our 23-10 record dont think so =D
GiantsKnicksYanks::It's reassuring to see a lot of the fans supporting Stat during the game.  He's beginning to take some form and he has some good defensive plays.
OmniVoid::People just like to hate on him but fail to realize that the Knicks are 10-3 when Stat and Melo both play under Woodson
S2DP44::Well said. People love to hate on the Knicks.
Celts_Patriots_Red Sox_Mavs::1st seed New York vs 8th seed Bucks 4-2 New York 2nd seed Brookyn  vs 7th seed Chicago   4-3 Chicago 3rd seed Boston    vs  6th seed Indiana   4-2  Boston 4th seed  Miami   vs 5th   seed  Hawks   4-2  Miami  Second Round 1st seed New York vs 4th seed Miami  4-3 New York 3rd seed Boston vs 7th seed Chicago  4-3 Boston  ECF New York vs Boston

OmniVoid::You have the Celtics too high LOL
shomu1978::Boston will get Miami in the first round as a 8th seed and get swept away......and we can all laugh out loud about that....okay :)
Celts_Patriots_Red Sox_Mavs::Just beat Miami in the 2nd round okay lol
GiantsKnicksYanks::Boston are the New York Giants of the NBA, they'll turn it on like they did last year,
shomu1978::Boston won 1 ring since the 80s.....big deal....so did Dallas....doesn't make them a sure thing for this season...... Knicks vs Miami....Boston will watch it on TV after the first round
GiantsKnicksYanks::Relax bud, my point is Boston can easily become one of the best teams when they want to be, don't doubt Doc Rivers,
shomu1978::What happened to the Giants this year...they didn't even make the playoffs
shomu1978::You are joking right.....Boston is going nowhere this year.... its Knicks vs Miami in the ECF this year......
beardonyourbush::The Knicks look shaky at times, but I gotta say, I love Woodson's confidence.
CelticsEasternConferenceChampions2010::No OmniVoid it doesn't matter. Both Chicago and NYK suck. The Celtics will expose them both come playoff time
JonChemRules::The east is a joke and should be removed.
CelticsEasternConferenceChampions2010::The Celtics are easily the #2 team in the East now that we got Bradley back. Screw Chicago and NYK they both suck
trashami cheat::Knicks suck yes,Bulls don't!
OmniVoid::Oh yeah cause the Knicks and Bulls have the luxury of being healthy LOL
Celts_Patriots_Red Sox_Mavs::Since Bradley's return, the Celtics hav allowed less than 80 points against the 3rd seed Hawks and 4th seed Pacers
beardonyourbush::Prepare to see that trend changed when the Knicks trash you on Monday.

yanks28th::Man I love the Knicks. What a season,  who would have thought that the Knicks would be in first? It seems like every decision this front office makes is gold. Chandler, Iman Shumbert, Steve Novak, Jeremy Lin, letting Lin go, Felton, Kidd, Pablo Prijoni, the list goes on and on. So many players that others overlooked or doubted, and they practically all went right.
Camaj77::Iman will solidify our team. Can't wait!
