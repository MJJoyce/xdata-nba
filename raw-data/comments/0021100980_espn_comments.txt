Soirojo::Sike $@%! the nets
Soirojo::IM A NETS FAN. SHUT THE $@%! UP
STUPID BOY4LIFE::.
rapshow19::uzoh triple double! what a champ
SB4LlFE::RaptorsJaysGiants - hahahahaha, raptors dropped to 8th spot!!! hahahaha
bmosheman::67 points versus Toronto?  Did the Nets play or did they let fans suit up for the last game?
chitownbullsinseven::I’ve been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 3 months straight now following this system. I found this system by Google searching the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for  anyone that is looking for a system that actually works and is tired of not winning your bets
PHILLIES ARE WORLD CHAMPS 2012::This was my post. The 4th post on this game. Check it if you don't believe me. Just wanted to say     I     AM       RICH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  NETS MUST LOSE. They traded their first round pick but have the top 3 picks protected if they were to win it in the lottery. They need the best odds possible to win a top 3 pick. They have already moved on and are already ready for Brooklyn. They have absolutely no shame in tanking. F the Nets! Bet the house on Toronto to win the money line.
jdp86::Great city, great fans (top half in attendance in the league), great coach with a championship, financial flexibility, a whole country of support, good young core moving forward.... and people say the Raptors need to leave the league?
jdp86::Casey proved he is a capable coach. We passed our win total from last year in 66 games and sit 14th in defensive efficiency up from 30th!  With Valanciunass, a potential top 5 pick and a free agent on the way coupled by a healthy Bargnani, I think the Raptors squeak into the playoffs next season
Kobe Bean Brick::I hope the russian owner gets thrown in jail for fixing a game....this is America, punk.
loco5125::fk is your problem?
philsense::Obvious tank job is obvious
NYturkeysandwhich13::$@%! you Raptors, Tank to the LOTTERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Toronto plays one opening day starter and blows out the nets :P
luvtherapsleafsjays::Bad season for the Raps in the W column, but good season for their compete level. They competed with the elite teams very well and given the talent level/injuries, not a lost season. Casey did a nice job coaching.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Jeremy Lamb 2012
Dave667362::I would never trade for, sign or consider any players who played for the Nets tonight for my team if i was in the position. I hope GM's across the league remember their disgrace and act accordingly.  14/52 from the floor from their starters.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Juno71 is mad the Warriors will never make the playoffs :)
juno71::let me just say this: Warriors will definitely make the playoffs before the god forsaken Raps do
RaptorsJaysGiants::joke of the year ^
gato madness::they <b>were</b> good with monta ellis and curry healthy
RaptorsJaysGiants::i've seen him play while he was with the Knicks hes a really poor mans chris bosh
juno71::have u even seen Lee play? no
RaptorsJaysGiants::Dude, How can u say Lee is good he's the Knicks trash and he didn't even lead them to the playoffs once in the weak east lmao and Bogut is injury prone
juno71::we will be better wit Curry, Lee, Bogut
RaptorsJaysGiants::still weren't a playoff team
N.Korea-is-ESPN::good games by Uzoh, Alabi, Davis, Anderson, and Forbes
Raptorsfan080::GOOD GAME RAPS/NETS. to the lottery we go! :)
SCP-173::This is how the New Jersey Nets end, Not with a bang, But a whimper.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Dwill is definately leaving NJ looking forward to see him in Dallas
juno71::RaptorsJaysGiants is mad guys, he might bust a fingernail so watch out
RaptorsJaysGiants::mad @ what u think i care about a draft pick? ur team wont make the playoffs with anthony davis
gato madness::nice way to end your nba season new jersey
RaptorsJaysGiants::they will lose dwill for sure cuz of this
gato madness::dwill doesn't want to live this nightmare again for sure
llGHOSTll::Who the heck is Ben Uzoh?
Kobe Bean Brick::I hope the Nets get fked every way from sunday. I have never seen a more pathetic team in my life.
OaktownLynx::You haven't seen the Bobcats, have you?
supreme91::Nets tanked so bad, that someone on the Raptors got a triple double lol
N.Korea-is-ESPN::how do you know they were tanking, they just suck
RaptorsJaysGiants::i hope they lose there pick and dwill :)
N.Korea-is-ESPN::Uzoh just got doused. great to see raps play hard all season hopefully they will build off and and make the playoffs next season
Dave667362::I'm sure they have a much better feeling in the change room for the future than the shameful Nets.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Yep they will unlike the Warriors who have made it once in 20 years :)
RaptorsJaysGiants::o so being on national tv is more important then you're team making the playoffs? LMAO only dub fans would say such stupid shi.t
juno71::yet we have national tv appearances every few weeks. how many you guys have the last 4 years ? :) (0)
Dave667362::At least the raptor players have some pride, and respect for the game. The Nets are a disgrace to the league. One spot in the draft will not replace your honor. The players should admit they were told to throw the game when they are tossed aside at the end of the season.
juno71::can't believe im comparing my warriors to the raptors. i shouldn't even have to stoop that low smh srry #warriornation
SB4LlFE::he's just mad because his team is outtanked and might drop down to 8th spot even with all the suckings
juno71::stop liking ur own comments
RaptorsJaysGiants::we wont be in the lottery next year u guys will whats ur point dude?

gato madness::juno is a girly name dude
juno71::we didnt have Curry, and thanks it helped create the coinflip
RiotVAN2012::Good Bye New Jersey! Time to be make a New York vs Brooklyn rivalry.
NYFranc::well, the Nets suck in jersey, they suck even more in Brooklyn.
NYFranc::come on, bruh, knicks will at least make the playoffs.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Nets still have a better team overall melo is fat and amare is always injured
RaptorsJaysGiants::Nets &gt; knicks
RaptorsJaysGiants::there still better then the knicks
NYFranc::nyc needs a real contender, not a bunch of herbs.
JasonC2264::c'mon raptors...i just want to see them outscore the nets by 50
JasonC2264::oops..thought i was watching a comedy movie until i realized this was actually an official game.
Thurmonatorr::LMAO @ Nets trying to tank!! Yall still wont be able to get that top 3 pick!! So yall are tanking for nothing chumps!!
N.Korea-is-ESPN::Congrats to Ben Uzoh, 1st Raps triple double since Alvin Williams 11 years ago. Don't say it came against the nets JV team, the nets have been a JV team for the past 3 or 4 seasons
Larke30864::Hold them below 70, Raps!

RaptorsJaysGiants::IDC we have better players then u guys if u dont think so ur delusional
SB4LlFE::the W's outtanked the raptors that game.. haha.. funny with your bold predictions for next season
RaptorsJaysGiants::we beat u guys lmao u guys r the knicks of the west 1 playoff appearence in 20 years pathetic no playoffs next year too
SB4LlFE::lol W's been playing rookies and bench players all year... and these players are better than most of the bottom dwellers's starters like the raptors
RaptorsJaysGiants::you're delusional
juno71::^ this guy's an idiot. Lee is better than any1 on the raptors, and curry bogut will be healthy next year
RaptorsJaysGiants::yep there better then the warriors for sure David Lee is the knicks garbage, bogut is injury prone, curry is rly good but injury prone no playoffs next year either with garbage mark jackson
SB4LlFE::didn't the W's r@ped the Kings without Bogut and Curry after they traded Monta and Ekpe away? also didn't the w's came back twice down 21 and beat the wolves twice with all scrubs?
juno71::da $@%? kings? rockets? ur high
RaptorsJaysGiants::but ur in the western conference..Wolves,Jazz,Rockets,Kings are all better then u guys lmao btw add JV our #5 pick last year who would've been taken #2 overall this year to the mix.

harvardcrimson1946::No cause the nets threw this game away
RaptorsJaysGiants::not with a garbage pick
Kobe Bean Brick::FBI...investigate this Russian b,i,t,c,h in our country.
harvardcrimson1946::NBA should investigate the soon to be Brooklyn nets for obviously tanking and throwing the game away
juno71::43 at the end of the third quarter??? LMAO
juno71::Raptors Warriors coinflip here we come!
RaptorsJaysGiants::@juno warriors will never make the playoffs
SB4LlFE::haha watch the raptors fall down to 8th spot
juno71::umad?
RaptorsJaysGiants::warriors r garbage
Robdee999::I only came here because I seen the score at the bottom of the screen and thought it was a typo.
Kobe Bean Brick::I swear to God...I was rooting for Brooklyn....never again. I hope they lose every game.
