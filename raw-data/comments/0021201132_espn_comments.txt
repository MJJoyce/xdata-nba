twinsfanforlife9566::Luke Ridnour has no business being on an nba roster, and starting him is a complete joke
MinniWolves90::At least he can shoot, that's more than you can say about most of the guys on the team.
Fan of Underdogs 2012::I feel like next year will be the year the Wolves finally sneak back into the playoffs.  I don't see them being top 5.  I'm thinking more like a 7 or 8 seed, MAYBE a 6 seed if they really push themselves.  Either way, sense of urgency will be key to getting there and keeping Kevin Love in town.
EOswede::It would have been this year if they could actually stay healthy.
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::What if the Raptors get Paul Millsap or Al Jefferson this summer.  Starters: Lowry DeRozan Gay Millsap Or Jefferson JVal and Amir, Ross, Anderson of the bench.
GaspoMinnyFan981::That would be a good lineup
GaspoMinnyFan981::Yeah I agree on that they keep Favors and Jefferson
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::I hope Jazz signs Jefferson and Favors, so Millsap can come to Raptors. Jazz will only sign  2 of their bigs, Favors will be signed for sure.
Sir Mittens the ninth::anyone know of any exp shooting guards playing in Europe that we could sign??? What about signing Vitaly Fridzon, he seemed alright in the olympics for Russia???
makar130::Fridzon is very good but he`s not NBA style player....
wunderrr::Robin Benzing from Bayern Munich, 6'8 SF, talented 24yr, great shooter, athletic...wouldve played for Michigan
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Wolves should trade Derrick Williams for Thunder Draft pick. OKC has Raps pick. that's a 6-10 pick range
GaspoMinnyFan981::Trade dwill and a draft pick for a talented Sg
Fan of Underdogs 2012::they're gonna have to do something then.  I only wish kirilenko were younger, then I would say absolutely keep him.  I don't know who to choose to get rid of, a proven solid, but aging veteran in AK47, or a youthful, underachieving Williams.
frnorth::then you just move the problem from SG to SF and we're still down a wing
Fan of Underdogs 2012::that might work, maybe even throw in kirilenko.  don't get me wrong I like kirilenko, but he's getting up there in age.
Fan of Underdogs 2012::I don't think any team would be willing to give away a top 10 pick for Williams.. his value has dropped quite a bit since he entered the league.
frnorth::he's been playing better (this game not withstanding,) and Derrick Williams and a lottery pick should buy a lot in this week draft.
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::OKC would..They need of the bench SF, not a another prospect in their squad.
GaspoMinnyFan981::It's Oladipo or bust for the wolves
frnorth::He is the guy I would love to see in a Wolves jersey.
frnorth::Imagine this Wolves team with Kevin Love and a real SG...
RavensMNWild::Imagine Kevin Love gone... Not having him on the bench the whole year for a broken hand....
frnorth::If you're removing K Love from the equations you're going to have to tell me what you're replacing him with otherwise I want him on the court wearing a T wolves jersey. and a bleeping SG that can defend his position
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Ben McLemore would be nice
GaspoMinnyFan981::This draft class is so weak
frnorth::I would take JJ Redick or OJ Mayo for sure.
RavensMNWild::I just want Oladipo..
Sir Mittens the ninth::we could always sign a good shooter FA.
GaspoMinnyFan981::I'll take him if he is left
frnorth::same   I hope Derrick Williams and a top 14 can move us up to nab him
RavensMNWild::Yes we lost!
Fan of Underdogs 2012::good and bad.  i'd like to see them win ONE more this season so Adelman can get his 1000th win out of the way, then they can lose the rest.
frnorth::Ravens, what has losing ever done for this team? Now think about that. We have lost a ton of games, name the time it actually helped.
RavensMNWild::yeaah but I wish his win would be locally televised..
Fan of Underdogs 2012::Trey Burke will be the next star to come out of college.  I like Mclemore too.
DJamesRuhere::Burke scares me as a pro prospect...Kemba Walker put up better numbers in college and led his team to title and he doesn't look like a star in NBA....Jameer Nelson also put up big numbers....6 ft. guards rarely dominate in NBA...last guy to do it is Chris Paul
Fan of Underdogs 2012::Kemba has improved a bit, and jameer has always been solid in Orlando.  I think they've done about as much as they were capable of.  That's just how it goes though, it's always hit or miss.  I hope Burke does well.
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::i like MCW
Fan of Underdogs 2012::wolves don't have much luck with Syracuse players, haha.  johnny and wes are evidence of this, however I agree that MCW will probably do much better.
D4eden::Lowry with the negative +/-. Rubio positive as usual.  No wonder Toronto can't form a descent team. Actually read fans calling Rubio a bad defender that can't shoot free throws.  He's 80% from the stripe and is tops in steals per 48 by .   Winner? Rubio.
DJamesRuhere::steals don't equate to on-ball defense....Iverson led the league in steals almost every year but was never considered an elite on ball defender
MinniWolves90::That's a great point, but Rubio <i>is</i> an elite defender.
DJamesRuhere::A lot of players have gone second overall recently and haven't become starts....Evan Turner, MKG and Derrick Williams all look like role players....drafts seem to be getting weaker every year...College basketball needs 3 year rule like college football
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Last star player to be drafted 2nd overall is Durant in 07
DJamesRuhere::exactly...been awhile
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Beasley too
DJamesRuhere::true...forgot about him
GaspoMinnyFan981::I agree
DJamesRuhere::*stars
RJaswal15::LOL @ THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LAUGHING AT ME BEFORE THE GAME BECAUSE I PUT A 50 ON THE RAPS... WON OVER 250...
Rollismith@msn.com::Hey guys, Rubio didn't lose the game.  When you have a 6'2" unatheletic 2 guard D'ing up Derozen...what the hell do you think will happen.
Rollismith@msn.com::Really? because a guy missed the last free throw, he's horrible?  That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Rollismith@msn.com::Not to mention JJ being horrible as a 2nd string PG.  If luke was the second string PG and not a starting SG, it would make a world of difference.
RJaswal15::Hes the one who created the free throws
little-general::He blew it with the last freethrow...
MY ROX HAVE NO TALENT::but he missed a potential tying free throw.
Fan of Underdogs 2012::Wolves don't need to make any major changes to the roster going into next season.  Just need to get healthy, and see if they can snag a SG in the draft, or trade their lottery pick away for an already solid SG.  That's literally all they need... another SG and their health.  Next year will be fun if everything falls into place.
DJamesRuhere::Love and Rubio staying healthy all year is the key
Rollismith@msn.com::When we were healthy last year, Rubio's first two games were Heat and OKC and we lost on no-calls in the final seconds.
Sir Mittens the ninth::yep, I don't get these idiots who say wolves don't have a future when it's pretty obvious we will be able to compete with the best of them.
Fan of Underdogs 2012::they don't know what they're talking about.  they'll be silenced if things go according to plan next season.  even with the ridiculous number of injuries, they're still competitive most games and will probably reach 30 wins, for what it's worth.
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Carmelo is not human 131pts in 3 games
skinnyyy::both teams make playoffs next year, good potential on both sides.
Norber28::Now Wolves, you should get Adelman his 1,000th victory, but lose both games against Utah so we can all laugh at Lakers fans.
Mikapus123::Yeah I'm down. I mean the Jazz will get destroyed too. But not as bad as the Lakers
MY ROX HAVE NO TALENT::wolves have a bleak future. we'll lose to the pistons tomorrow night.
Sir Mittens the ninth::heck no.
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::I can see Wolves getting my man Andrew Wiggins
KittyNationPride::Wiggins is that Canadian bball player
GaspoMinnyFan981::Nooooo I don't want to be the worst team next year
Sir Mittens the ninth::we winning the championship next year, don't worry gaspo.
Sir Mittens the ninth::who is that????, another draft bust?????
GarnettMoss::We will draft better next year... and trade LOVE and WILLIAMS and be good  relax
Bhens87::Who are we gonna get in the draft? I'd like oladipo or hard away and that's about it.
KittyNationPride::I want Kentavius with our Thunder pick
KittyNationPride::I hope we trade love for a really good sg or sf and then have D will start
MY ROX HAVE NO TALENT::bet you raptor fans are laughing at the wolves. we lose to toronto all the time. bleak future for the wolves.
Rollismith@msn.com::Yeah, we just have a top 10 player who is injured, no biggy.
GarnettMoss::who cares........
Bhens87::You know wolves if you are going to lose every time for whatever reason in Toronto least you could do is best them at home. Rubio has improved but his FT shooting still sucks. Won't mean much in big picture but that's a bad bad loss.
Bhens87::Its bad because with most of the team healthy you need to win these games to prove you can be consistent...haven't won 3 in a row since December. If your thinking it helps their draft position it doesn't. Bad draft this year.
Sir Mittens the ninth::how's it a bad loss???? the wolves aren't making the playoffs.
Sir Mittens the ninth::at least the Wolves are improving, there's nothing to blame on rubio.
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Rubio is just like Calderon, too passive and can't play Defense..Atleast Jose can make free throws
Rollismith@msn.com::Then once again, you guys don't watch games.  Rubio doesn't get "burned" more than any other PG in the league.  You point is invalid because you don't know anything about this subject.
DJamesRuhere::Steals don't equate to on-ball defense...Iverson led the league in steals almost every year but wasn't an elite on-ball defender
Rollismith@msn.com::Can't play defense? do you watch the NBA?  dude is 2nd in steals and always has great position.
little-general::Every guard he is supposed to guard blows by him.
Mikapus123::He is second in the league in steals. And if you watched more than one game you would  know he is an above average on ball defender
Norber28::Not to mention he takes charges.
eliasfcb10::lol Lowry is better? omg! it doesn't make sense
KittyNationPride::DJamesRuhere - we got a better front court with Drummond and Monroe  I'll take Love and Pek over that x9000
DJamesRuhere::U guys need a veteran/winner....Rubio is more flash than substance to me and can't play D
KittyNationPride::He's first in steals. He's actually excellent on d
DJamesRuhere::see my question below and tell me if you'd make that move as a Wolves fan
KittyNationPride::That'd be interesting. Honestly I'd rather trade our lotto for a scoring SF. I love Rubio and Rondo is got, but I prefer Rubio
DJamesRuhere::I agree...I was thinking u were a Raptors fans
KittyNationPride::Oh- Yeah you guys have a better front court. Lol
DJamesRuhere::Wolves' fans, would u trade your 2013 Lottery pick for Rajon Rondo? I would cus I don't trust Khan...I'd trade Rubio for a scoring SF and move forward with Rondo and Love
Fan of Underdogs 2012::no.  rondo's got 5 years on Rubio and he just tore his acl.  in a couple years rondo will probably begin to decline.
DJamesRuhere::I think he'll get back to 100%....he's a better defender than Rubio and makes his teammates better....Guy is a winner who will take wolves to playoffs
adam2121::I love Rondo's game but I don't want him on my team.  He would have to change his face first.
MY ROX HAVE NO TALENT::rubio is a terrible player doesn't know how to shoot free throws.
Mikapus123::Shaq doesn't know how to shoot free throws. Is he a horrible player too?
DJamesRuhere::I agree he's more flash than substance...can't shoot or play D
Fan of Underdogs 2012::can't play defense?  Rubio is the best defensive player on the team.  do you not know anything about basketball?
eliasfcb10::WTF!!?? he's the best player in Minnesota, Can you do it better?
Fan of Underdogs 2012::what a handyt.ard
enceladusMonster::hell yeaah torontoooo :d
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::GG Wolves..I wanted a Rudy Game Winner but Rubio missed ft,
MY ROX HAVE NO TALENT::bet you toronto fans are laughing at the wolves we have no talent and a bleak future. never beat the raptors.
wrex8::Well, it was a good game anyway.
Sir Mittens the ninth::wait did we have a timeout????
Norber28::What pisses me off the most is that all his struggles are a mental thing. He can shoot, but he had that terrible season in Barcelona right before his rookie season and hasn't regained confidence ever since.
Norber28::What I mean is he could have much better shooting percentages, especially from 3-pt range. I've seen him play in Spain since he was 17.
MNkittenmittens::he gets a double double nearly every game.
01AmberBock::IMO adelman SUCKS as a coach!!
01AmberBock::D. Cunningham played 28 min tonight / D. Will only 20 - game, set &amp; match!!
Fan of Underdogs 2012::how?  it's not like d-will is all that consistent.  you have to earn more playing time.
Fan of Underdogs 2012::it's hard to be successful as a coach when you're missing half of your team for most of the season... most of them being your best players.
GarnettMoss::he has had no team all year
Chawks116::Good Game T wolves, sorry he missed that
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::Yeah that's game
Sir Mittens the ninth::damn, Ricky learn how to shoot.
Rollismith@msn.com::damn, everyone else in the NBA, learn how to pass and play defense like Rubio.
phil80804::He's the only reason we were even in the game.
nietoadrian::ohhhhhhhhh, another day
PoRtEr_24::noooooooooo
phil80804::Got a little unlucky at the end. No big deal we get a better pick position now.
artraider2001::rubio you better make it!
MNkittenmittens::aye aye aye, rubio.
DJamesRuhere::worse GM? Khan or Dumars?
adam2121::GG.  Rubio is looking better but his shot is still flatter than Bin Laden's EKG.
Canucks_Nation::Game over Raptors win, raptors win
ignasm::choke
Sir Mittens the ninth::chock
Norber28::Damnit.
