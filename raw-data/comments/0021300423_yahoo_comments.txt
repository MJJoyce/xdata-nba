Anton::What a game. Jeff Teague is underrated probably a top 10 pg in talent alone. Hawks have a good starting 5 but they need a bench to make it deep. Cavs should start Anderson over Bynum and Bennett over Clark.
Amir::2 Eastern teams deserve playoffs, Hawks and similar garbage will be there so Pacers and Heats can go conference finals with fresh legs.
Sense::As someone said earlier, Mike Brown is not the man for the job.  They want LeBron back, Mike Brown better not be around.  Not that LBJ is coming back.  He could win 4-5-6 in Miami. never happen unless Bynum shows up and Brown is gone. Erving and six to's, many at critical times in the game, is unacceptable.  Totally unacceptable. Varajao is a stud, the best player on the team.
J::I'm a Cleveland fan and all, but this one is already over. Go Hawks!
Commenter::Everyone in Cleveland got Obama Phone.
- LJ::accept it w/out bennett the cavs is boring... this matiny idol a.k.a nba playboy has the looks, the perfect body and the skin... cavs will not be in any nba conversation w/out the super rookie goodlooking top overall pick and future mvp anthony the beast bennett!!!
Commenter::Romney he sucks. Everyone in Cleveland got Obama Phone, welfare, social security, food stamps, Romney he sucks. Just quotes from one of Cleveland's many intellectual democrats.
Loosie::having this be the only game on right now makes me wish my mom had aborted me after all...
jeps::give varejao more playing time
