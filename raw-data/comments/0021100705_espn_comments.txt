SherlockHolmes10889::GO SIXERS
Dave6673::My buddy got all excited to tell me Garnett had 14 points and 5 boards in the first half. Per usual, Garnett was non-existent in the second half making 3 shots.....To finish with another generic 20 point night when his team needed more....
oreed luv his redsox::sixers are lucky, celtics lost focus after seeing PIETRUS go down, .it look like they didn't care..... don't blame them ..... to many brutal injuries  and we lost bradley,
redsoxfan4ever2009::That's like the 2nd time in a month, That the C's could have moved into 1st place if they won down in Philly.
oreed luv his redsox::its sure could get ugly for my celtics this april they are mostly playing teams over 500.
WarriorsWarrior::Thoughts and prayers MP!!  -Warrior Family!
Dwayne_Johnson23::Thank you
meliy2007::Bostonn Celtics....We have to play hard or go home????????Where you want to be                                       From your fan MELIY
Dwayne_Johnson23::17 assists is amazing Rondo, but we needed you to score too.  Why can't you be a complete player more consistently?
rackem_smackemm::because he isn't. and that's the core of the problem
Dwayne_Johnson23::Indeed
kozmeal::elton brand 20 points? is that a typo?
Odens Knees::he has played well lately. He was really the only reason we had a chance against Knicks after going 0-14 to start game.
MGBell512::this was a huge win for the sixers. they really needed it
JK Belvi 2008::Isn't Pierce due for another "his head nearly smacked the floor" Pietrus-type injury like the knee episode in the playoffs?
mattschu17::it hurts but save the drama
What Just Happened 14.0::.....Yeah because when you have doctors diagnosing the injury, it's totally fake.
mattschu17::Pietrus is fine. tried to act like it was bigger than it was. soccer to the max. he gets elbowed on accident harder in practice. but got embarrassed and finished the drama.
AIadvocate::Nice win Sixers, heart goes out to Pietrus hope he's alright in the long-run...Sixers just match up well against the Celtics.  The problem is we don't match up against the Knicks/Heat/Magic well at all..Chicago we can beat or at least push to 6-7
allroy1313::Heat would be tough to beat, but Magic are streaky enough to lose to anybody.  I think the Sixers would beat NY in a series; they played one of their worst games of the season against them last time and still almost won. Of course, the Knicks have to make the playoffs first.
vivek.bara06::Get Well soon Mickael Pietrus an amazing basket ball player and a person with a good sense of humor, http://liveoncampus.com/wire/show/3361108 Mickael Pietrus shows us around his home island.
DaftShadow::looks like danny ainge not pulling the trigger before the trade deadline is backfiring on him. with 4 stars and the celtics have a 25-22 record???
nahhb::nba draft, all nba players are eligible where would u guys put pierce? this site had him 29th, seemed too low http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/
FlyGuys623::r.i.p trayvon martin
BigDeskFan69::People are ridiculous on that board... on both sides of the argument.
Davdave21::Daniels is booty I would put juwon over him anytime and he the rookie....This is the best line up for the Celtics without ray Steimsma Garnett Pierce Rondo and avery Bradley... You can rotate steimsa and bradly and with bass and juwon.... with no pietris or allen pierce takes a pf/sg approach This line up forces boston to rebound
Davdave21::With allen healthy he would def be in the line up letting bradley sub for him for a crazy defense
littlebabylalash::At one stage early in the 4th, i saw the Celtics were shooting 50% but were down by 15 points.......I thought they are a good defensive team...LOL, clealry  This team will be a sad first round exit........They should have rebuilt
FalknerX::celtics refusal to rebuild is costing them. this team is a fossil.
msaad83::The celtics are all done they should have made some moves at the deadline. It comes down to the bulls and heat in the east no other teams really have a chance. In the west its the thunder (though they turn the ball over too much) the spurs and the team I see in the finals the lakers. Sessions really puts that team over the hump. With bryant and the bigs gasol and bynum and now a quick smart good shooting guard they are dangerous.
oreed luv his redsox::Sessions is a bum lakers will get owned just like last year
rustyburg::Good win Sixers...but will Malik Rose be punished for his "insensitive" comments following the Pietrus injury?  Rose is AWESOME, but he kind of went over the line there!
BigDeskFan69::It did look like he was faking it at first
ddolph2822::no because it looked fishy at first.
Ray Allen Fan91::http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/detail.nhn?titleId=350217&amp;no=31&amp;weekday=tue  Read it, you will $@%! brix
Thomas4889::MVP= Kevin Darant......DPOY= Queen James.....6th Man=Lou Williams.......ROTY= Kyrie Irving........COTY=Tom Thibodeau
GBM04::queen??
KENNY-----------POWERS::DPOY= DWIGHT HOWARD
Petro19::bottom line is that the entire NBA is watered down with the exception of a few teams. the sixers are not as good as their record would indicate. It will be the thunder v bulls in the finals. sixers will get bounced in the first round -
rustyburg::Petro has little basketball knowledge, the basis of his comments is solely on the fact that he doesn't "know" and of the Sixers names.
killahs_ghost::One and done to who? The Pacers? The Hawks?  We could make some noise. Best D in the NBA is worth something. Don't sell it so short.
GBM04::The Celtics will not make the playoffs.
NoThanks2U_8::This might be a 1st round match-up, could be fun see
Matttide::as a sixers fan, i would love to get the Celtics. We're so much younger and more athletic, we'll run them off the court.
falseprophet2012::how many players can the Celtics lose in a season? Does not look good for this team at all. They may miss the playoffs, especially with all these injuries and one of the worst benches in the league.
BigDeskFan69::Anyone else's computer acting wack on this board?
IggyIsNotClutch::I almost cried when Doug started to cry but then he started to stick out his tongue...
TheDynastyBball::NBA made sure to help the Sixers compete by making each of the three Celtic-Sixers game a second of the back-to-back for Boston while giving Phily a 2-3 days rest before each game....nice going NBA. And yet the Sixers might still prove not good enough with all the Celtic injuries and NBA scheduling manipulation for the Boston-Phily games.
the_jonz::you're right, there's SUCH A CONSPIRACY!
Korzagg::Nice try the sixers just played last night and only had 1 night off before the other 2 games
mj8648::excuses....
keuntae22::$@%!
leerey14::DC CRYIN

IggyIsNotClutch::Hope he gets well soon
FlyGuys623::damn. tough luck
OzzyRomo::Season is not ove yet...just let us get healthy then we will see was up. Go Boston Celtics

FlyGuys623::getting iggy wit it
FlyGuys623::i try my best to make bad jokes;)
BigDeskFan69::that would be so corny hahaha
J-SMOOVE2036::pietrus is done
ang.1::they were the better team because bradley and pietrus went down. daniels and dooling couldnt defend a fat kid with a broken leg.
leerey14::Pietrus probably faked injury to get off that celtics roster. I know i would.
randymossallday::spinal contusion, ouch.
BigDeskFan69::Little to far man... he looked messed up.
OzzyRomo::GOOD Game philly but this not over yet we will me again...get well Pietrus we need u back.

StopESPN-CENSORSHIP::We could all learn from this
AllStar1771::LOL.
Luclongley_MVP::Boston will be a sub .500 team by the end of the season.
leerey14::god damn espn has a $@%! load of future comedians.
NewEnglandSportsFanNH::The Philly was a better team tonight they deserved the win, but more important I hope Pietrus is all right
AllStar1771::Philly SHOULD have won this game tonight.  Not necessary to shoot off confetti.
BigDeskFan69::Blah blah. the celts have more championships therefore you are a better person... sdjagbjksdgbkj
AllStar1771::Well, before this year, they must have had lots of confetti left over then!
FlyGuys623::they do it every game. get over it
BigDeskFan69::Yea. He looked messed up.
FlyGuys623::same here. good luck
CELTICS GETTING READY FOR THEIR FACIAL NOW::I heard the Celtics were considering moving to Anaheim
the_jonz::omg that would be worse than the Kings if they had moved here. No way in hell that's gonna happen though; WHY would the Lakers' rival move just down the street, relatively speaking?   OzzyRomo, where in Anaheim do you live?
OzzyRomo::Were did u hear some dum  like that I live in anaheim bro
