razzledazzletj81::All-Star Stephen Curry is the only player in the NBA to be in Top 10 for ft % and 3 pt %.  Q:Who would be the only other the player in the league to do this if he had enough touches to get to the line? A: The entire Kings line-up not named Jimmer.

SpursManiac4Ever::Sorry, but that's your role...need a gun?
SpursManiac4Ever::Don't you hate nurse Ratchet forcing you to take your meds... and giving you enemas?
Only real fans stick with bad teams::U guys realize that if u didn't respond to slam he would probably commit suicide right?? He's obviously got nothing else to offer the world other than trolling Spurs threads on ESPN.....but I get it....too easy to make fun of this guy....touche.....
SpursManiac4Ever::He is the resident fool...we gotta make fun of him..
SpursManiac4Ever::Stern is beside himself; his henchmen stole the game from the Warriors, and Kobe's achilles was the price.... awwww, poor baby !!!
SpursManiac4Ever::LOL I just saw a promo for the Lakers v Rockets game and it said "Kobe will will the Lakers into the playoffs....  Ooooops !!!

slam_dunk_on_u::BTw the most stupid move the spurts did today was...Waiving the enforcer.....SJax....Popazit was denied of a BJ probably LOL
77Bruce2150::SANITARIUM and ASYLUM. Yep, that's more than right.
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Pop a zit????? How old r u dude like 4?? Seriously bro u sound like one of those guys who lives their whole life in their mom's basement
SpursManiac4Ever::No, in a sanitarium....
77Bruce2150::I'm okay with that. Jack helped us get rid of RJ. Kawhi is gonna play more and prove himself with no objections and obstacles.
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Laughing at your own jokes is cool
SpursManiac4Ever::You are an expert on those aren't you Slam?
SpursManiac4Ever::Everybody notice how Slam NEVER responds to me? I intimidate him !!!  LOL
slam_dunk_on_u::so who you rather play spurts....Warriors or Rockets....the lakers will be 8th. too bad you dont have to play them without Kobe...Karma...sons Karma....
77Bruce2150::I want us to get the first seed so we can wipe the floor with your Lakers who looks like they 're gonna play without Kobe now. That is if they still want to fight for a playoffs spot.
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Kobe's career is over. FACT
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Making fun of another team becuz they won't have the chance to destroy u.....good one

slam_dunk_on_u::I thought so
SpursManiac4Ever::You can't bet from the sanitarium fool !!! What are you gonna bet? Your bed pan?
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Sounds like something an 8 yr old would say
kobe fakes injuries fact::I've never hated kobe more than I do now. This guy has faked several injuries this season, only to "miraculously come back".  This is nothing. Kobe is faking it. He will be back in the playoffs. He will be suddenly healed. Kobe fanboys will slurp him and awe at how kobe is a warrior but the truth is <b> Kobe fakes injuries</b>
slam_dunk_on_u::Hi spurzwartz
kobe fakes injuries fact::this is spurs owns lakerheads.
Only real fans stick with bad teams::He's got a great pro wrestling career ahead of him
slam_dunk_on_u::Kobe does not  fake injuries..he is a warrior!  Parker, Duncon and Ginoflopping are a bunch of wussies....
SpursManiac4Ever::I thought he was a Flaker???  WTF?   And you don't know anything about "wussies" so stop trying to convince us you do
Cowboys N Spurs Dynasty::Kobe is still faking injuries. Nothing new here
kobe fakes injuries fact::^
slam_dunk_on_u::Popazit is probably fuming right now....trying to avoid the lakers in fisrt round ...while the Thunder is smiling....

slam_dunk_on_u::but still behind the thunder moron
slam_dunk_on_u::Damn! we should have not tanked all those games.....<i>Spurts team</i>  Hey wasssup Lakers!  <i>Durant</i>
77Bruce2150::Slam's Heart is shattered into PIECES. #KobeInjury.
SpursManiac4Ever::too bad it isn't his head....   :o)
SpursManiac4Ever::Btw; where are you going fishing?  So I don't go there.....
SpursManiac4Ever::Why aren't you at the hospital with your idol?
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Good point
texican_11::?
kobe fakes injuries fact::<b> hey guess what, td4mvp3 wants to slurp kobe with you!</b>
SpursManiac4Ever::I don't know man; Slam don't share...
kobe fakes injuries fact::<b> By the way td4mvp3, you can stay with the other kobe slurpers</b>
Only real fans stick with bad teams::LOL
SpursManiac4Ever::That's a truer statement than you might think... I mean look at Cubs, Wizards, Bobcats......
77Bruce2150::If Kobe is shelved for the season THEN I want the SPURS to get the number one seed !  No way they beat us on SUN even if it's going to be played at Staples center.
SpursManiac4Ever::Yeah 77; I replied too quick before I realized we're on the same side..my bad
SpursManiac4Ever::Who is us? The Flakers? Get outta here with that...we were gonna win with or without Kobme in the lineup
77Bruce2150::I agree, my man. With Kobe, there was a slim chance they beat us in their gym. Without him, slim to NONE.
joemcleod83::Doesnt matter. OKC will almost certainly win last 2 games anyways
77Bruce2150::If the Thunder becomes the no. 1 seed, they will get a free pass in the first rd if a Kobe-less Lakers team qualifies for the last spot. I most certainly don't want that for OKC.
SpursManiac4Ever::Anything can happen, and usually does...
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Coming from a Kings fan who saw the refs single handedly take a title away from the 2002 Kings to Kobe's Los Angeles Referees I could care less about this career ending injury (hopefully). I hope this starts a curse in L.A. worse than the Chicago Cubs have ever even dreamed of...
SpursManiac4Ever::The curse of the rapist !!! I like it !!
kobe fakes injuries fact::<b> you are an honorary spurs fan</b>
kobe fakes injuries fact::<b> thank you, I am a kings fan everytime they play the lakers</b>
Only real fans stick with bad teams::I like the Kings, but a HUGE Spurs fan anytime they play the Lakers :)
kobe fakes injuries fact::<b>sup howdythere this is spurs owns lakerz</b>
SpursManiac4Ever::What up Spurs fans? Just heard about Kobe.... somehow I can't help but think that karma has finally caught up to the "rapist".... buh bye... no tears here
kobe fakes injuries fact::<b> this is what real spurs fans reactions should be^^^  not like the traitor td4mvp3</b>
kobe fakes injuries fact::<b> attention spurs fan: there is an spurs fan who is also an undercover lakers fan: td4mvp3  he is at the lakers article supporting kobe and deflecting any insult from kobe to other players  this is a warning to true spurs fans</b>
SpursManiac4Ever::Really? Is there definite proof? I mean he could just be misguided feeling sorry for Kobe
kobe fakes injuries fact::<b> no, go to the article now. He doesn't want anyone to insult kobe. He deflects any insulting post with a comment about lebron or durant</b>
MidnightMary0320::ESPN is in mourning; their idol, Kobme, is down for the count.
MidnightMary0320::Guess Slam face will also be in mourning, and have no shortage of excuses of why they don't make the playoffs. Because they won't beat the Spurs on Sunday.
SpursManiac4Ever::He's probably at the hospital holding a candlelight vigil,,,  LOL
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Let the celebration begin!!!
kobe loves to fake injuries::<b> attention spurs fans: I have discovered a fake laker fan disguising as a spurs fan  Td4mvp3 is an undercover laker fan</b>
MidnightMary0320::interesting
MidnightMary0320::How do you know...
kobe loves to fake injuries::he is on the new article trying to deflect any insults from kobe, wishing kobe luck and sticks to only bashing lebron
MidnightMary0320::Ok, let's get real here: Anybody who doesn't believe in "fixes" in the NBA did not watch tonight's Lakers v Warriors tonight. Unbelievable. They couldn't be more obvious if they just awarded the game without playing it to the Lakers. I thinbk it was like 50 FT's to around 15 in the Lakers favor, including some real doozies, and one where the wrong person (Blake) got sent to the line smh
SpursManiac4Ever::I know; I could not believe what I saw... watched the last quarter and a half...it was unbelievable the way the refs were calling that game and keeping a straight face to boot... somebody should launch an investigation. But they won't because Stern is running this fiasco.
Only real fans stick with bad teams::It's already been proven. Tim Donaghy 2002 Lakers Kings end of story
razzledazzletj81::The Kings best shooter took two shots in the 4th, great coaching.
MidnightMary0320::LOL...good point.
howdythere81::Did Kobe tear his acl!?
MidnightMary0320::No, his achilles
77Bruce2150::Kobe might be done for the season ! http://nba.si.com/2013/04/13/kobe-bryant-achilles-injury-lakers-warriors/?eref=sihp
77Bruce2150::It's another Spurs win !  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1kVN4ENyo0
kirt0202::Either Jack really pizzed off some teammates and coaches, or Pop is very confindent manu and parker will be full strength for the playoffs. Jack was a head case but no doubt one of our stronger bench players.
packa83wolf4urTrip::in a game where the kings lose by 7, fredette in his 20+ min was +6... enough said..... but in case u want more, he shot 5 for 7 for 14 points 2 for 3 three point range....  meanwhile isiah thomas was 3 for 10, and tyreke evans was 3 for 9.... it is a travesty that fredette has been stuck playing for this piece of trash coach for his first two years.... hopefully he gets the hell away from smart (how ironic) and this whole pathetic selfish squad
itsatrap13::Please, post this again. I didn't get you the first 100,000 times you complained about this. Maybe if you post this 100,000 more times he'll play.
Hondo Kid::diaw and manu out.  so lets dump jackson right before the playoffs.   okey dooekey
howdythere81::I know jack didn't have stellar numbers but he brought toughness every game that and his  d was enough for me
Darkest_Monkey::I don't know what was going on off the court, but it seems like a bad move. Without Parker and Ginobili, with the exception of Duncan and Leonard, the Spurs have looked awful...thought his toughness and shooting could have helped in the playoffs. I know he hasn't had a great year, but Spurs fans know they're not going to get anything from Bonner come playoff time, and Neal has been really off lately...a few of those games against OKC in the playoffs last year he was the only one to go out there and make some crucial buckets. I hope I'm wrong, though.
howdythere81::well your prob right I just liked the dude no worries
texican_11::Everyone is upset just because hes Jack, but he wasn't even Jack this year, he was super slow turned the ball over way to much and his 3s wer off. We should have traded him before the deadline. Not sayn I think it was a good move dropn him but we don't really need him.
howdythere81::I don't understand that either loved jacks d and fire
texican_11::He played like straight trash all year, what was his highest scoring game this year like 10 pts? we don't need him...... Leonard will play 40mins a game in the playoffs
UTRA_modsarescaredofme::Tony did work on his first game back
howdythere81::Tony is key hope his injuries are ok and he reverts to that MVP form he had before the ankle
texican_11::22 and 10 not to chubby
UTRA_modsarescaredofme::Tony work on his first game back
texican_11::Spurs fans we will be just fine Manu will be back and with Jax gone pop is guna unleash Leonard and we will see the big 4 do some work!! The only team we really need to worry about in the west is okc, the others are pretenders
Chrisp722_NY1::Tim Duncan is such a bad*ss
howdythere81::Duncan turning back the clock lately
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Best PF of all-time
