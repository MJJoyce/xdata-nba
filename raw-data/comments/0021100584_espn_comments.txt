tank_dogg06::I've tried to tell people that you have to be patient with ET. He is the type of player that improves over the course of multiple seasons. Some were already writing him off as a bust. Not even close to the case. He wasn't a star his Freshman year at OSU. He exploded in his 2nd season and took that role.
phunky58::even turner startin to turn it up like he is definitely capable of.
Fendretti4::I didn't watch this game but judging by the stats, it looks like good things happened for the sixers. Looks like they played through Iggy, which is how it should be. Evan Turner started and played a lot and well. Meeks didn't play a lot, im not a fan. He's a streaky shooter and is not hot more often than he is hot. I like Brand, but not shooting more than 8 times a game. He's too old to play that much. Do need to see more Lavoy Allen
KennyS562::This Jazz team is frustrating! They aren't that good, yet they are trying to compete for the 8th seed to only get blown out.
IggyIsNotClutch::Lets Go Sixers!
CandySparker::Evan Get it on!
Blazelover13::The turnovers were a tad high in this game, and the free-thrown percentage is a little low for my liking, but otherwise another impressive performance. Balanced attack without a stupid superstar hogging the ball, like a certain player in Los Angeles, and that's good to see. Once Hawes gets back, this team will start to easily dominate again. They're 12-2 with him, and 12-15 without him. What does that tell you? Can't wait until this Sixers team gets rolling, all the way to the finals!
mortman13::Let's talk reality  We still need a superstar player if we are gonna have any chance in the playoffs.
Ultras South::No surprise here.
Riche730::look out Malik were comin in for a landing!
dylan2735::Iggy and turner take over! Would like to see iggy shoot more he was perfect tonight on shooting and flirted with another triple double
TattersawContractor999::Live in warr acres OK. Got this from a  friend Ricky Rubios cell (570) 848-3255. Call before he changes it

robkaos::Yeah, Ricky Rubio really lives in PA..
clingerk::TRADE BELL PLEASE!!!!!! hes such a waste of space on this jazz team
KennyS562::How about C.J Miles, Milsap, and Harris as well?  Let's play the youngsters and let them develop!
ncarter5889::wow 43 minutes for turner
salemram15::He's been straight ballin. He's like a new and improved ET.
randymossallday::and he flirted with a triple double. those 43 minutes should build his confidence.
jayreed2309::two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese....
DaKing0325_::Collins played turner a little too much than he what he should though, 43 minutes is alot
deheck2::Meeks is done! he is a one trick pony that doesnt even do that one trick very well
dwnstaley::meeks didn't do too much while Turner got it going.  it's great Turner is getting more time and swagger.  if meeks was getting hot, turner would have sit or played more at the 3.
tommynoble61::dude hes the 2nd overall pick two years ago,  he flirted with a triple double, and he dropped 26 last night... i think he can play 43  minutes
Tim_Reeve91021::play the latest in fantasy sports.  Turbo fantasy:   http://bit.ly/AsQKiX
theSwayzeExpress::I love this team.  If they continue to play like this, the Bricks are toast.  Night yall
tah.adin::sixers team to beat, my team all day go sixers !
TrOEaSY42::it frightens me to say this but evan turner may be the best at ball handling, getting to the basket and finishing or creating a shot for someone else on the sixers since allen iverson
dmac456::Iverson never played on a team with this many scorers! Only if we been got a PF  before a broken down Webber! Iverson needs to comeback! Anyway, go SIXERS!
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::hes more of a team player though!
EbbNFlow88::Bout time turner started looking like that number two pick.
randymossallday::iggy is a great defender and Turner can do good things with the ball in his hands and he is unselfish. if him and iggy can co exist together and be decent shooting the ball off the ball. then we will be okay.  holiday isn't a bad shooter. hopefully he can shoot well playing off the ball in the long term because Iggy and ET will be the primary ball handlers going forward.
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::great rebounder
EbbNFlow88::agreed
robkaos::Collins finally using him right. With the ball in his hands, he can do good things.
tank_dogg06::Exactly!   Not sure why it took so long to realize that he's not an off-ball offensive player. He always had the ball in college and he needs it to max his full potential.
RylanT25::The Sixers are definitely a better team with turner starting and will be even better when hawes comes back
BigDeskFan::Wow turner is not to bad of a rebounder
salemram15::He's a great rebounder as a matter of fact.
jeffwawa::I keep hoping the Jazz will play a full four quarters, but then they sub in CJ Miles.
BarkBarkForPig::they just shouldn't play Miles on the road. At all.
adamsbrian88::He threw the offense off so bad every time it's so frustrating how he gets so much time over burks hayward howard and even bell, props though to philly defense they took care of business
bobHALO 30.1::Evan Turner just makes things happen with the ball in his hands!    GG Jazz fans.
MirBay_Watson::Solid win.  Next up...the overrated, overhyped New York Bricks.
doggto::apparently a 4 team trade is VERY NEAR that will send dwight to the lakers and nash to the raptors.... should mix up the rankings http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
DaKing0325_::Next up boys, The New York Knicks
theSwayzeExpress::Lin will be shut down by the stifling sixer's D
bluedevils1148::They're nothing special. If they weren't from New York, it wouldn't even be a big deal.
MirBay_Watson::Good D.  BIG MACS!!
theSwayzeExpress::Heck of a drive for the big macs too
robkaos::The mormons must really bring the energy out in Utah. 5-13 on the road?
BarkBarkForPig::haha yeah blame it on the refs. Act like the refs would ever favor the Jazz against the Heat
Andrew-Baugh::Just like phila did tonight..
Frank Reynolds 6::The bring their own refs out
theSwayzeExpress::One more for the free big macs, crowd on its feet
bobHALO 30.1::Turner 14 and 10... Kid is unleashed
theSwayzeExpress::Its just awesome to finally see Collins turn him loose in the starting lineup.  Its already paying dividends
theSwayzeExpress::Nice slam with some authority
BigDeskFan::"I must break you."
theSwayzeExpress::Like for the simple fact that that movie has been on my mind ever since the new episode of Eastbound and Down
BigDeskFan::haha same here
BigDeskFan:::(
MirBay_Watson::Sixers are suffering from the "can't-score-in-the-4th" disease they've been having.
bobHALO 30.1::You must be watching a different game
Andy Devendorf::Check out <strong>http://www.hoopsgrind.com</strong> for detailed basketball commentary and predictions from today's games.
PHLYGUY555::i predict a sixers win and a big mac
theSwayzeExpress::Man why is this room so dead tonight?
PHLYGUY555::i hear ya swayze
Frank Reynolds 6::It's Friday.
Frank Reynolds 6::I am too cheap to go out
theSwayzeExpress::I know I'd be out too if I was still drinkin.
PHLYGUY555::friday night
bwaterthug6969::11 pts lets go
theSwayzeExpress::Really really late whistle.  Dont think theyd have made that call if he hadnt fallen on his $@%
MirBay_Watson::C'mon with that whistle, man.
scow79::Amen.   Jazz big men are getting hacked everytime down the court
Frank Reynolds 6::What is wrong with levoy?
bluedevils1148::Nothing. Collins just stopped playing him.
EbbNFlow88::I really don't get why Vuc doesn't get more minutes...kid will develop into a good player with more experience.
EbbNFlow88::true but he's already proven he can put up some pretty good numbers with more minutes.  Double-double yesterday (granted it was a blowout), good rebounding and nearly double digit scoring every time he plays 20+ minutes.  Sure he's inconsistent, but it's what happens when you're a rookie.
PHLYGUY555::hes slow and just saying played pro leage in another country fresh outta college...not the same pro as this country
Frank Reynolds 6::But it's not like he has never played in this country and he is a rookie.
PHLYGUY555::yeah but he was playn in montenegro b4 nba lockout was over
Frank Reynolds 6::The guy played at USC that is not another country.
PHLYGUY555::hes been playn in another country...he just needs to adjust to nba speed
MagicianJohnson::Yeah same reason Kanter only gets 10 minutes a game
Frank Reynolds 6::.????
theSwayzeExpress::Good to see this team back on track.  Looks like alot of fans are gonna be eatin free big macs
MirBay_Watson::Sweet Lou with the pretty move.  Dare I say.....Big Mac push?
DaKing0325_::3 rebs for a triple double iggy
MirBay_Watson::NOW Holiday shows life.
doggto::apparently a 4 team trade is VERY NEAR that will send dwight to the lakers and nash to the raptors.... should mix up the rankings http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
