SilentRifleman::I'm convinced that Jordan is only the owner because Stern asked him to do it.  Rather than admit they screwed up by giving Charlotte a new francise, Stern gets Jordan to be the owner in the vain hope that it will generate interest and buzz in the team.  Either contract the Bobcats, or move the franchise to Seattle and rename it the Supersonics.  As an added bonus, Stern should resign.
Kev_010::pretty sure bobcats are worst than wolves.
dabulls2012::I hate when you read this or that guy "flirted with a triple-double" when they had only 7 rebounds or assists...that's only 70% of the way there...that was a low D in my high school...it kind of diminishes how truly hard it is to actually get a triple-double.
NBASantas::The Charlotte Santas have not even been fun to make fun of on NBA Santas: http://nbasantas.blogspot.com/2012/04/bad-santa.html
BigEazy_BigDance::Who still goes to that Times Warner Arena in Charlotte to watch the Bobcats play.....man this team is awful!....They are really bad....So if they go 7-59 they are officially the worst team in the league ever?
Anthony71850::Charlotte, please just fold.
BearJWS::The Bobcats luck is so bad, they won't even end up with a Top 3 pick.   You know David Stern will never allow them to have the top pick.
Drunk FedEx Driver::<b>YOURE A LITTLE BI<b></b>TCH FOR THAT BILL</b>
wizardofthewestoffense::At least at number 4 they can have one of the starting five from UK... and be in the lottery again next season.
CandySparker::Consecutive 20th Nervous Breakdown
Snakes222::How sad is it that Tyreke Evans peaked as a rookie?!?!
tmanz2007::Get rid off poor shot selection Tyreke for some decent pieces and feed Cousins the ball and you've got a west coast top tier team. Cousins is going to be one of the best bigs in the NBA next season
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::DeMarcus should score more than what he does on average.

Rhubarbjackson::I've been following your mom for 3 weeks. I have made over 3 K in free handjobs.
thedjessence::some times i wonder........................................... HOW THE $@%! ARE THEY SO BAD
mc_fine::Their top 4 highest paid players are Corey Maggette, Boris Diaw, Tyrus Thomas and DeSangana Diop... common now...
IronFist79::I hope the Bobcats lose the rest of their games so i can laugh
JujuBeanYum::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKLAzyWiC4
Deuce200361::How special Anthony Davis must feel...an NBA team and Michael Jordan as the owner willing to flush their entire season just to have the best chance to pick him number 1.....He has to feel pretty special.  What an embarrassment for the Bobcats.
Deuce200361::This Bobcat team is a disgrace to all sports.  MJs legacy is being redefined...whats he gonna do next year?  Lose every game until the draft stocks him with 5 number 1s.  There should be a minimum amount of games that you must win to qualify for the top spot in lottery balls...that would settle this crap.  You can stil be in the lottery, but you dont get as many balls...Maybe you have to win at least 20 games then you qualify if you dont you drop to 3 or 4.  The League should really step in and redefine qualifying for the most lottery balls.  I will laugh my $@% off if charlotte doesnt make the top 3
Supaman670::I know a real life Bobcats fan. Seriously
LSP24::The Bobkitties!
RZye::MJ needs to get some award for what he's done with the Bobcats. He's a true professional.
President_29::anybody know how many games are in this nba season? i'm always going to wonder if the bobcats could have set a new record for futility by tying the Sixers' 1972-73 season record of 9-73, or even doing worse...
RZye::Agreed. Too bad they didn't get the opportunity haha...
President_29::i think they could have tied the sixers. they would have had to win 3 of their final 19 games to get to 10 wins in an 82-game season.
RZye::66 games.
Sambo8964::This is what happens when you have a UNC alumnus run the Bobcats.
bobjonahbob::its amazing how much people comment on the bobcats games its almost as if they were a nba caliber team
brigadier1974::I hope this season is embarrassing to everyone in the Bobcats organization, especially Jordan. He may have been a good player and a good shoe salesman, but as an owner he is an absolute joke and an embarrassment. The extent to which he has decimated this franchise is so great, they may never recover. What a travesty.
itsatrap123::I hear Anthony Davis is regretting his 2011-2012 season.
drewkono13::The Bobcats bent over and took it up the you know what tonight.
folgersnyourcup::See my earlier post...I unfortunately attended this game.  It was evident not a single player on the Bobcats cared at all.  There was a complete and total lack of effort from every single player on the team.  Kings' players were allowed to do whatever they wanted all night.  The crowd was dead.  It was awful.  I did not pay to see this game and refuse to pay to see any future Charlotte Bobcats game after this travesty.  The Bobcats made the Kings look like worldbeaters.
SilentRifleman::Jordan cares about winning....................he's consumed by winning..................unless it cuts into his golf/Vegas time.  Or he has to pay with his own money.
Sambo8964::Well Seattle needs to get the Raptors to move from Toronto to Seattle. Seattle deserves an NBA team again. I remember when the Hornets left Charlotte for New Orleans and I've always been a Rockets fan.
PhatmanXL::not really....the  majority of people there didn't care about the Sonics leaving...Vancouver is more deserving IMO
Sonicdawg96::Wow. I'm in Seattle and we are trying to get another team. Sometimes I wonder why....
folgersnyourcup::I do see the occasional small child.  I went back and found my earlier post.  I think it sums it up perfectly.    "I will unfortunately be attending this game. I had the dubious distinction to "win" these tickets in an office drawing. It is in the office suite with free beer and food so I figured what the heck. The Bobcats DESERVE to go in the history books as the worst team of all time. Every facet of this organization, from its inception, to its current state, is an absolute joke. I cannot think of a larger disconnect between a team and its city/community than the Charlotte Bobcats and the city of Charlotte, NC. Very few people care. I will not say nobody, as this is simply not true. There are certainly season ticket holders, and on occasion I see small children wearing Bobcats merchandise. However, to have an owner who practically lives walking distance from the arena and rarely takes the time to attend games is embarrassing. It would be justice for the Bobcats to not only lose their final four games, but also not win the draft lottery. I cannot recall such blatant tanking of an entire season along with complete disregard to build a fan base."
Sonicdawg96::Do people wear Bobcats gear around Chalotte? Shirts, hats etc. Just curious.
Sambo8964::Don't know about Charlotte, but there are no Bobcats fans in the Outer Banks of North Carolina where I live at.
folgersnyourcup::lol yep!  that was me!  it was seriously that bad.
itsatrap123::Were you the guy who "won the dubious honor" to see this game? I read your post and burst out laughing...I felt so bad for you.
GrannyDanger332::I don't feel sad for them at all. I mean when you put somebody like Corey Maggete on your team you deserve to suffer,
Sambo8964::Typical Dookie!
GrannyDanger332::The Charlotte Bumcats.
DRC1981::The Bobcats are so bad at this point, that if their opponents had not have shown up for their last 4 games, they might have gone 2-2
mwgallem11::Am I the only one that thinks if the Bobcats get the #1 pick they trade back and attempt to collect more first round picks? Stacked draft afterall...
RZye::I agree with mwgallem11. Anthony Davis is not someone you're going to build a franchise around. I'd trade back to pick up some more solid players.
darkyam::Stacked draft, yes, but Anthony Davis is looking like a fairly clear #1.  I'd rather have him than take my chances on two guys later in the first round.
cjc3593::With that record will the Bobcats qualify for the WNBA playoffs?
jonny0916::Rarest headline ever - Kings romp...
who-sj::I am so glad that I do not get the bobcats on TV even though I should since I get the channel that they are on
Rhubarbjackson::Smoke two joints in the mornin.
Rhubarbjackson::Smoke two joints at night.
Rhubarbjackson::Smoke two joints in the afternoon.
knicks_11::Charlotte  CAN U PLEASE BEAT THE MAGIC ON WEDNESDAY?? ITS MY ONLY REQUEST.
lehmanator123::haha kemba walker goes from winning the National Championship to being on the worst team ever!
Sambo8964::Yeah he probably should have stayed at UCONN for his senior season.
itsatrap123::Serves him right for being a part of the worst National Championship game ever.
simpsonpower::you know it is sad when a board turns into a fight between Isiah thomas and jimmer fredette
Rhubarbjackson::Happens every game.
Sonicdawg96::I've played on YMCA pickup teams better than the Bobcats.
Miami-Jstar::can the bobcats just quit the season right now so they wont have the worst win percentage in NBA history
jonny0916::they quit the season a long time ago
Food Be Tasty::Hey Charlotte, you've locked up the worst record weeks ago, so now you can at least pretend to be an NBA team now.
folgersnyourcup::I attended this game.  They have a HYSTERICAL intro video with some nonsense about water boiling at 212 degrees but that the Bobcats play at 213 degrees...because the extra degree is effort.  Which is what they proclaim the Bobcats to have.  I promise you this...no player on the Bobcats gave a damn tonight.
lehmanator123::you've mistaken their ambition. They are trying for the worst record ever of all time.
TK729::The Bulls, Heat, and Spurs combined have less losses than the Bobcats.
Miami-Jstar::ha ha
zachzach2020::Oak Hill Academy &gt; Charlotte Bobcats
