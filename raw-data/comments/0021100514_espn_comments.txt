backwoods4::we need hockey basketball blows
ACandOJ::Nothing like playing the Cavs &amp; Bucks in tight games to get back to .500!!! Go C's!!!
14lbenson::The Bucks are gonna have a good second half of the season. Mark my words.
backwoods4::can we please get rid of the bucks and get a hockey team. this is a joke
Dwayne_Johnson23::C's!
Mr1NightStan::We need to trade Jennings and cut our losses before it's too late. No PG should be taking 7 3's in a game. Let alone one who can't shoot.
twinstj2008::I totally agree.  The problem with the NBA, as with most professional sports, is that you have one great game and your legacy is built.  The 55 point game was two years ago now and all we have gotten is a PG that shoots at less than a 40% clip and takes far far far too many 3's.  Beno is much better or even Livingston!  I also think it is time to get rid of Skiles he obviously does not know how to manage this team which should be winning much more games
bobby30303::Lin keeps winning but can he match 150 MPG? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmlTrVha3M8
Mr. Manmanman Jr.::Man you're cool lookin'.
winterfresh98::whats funnier?  Bucks or C's
Rangerswinitallagain::Eagles AKA "DREAM TEAM"
winterfresh98::*yawn*
chavezscott04@gmail.com::Ray Allen for Beasley PLEASE
Malcyon1::Keep giving this Ersan kid more minutes and I promise you Milwaukee that he will win MIP.
todogg15::lin was going to be traded to the raptors day before nets game then knicks decided to give him one last chance. more details here: http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
bodegas15::Rondo &gt; You.
tbest23::That last assist they gave Rondo was a stretch...
keepin it dirty since 1992::wow boston needs to break up their team and rebuild. they suck
bodegas15::This is the last year. I hope we see a playoff seed.
bodegas15::Daddy wins. Who is Jeremy Lin?
redsoxfan4ever2009::Two in a row, Congrats boys. The B's can't even say that this past month or so.
oreed born again sox4life::what is j-ONeal body made off. i would be afraid to shake his hand with all his injuries
thethithua::the most rigged game ever
keepin it dirty since 1992::i rigged it dude.
KingGeorge53::I bet thethithua has said that in  at least 21 games so far this season.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Hmm...
oreed born again sox4life::did i hear right from this game, dallas buying out lamar contract out, ? and boston interest getting him?
oreed born again sox4life::odom and khloe kardashian in boston?  hells nooooo
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Better than Moss or Ocho
_mongo__slade_::Why would anybody get excited about Odom at this point?
oreed born again sox4life::his game show it..too
Jdzspace::at this point, anyone who can rebound and or score to help us out is cause for some level of excitement
_mongo__slade_::Naw. The CP3 thing destroyed him.  He's no good when his head is messed up. As the Mavs are finding out.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::You wish you still had him.
Jdzspace::it's a rumor that Dallas brass denies. and Odom said he would want to play for Boston or Jersey (obviously based on whether or not they get Howard. . . which they will so it's irrelevant getting excited about)
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Odom would be a great fit. Cuban already said the contract will not be bought out.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::My Boston lineup:  KG PP Rondo Allen Pietrus  Until they get a Center. Forget Oneal. He stinks
mcase2012::he's alright hes a good former player which has size and can fill minutes at this point
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::When he decides he can play. Not impressed. never was.
mcase2012::no size will kill us against bigger teams which is alot, but sounds good in theory 3 good 3 point shooters
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Is it any worse than having ONeal at C?
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Small but fast
dpackrules::When the bucks trade kareem,,, With the picks they drafted Mar johnson, Moncrief, David Myers.. That was a great deal because they took us to the eastern finals twice.
12 Pats win 4::Didn't Mchale choke a guy in crowd at Milwaukee in playoffs once?
Captphilpart4::Randy Breuer ain't gonna do it for you
mcase2012::alright idealy, if we were gonna "blow it up" we would trade garnett for whatever we could get but pierce and allen i think we should hold onto they still have game int them ray will sign for less in the offseason and regardless garnett's salary wont be hindering our cap
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Duncan just owned Boozer. Makes my bball day.
dpackrules::How many rings would we of won if dirk, cassell, allen, big dog played together??? The bucks have proven they are the worst drafting team in the NBA over the last twenty years!!  IMO we win two..
dpackrules::But with the jabbar trade they drafted Mar johnson and moncrief!!
korn7860::To anyone who thinks Jabbar was going to stay in Milwaukee if we didnt deal him, be real.  Secondly, I wager most of you do not even know his real name, so stop talking about him.
12 Pats win 4::They were good. Jabbar is 1 of best ever though. They never won another ring without him. Crazy list of players that moved on from Bucks over the years. 80's battles with C's were awesome.
dpackrules::Yah,, So,,,
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Jennings and Bogut are a decent foundation. Should not have traded for Jackson.
12 Pats win 4::It's been more than 20 years. They let Jabbar go in his prime before those guys.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Didn't you draft Jennings and Bogut?
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Please don't get Beasley. PLEASE
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::or Blatche
go_go_goonstrike::any1 know all time scoring bucks player? assist leader?
dpackrules::Moncrief??
12 Pats win 4::Kareem.
oreed born again sox4life::oscar
oreed born again sox4life::danny going after d-willam....i think danny just don't like rondo for some reason, has nothing to do with his game,
oreed born again sox4life::if nets don't get howard, d-will wants out,  thats when danny dumba'ss comes in
Jdzspace::but odds are they will get Howard, and even if they don't. D.Will will sign in Dallas, he wants to go home. can't fault him for that
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::If DWill does not resign, he is going to DAllas
_mongo__slade_::Williams ain't going to Boston.
Jdzspace::no, the post was about Danny going after him. not about the likelihood of him coming to Boston.   HUGE difference
_mongo__slade_::the entire post is about DWill going to boston. he ain't. end of discussion.
Jdzspace::nobody said he was. we have as good of a chance of getting D.Will as LA Minor does in getting Dwight  zero
Jdzspace::how on earth can he even hope to get D.Will? that doesn't even make sense
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Agreed
oreed born again sox4life::danny doesn't know that
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::And that's why he should go.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Danny is not getting DWill. He needs to work around Rondo.
falseprophet2012::I dont think D-Will is much of an upgrade on Rondo. Just a better shooter and thats it. It will not change the team significantly.
TomBradys1::Celtics all day
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Stupid Kobe wearing the mask...
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::Danny Ainge: What? You're trying to punk me with a triple-double Rondo? Let's see who gets the last laugh...I TRADE YOU!!!
williamfernando_rn::Rondo for Ellis and robinson...
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::OMG
_mongo__slade_::You can't surround Rondo with a bunch of 2nd tier players and expect to win. That's what Boston has right now. Might as well trade him while he still has value &amp; start the rebuild. Maybe it won't take a quarter century this time around.
Jdzspace::well provided we don't have our two best young players tragically pass away, i think we'll be fine.   but don't get me wrong, i LOVE it when trash like you trivialize having two young players die. Like it means nothing.   pathetic
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::AGree with the Laker fan.
oreed born again sox4life::okc gm laugh @ that trade
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::I almost hope they do trade him to make Ainge look like a bigger idiot. Sick of his crap.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Did you read the Simmons article (I hate him now) but the Perk trade part was a good point.
Jdzspace::in his 20 games in a new system with new teammates? he didn't do great. but we both know that he is a much better player than he showed last year.   if we end up not getting him, then we'll call it a complete waste. until then it's up in the air.   but it still needed to be done when it was done, Danny did the right thing
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Not trying to be rude. Our issues are the big men and we traded away a good big man.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::What did Green do last year? Remind me. Sorry.
Jdzspace::we have a good chance to reclaim Green next year. which is a very good thing moving forward
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Seems like Presti had some inside knowledge on what was going down.
12 Pats win 4::C's are barely 500 since that trade. 5-4 in playoffs.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::What do we have now for Perk? At this point, I say the trade was a bust.
Jdzspace::do you know that? you willing to risk the rest of the season on it?   that is a dumb thing to ask the GM of a team to do. especially when we had 5 players injured at the time.   be realistic, Danny did the right thing
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Perk was the all time worst? Hmm....
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::They should have given Perk more time. He would have signed.
12 Pats win 4::Perk was the all-time worst trade. Trading Rondo would be dumber than Perk trade even. I think Cousy wants him traded to protect his assist records.
Jdzspace::yes he did, when the Celtics offered him the most they could. and Perk said "no" he sealed his own fate.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Did Perk? No. Ainge is a moron.
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::Ainge is a moron. But ultimately, Rondo must have done something to $@%! off one of the 'important people' in the organization. So that's why he's always on the trading block.
buckspackers23::Wow. On NBA.com, for the highlights of the Knicks game, they put a routine tear drop for lin as one and "Lin Bloodied" as another.   I wish Jeremy Lin just disappeared, I'm sick of this over hype.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::He fared well tonight. Why so mad?
buckspackers23::Look at the opponents though. New Jersey, New Orleans, Toronto, etc. The only good team they beat was the Lakers; however, that was at home, with the Lakers on the road. The Lakers are one of the worst road teams in the playoff picture right now.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Forget the TO's. Look at the wins. He has improved a team that was really bad.
buckspackers23::Yes, considering he only had 1 turnover. He's averaged 6.7 TOPG as a starter.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::I am not listening to analysts. He performed well tonight. Can you agree?
buckspackers23::NBA TV and ESPN talk about him all the time "He's better than Nash" blah blah blah. He shed a little blood tonight so that's the top highlight?
go_go_goonstrike::any1 know last bucks player to have triple double?
buckspackers23::Drew Gooden last april.
12 Pats win 4::Sikma.
oreed born again sox4life::oscar Robinson
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Bill Simmons needs to kiss the butts of everyone in Boston for his previous column.
th cobra360::why does everyone underestimate Rondo.
th cobra360::i guess all my Lakers friends just jealous that there only okay PG in late 30s and that celts got a star thats young
oreed born again sox4life::because everyone believe deep down he can't shoot
th cobra360::i mean someone whos not a celts fan
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::They hate.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::I never underestimate Rondo. Rondo owns the PG league.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::If you trade Rondo, you are basically saying I hope to draft a great PG.
mcase2012::this board is so much more pleasant when the celts win haha
oreed born again sox4life::they  only been 9 triple double all season rondo owns 3 of them amazing
champion_134::dunleavy with 28 pts. against wizards, 10 pts tonight.. what happened?
buckspackers23::I don't remember any open 3's.
oreed born again sox4life::this why i'll take rondo then must guards he always  fills up the stat sheets
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Rondo owns.
th cobra360::trade KG and someone else for DH12
th cobra360::pissoff
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Learn BBall
th cobra360::KG and a first round pick?
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::For D12? for the remainder of the season?
falseprophet2012::magic will not accept that deal, they want someone younger.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::KG has an expiring contract. The only two pieces that are good are Rondo and PP
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::TRADE PP FOR A CENTER.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Trade Rondo, my butt. Ainge would be a Rainman wannabe if he trades him.
falseprophet2012::Whats wrong with Paul This year, he starts off the year awful then returns to form for two weeks, and then goes right back to struggling again. I'll take 500 but starting next week this team is on the road the majority of March and April. Not looking good at all.
toxic_sports::is it normal to shi.t 4 times daily????????????????????????
buckspackers23::Why are shit jokes so funny to people on here?
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Are you on the Biggest Loser?
buckspackers23::Bucks either need to play hard for 48 minutes (not 42) or tank, now! 8-10 seed in the east is not where we want to be.
patriotcelticboston::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BucksPacker23... you are a funny kid. You think I'm in high school but don't know massachusettes is a state so I failed my geography test for the past 9 years?
buckspackers23::High school? Not many 10 year old kids attend high school.
Paycheck Nation::Problem is Celtics starters can't play like this every night, we need to develop the bench. We can't develop the bench when they are sitting on the bench. I mean are we going to win a title this year?..................
12 Pats win 4::True. Bench will be huge to any real playoff run. C's could win title. Once playoffs start, if they have energy left and play like tonight with more experienced bench. Why not?
mcase2012::moore and johnson need to play every game, for one thing theyre both pretty good
WeAreMarquette123::looks like we should lose the next 5 or so as well awesome.
toxic_sports::celtics are a good .500 team
geese915::wooohoo celtics
