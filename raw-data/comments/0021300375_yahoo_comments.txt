Giovanni::This is one of those games that is kind of painful to watch. Starting at the middle of the second overtime, both teams had less than 100 points.
Anton::Sad game to watch, no defense whatsoever...Knight dumps 36 and Knicks barely win against an 8-man Bucks team...Melo has to play 55 and JR 48, and Chandler 36 after injury...Iman just wants out now...
The Most Interesting Man in the World::I can see Mayo and Henson having big nights tonight.  And of course any opposing PG has a big night against the Knicks so count on Knight to go for 20 and 8 or so.  Good thing Sanders, Butler and Delfino aren't playing or the Knicks would get thrashed.  This one can go either way.
Haven::WE ALL KNOW WHATS COMING HERE. Hahaha "Were gonna give the ball to melo and stand back. Melo faisl everytime in this position but it doesnt matter because im the fat slob coach"
Amir::Woodson is good coach i don't blame him for anything but this handball change to send tilted Bargnani in offense in 2ND OT is bad.
Brian T::Stoudamire is an honest, hard working, selfless guy?  I would never charcterize him in any of those ways!  Woodson hasn't done well in NY, but no coach has since Prince Melo arrived.  He's untouchable, and no coach (and thus the Knicks) will ever be successful there as long as Melo is there.  Unless maybe Boeheim went to the NBA.  He seems to be the only coach Melo listened to
Vartino C::From 18-6 last year to 7-17 this year and without a first round draft choice.  Very sad state of affairs for the NY Knicks
Truth Be Told::"If you want the ball, go tip in my bricks"    -Carmelo Anthony
topher::Melo, Bargs and JR are having a brickfest!
Tay::Melo shoots 17 more shots than Beno ... makes 1 of them. Luckily, he's a star. So it's okay.
