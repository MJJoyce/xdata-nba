663Dan::no way
2858bmfekmvk::If you're not a Laker or TImberwolves fan and your on here then your just pathetic.
DWoe23::there is only 24 games left in the regular season, wow time is going fast. its almost playoff time
Jordanbetonbasketball1990-1998::http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2013/03/01/michael-jordan-hit-with-paternity-lawsuit-as-and-fiancee-choose-wedding-date/  The greatest.
scape228::So much for Indiana being a contender. In Indiana's two wins against the Heat the Heat were playing they're regular track meet type of game.  Come playoff time Haslem and Anderson (and Anthony if necessary) will punch back, and when you punch bullies like David West and and the rest they back off like they did last year. Then it's your George's against our James and Wade. Good luck with that.
DWoe23::@ scape - so by your logic, the next time the Heat, Knicks or Bulls lose a game, they will no longer be a contender?
LLindy86::Lose one game to a good team and you are no longer a "contender?" What a stupid comment. Pacers were without a starter to defend the rim effectively which I would say is a must against a team that has Blake Griffin on it and Paul driving to the basket. The Pacers should have played a more up tempo game in my opinion. That's why I like Lance Stephenson pushing the basketball. I must admit that George Hill gets burned often by good point guards.
Jordanbetonbasketball1990-1998::Heat fan, but Indiana is tough.
DWoe23::Pacers lost to a team that had 5 more victories than them. Thats not a bad loss. its not like it was the wizards. Pacers gave up 50 points in the paint without there 7'2 center in the lineup.
Pacersfan4ever::Lol West a bully?why becuz he protected our center from 3 GS players coming at him? Here comes Heat fans and the last year talk.....smh
Pacers Go Deep::contender? we are. you're a idiot.  hibbert was out.  would have won if he was there
ExtinctionofwhiteCornerbacks::- Cleeepers - #3 in the West plays #2 in the East in a close, hard-fought game.    ESPN headline story?    "Lottery team beats other lottery team".    How far do the lakers have to sink before ESPN takes their nuts out of their mouths?    10 fans like this. _______________________________________________ Lol, best comment thus far -- worth a 1,000 re-posts, in hopes that SOMEONE at ESPN could reach deep down to find their inner-integrity (if it exists) and give a 'headline' just a LITTLE closer to something of SUBSTANCE; rather than undeserving, pointless mainstream regurgitation...over and over again. Jesus Christ, SHOW SOME BALLS!
ExtinctionofwhiteCornerbacks::- Resident_Guido - The Pacers would be a 6th seed in the west. They're numbers are skewed from getting to play Charlotte, Washington, Detroit, Cleveland, Orlando 4 times each this season.     Yes they play hard, but you can't tell me that Pacers team is better than Memphis.  ___________________________________________  Umm, well they did BEAT Memphis... TWICE... without Granger! Soo... facts say otherwise.  Oh, and I notice how you conveniently left out that the Pacers are 2-0 vs the Heat (holding them to their TWO LOWEST scoring totals of the year!) 2-1 vs NYK, 2-0 vs da Bulls -- top East teams. And all without our leading scorer from last year. Hmmm
IndySports24x7::Just a bad night for the Pacers.  Too many turnovers against a great team like the Clippers.  But we'll bounce back and go on another run destroying teams by double digits!  Go Pacers!
LeBronOrKobeMVP::I really like this Pacers team.. They have a little bad boy Pistons in them.
WestsideAmbitionz::Great to see the clipshow together again, plus congrats to another winning season, that makes it back to back... lets keep rising and prove to the rest of the league we are a threat.
BoWendy McHardie Bugers::CP3 is nasty the guy has tremendous talent great floor general.
BorisEtxe::Chris Paul is for PG`s, what LBJ is for SF`s.
DWoe23::um i dont get it either. are you saying that Chris Paul is the best point guard and LBJ is the best small forward...
BorisEtxe::if you couldn`t figure it out...answer is textbook!
WestsideAmbitionz::uh okay...
kb24underseas::If Clippers don't make it to the Finals will CP3 sail ship in the off season?
A Drunk Monk::The only reason why he would leave (still not likely) is if the Clippers got swept or beatdown in the 1st round.   As long as they compete in the playoffs he's happy- ideally they would improve upon last year's performance (2nd round sweep)
Clipper Ian::No, but D12 will.
SouthLincolnHusker::No thug, no win!
ExtinctionofwhiteCornerbacks::Hibbert is far from a thug. Don't be an ignorant tool. Nobody likes those guys
Clipper Ian::Pacers simply had an off night. It happens. San Antonio lost to Phoenix AT HOME on Wednesday and yes, as a Clippers fan, I'm still not so blind as to see that Hibbert would've helped. I still think we win, but Pacers aren't any less of a contender after losing to the team with the league's fourth best record.
Abstraktmind::yes i can.
Resident_Guido::The Pacers would be a 6th seed in the west. They're numbers are skewed from getting to play Charlotte, Washington, Detroit, Cleveland, Orlando 4 times each this season.   Yes they play hard, but you can't tell me that Pacers team is better than Memphis.
Pacersfan4ever::Lol we have beat memphis twice and we have only played Orlando once. Watch some NBA before u criticize my friend.
A Drunk Monk::Loving the Clippers road record this season- great leadership by CP3, Billups, and the vets.
yellowdart24::The Pacers had won five games in a row (10 of 12) by an average of 19 points per game then they lose one game to one of the best teams in the NBA without their center in the middle to prevent Paul from driving to the lane and everyone starts saying the Pacers are terrible again... SMH. I don't want to take anything away from the clippers But Hibbert playing last night would've made the difference
gt1master_ike::Hibbert wasn't the difference. I look at it as the Clippers scoring 99 point despite missing so many open shots. On a regular night, that is a 110 point effort. This just so happened to occur against the best defensive team in the league bu Hibbert is an interior player. He is not stopping all those shots on the perimeter. And most of Paul's drives were floaters in the lane. He has one of the best floaters along with TOny Parker.
DWoe23::the 1st 14 TO's of the pacers werent forced. Mental mistakes on the offensive side of the ball caused the off night, but it shows how good our defense is. They were able to hang with the Clips till the end do to keeping the score close.
DWoe23::what helps me sleep at night is that i have faith that my team is a great team and even better cometitor. They lost to the clippers, good job Clips, i say. but i still can decifer how certain mistakes vs a good team can calculate in a loss.
A Drunk Monk::Whatever helps you sleep at night. Clippers lead the league in opponents turnovers per game. Clippers will enjoy the win and move on to Cleveland.
A Drunk Monk::The Clippers starting C only played 10 minutes and then got hurt. Pacers got 20+ minutes of Ronny Turiaf and the Clips still won.   Not to mention they shot an abysmal 19% or so from 3 (many of them wide open shots). That won't happen again.
OlBoyP::we really could have used roy is this one
Lebroncouldcareless::so  lebron  says!
Danadude69::We are playing good now, the test will be against OKC on Sunday.
Clipper Ian::I'm more worried about Cleveland tonight!
heitz13::thought games with that many turnovers were gone.  Pacers couldn't catch the damn ball.
LigiRuiz::Jamal Crawford is a beast
knicks_112ndcoming::guess whosse back on 2nd .?  these guys
midgarsshadow::enjoy your short stay
Rumrunner66::remember what the pacers did to the knicks? Too soon?
knicks_112ndcoming::we have been 2nd or 1st for a long time. longer  than u guys
dorucevic::I just wanna say one thing. If these Pacers had only one superstar  I think the rest of the nba teams would be $@%!$@
nigel.inagan::Its been ock vs SA in WCF..
Mingism::OKC has been there, Clippas have yet to get there
SMANGANG::the clips franchise is still a joke!! They just got their 1st back to back winning seasons and their fans talk like they've been winning championships.. make it to a WCFs one time.. haha
A Drunk Monk::You sound like a Laker fan. I thought Pacer fans were classy.
OlBoyP::Pacers ABA Championships = 3
Mrklit::Pacers NBA Championships = 0
Theironrod2012::chris paul = overrated and arrogant
Cleeepers::*but only since the veto  Bitter laker fan.  http://www.nba.com/standings/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Cnf.html  Does it still sting?
Clipper Ian::Comment of the day!
Cleeepers::#3 in the West plays #2 in the East in a close, hard-fought game.  ESPN headline story?  "Lottery team beats other lottery team".  How far do the lakers have to sink before ESPN takes their nuts out of their mouths?
yutc8k::I think the Pacers will be fine, it was a off night. Hibbert hurts but Mahini is a more than serviceable backup C. You guys act like Hibbert has never sat on the bench this year. My Pacers just turned the ball over on offense, and played sloppy D. If you watched the game, the Clipper's poor 3pt % is kind of embarrassing seeing as how the Pacers were leaving them open all night. This should have been a blow out, but we'll bounce back. (Especially after Vogel slays these fools tomorrow in practice)
Steveforprez04::Rockets, Blazers, Jazz, Lakers, Warriors all battling to see who gets steamrolled in the 1st round
Pacersfan4ever::Good game Clips. Yes the game woukd have been different with Hibbert. Anybody who has played ball in their life knows that having a premier shot blocker behind u on defense will always help. Anyways good luck Clips. Spurs-Clips WCF. F.uck Westbrook and Thunder
nigel.inagan::I dont think they can beat the okc..
ThunderHornz::Just because we beat you? Calm down sugar!
Pacersfan4ever::Nah just dont like Westbrook, hes an a-hole
LALakersboy24.7::lol
266noel::pacers go home in the first round   ....bunch of misarable
DWoe23::your right there 1st two games will be at home...
266noel::pacers coc....suckers garbage
DWoe23::pacers tough nosed defensive team blue collar grit players.
rhuff1118::Clips are going to the Western Conf Finals this season. And I'm a Grizz fan.
junoXJ::haha fk the pacers, that's what you get for knocking my boy Lee out b!tches
Daveeeeeed::17.4% from 3s and we still won, hah
hanley0517::Pacers have a really nice squad. Can't wait to see them in the playoffs.
stingfan1985::Truly one of the BEST wins of the year!!! We're once again playing .700 ball and kicking tail. Now it's on the Cleveland and avenge an earlier home loss (of which I unfortunately witnessed in person).  We owe them one!  Let's go Clips!!!
Clipper Ian::Yeah, wife and I were there for that embarassment also. Hornets, too (we are season ticket holders). But hey, San Antonio lost to Phoenix at home the other night!
ThunderHornz::Unfortunately we all have some of those losses in our closet. I am confident you WILL get your revenge.
A Drunk Monk::The best kept secret in the NBA right now is Memphis winning 8 straight, they have figured out how to play without Rudy Gay. I'd be scared if I were the Spurs
rhuff1118::I hope you're right. The Rudy G trade was a win-win. I'm glad he's doing so well in Toronto.
46hfkjehfe::Kate Upton is a fox  http://www.allfreechips.com/?ref=sapcunc
A Drunk Monk::Damn, that's a smokin' picture
46hfkjehfe::Lakers got the women like Heidi Klum  http://www.allfreechips.com/?ref=sapcunc
9087ekfjekj::Lakers still best with women  http://www.allfreechips.com/?ref=sapcunc
Vinsomniac::The NBA sucks compared to these college games
Robdee999::Lance was balling tonight. But those 22 TOs really helped us earn this L. Good Game to the Clippers though.
GBE bang::[_______________________________] [_______________________________] [_______________________________] [_______________________________] [_______________________________] Clippers Trophy Case
A Drunk Monk::How cute- a Laker fan.
ThunderHornz::Get the RAID!
Illinicub53333::These two teams have wayyyyy better records than the Lakers and Wolves, yet their game is the one featured on ESPN's front page. -.-
A Drunk Monk::Kobe has been unreal this year.
pipclooney6_realNBA_analyst::We should just send the Miami Heat to the Olympics.
Samac112::Anyone see David Thorpes' new rookie top 10?? this guy... ive been seeing his headlines lately, class A idiot. Not only does he not have Lillard #1, if there was anyone to be ranked ahead of him, it's BRADLEY BEAL. Anthony Davis?? Are you kidding me? that's so cliche.
BBUSA1::Hey Pacer fans. Stop crying about Hibbert. DJ had a nose bleed and only played 10 minutes. Also, Hibbert has been mostly below average this year. The Clippers are simply better than the Pacers.
masterjoe712::How would you know? This is probably the first Pacer game you watched all year. Hibbert would definitely have helped control the amount of points in the paint, but really whatever good game.
