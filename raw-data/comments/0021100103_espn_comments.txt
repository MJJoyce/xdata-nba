jrachi856::Bulls fans stop hating on Dwight. You don't need Dwight to win, you rather have Noah and Asik, please stop it. Take away Noah and Asik and give the Bulls Dwight and they crush the Heat in the playoffs very easily. Dwight is TOO BIG, TOO STRONG, and TOO DOMINATE. Another thing, stop comparing D. Rose's will to win and competitiveness to Michael Jordan, if he had the same will to win and competitive fire he'd be much better defensively. M. Jordan was very dominate on both ends of the court. D. Rose is by far the best PG in the NBA but he is no where near M. Jordan.
jrachi856::Bede Bears, it's eay to insult someone behind a computer or cell phone. If you can't say it to their face then don't say it like real men do. You Bulls fans need to go back on any Bulls conversation and you will read fans comparing D. Rose's competitiveness to MJ. Why would I be mad because Rose outplayed Nelson? Rose is better than Nelson, I wouldn't expect anything else. Bulls fans want to call me a idiot but saying the Bulls aren't a lock to beat the Heat with Dwight is crazy. For one, Dwight would make the defense much better and he'd turn Wade and LeBron into jump shooters. Second, with Dwight down-low, the Heat cannot send the help defense on Rose when he penetrates. Three, if you think Paul and Griffin is lob city, Dwight and Rose would put them to shame.
Bede Bears::JRachi is an idiot and is spewing $@%! that Bulls fans have never said.
RunTheBall22::You cant just get ride of Noah and Asik  for dwight and say we crush the heat. the whole team would look differnt who knows who we would have left and if we would need a couple of years to get some role players
SJZ.SupermanMVP::Sounds like your mad D rose stuffed Nelson.
jrachi856::Making too much out of one game, did having the best record win the Bulls a title last season? The Bulls didn't dominate the game like Bulls fans think, the Magic missed a lot of open shots.. The one good thing the Bulls did do good was the offensive rebounding, that's what really hurt the Magic. There are two more games left between these the Bulls and Magic, it ain't over yet. Good game Bulls, you took the 1st game. The Magic will be back.
Kage963::I agree the Magic missed some open shots, but that happens to every team every game.  The Bulls played very well defensively after the first quarter.  I also think that the Magic are going to struggle against teams that are quick and aggressive defending the perimeter, such as the Bulls and the Heat.  The Magic have Howard, and then a bunch of stand still shooters, guys who can't create their own shot off the dribble.  Get out and challenge those shots, and more times than not you'll get a stop.
Bede Bears::I thought Glen Davis was seriously hurt laying on the ground, then he does some skit where he gets shocked back to life by Dwight Howard and being a Bulls fan I just shook my head and thought to myself "With this kind of attitude and ridiculousness this Magic team is a joke and has no shot at winning anything this year".
shaunmajeed::Go bulls D Rose Back2Back MVP!!!
Magicmike321::Calm down bulls fans.  This was like the 7th game of the season, doesn't mean anything
chritter66::Yeah, winning games doesn't mean anything.
minny snowta::uh magikmike, you calm down because your disney magic team is worse off than last year because a) you are still in a division with miami.  b) your best player doesn't really want to be there and/or c) the fans are idiots.  bulls fans, get excited for another successful year with the league's reigning mvp and i'll bet the bulls are hungrier after last years disappointing eastern conf. loss.  the heat are good but i think the bulls are better this year and they are putting together a great team the right way, not like lebron and his collusive buddies.  i like what MJ said about them and how in his day he would never get into bed with the enemy.  the fact that 'bron has wade and bosh means he cant get mvp because he has the most help between him and rose.  rose really put a whole team on his shoulders, sort of like james back in his cleveland days but those days are long gone.
johnrowley12::Butler, fingers crossed, will be sick-nasty.....I think by the end of the year he'll end of being our Kieth Bogans of last year....4th guard on the team who just plays lock down defense and who has ridiculous athletic talents.
Mcatee1117::I definitely like the way the reigning MVP is playing this year...almost pulled off two triple doubles already. Assists are up over last year and his scoring is down as other players are stepping up and helping him out. Not to mention we are using a third string PG who is actually looking pretty good filling in for CJ Watson. As soon as Jimmy Butler starts playing more he can be a huge defensive piece as he has shown in his little playing time.
Mcatee1117::yep only the 8th game in which the Bull have won 7 of them and have played 6 of the 8 games on the road with another one tonight and not to mention the Bulls are tied for the best record with Miami...so yeah I think I like our chances. One thing I would worry about Orlando fans is with all the damned spot up shooters ya'll have who is gonna drive the ball in the lane when you aren't making your outside shots?
IlliniDave68::If it didn't mean anything, why are you here telling us to calm down?
ZzTrueAznBallerZz::BULLS FAN NEED TO CALM DOWN -_-
minny snowta::the suns stink!
ZzTrueAznBallerZz::exactly
PleaseDontBanMeBro::wah.....cry me a river df....if it didn't mean anything then why play it?
Welcome2daGoodBurger::8th
GetOffMeDude::I wonder if Dwight Howard now wants to play in Chicago, saw him laughing and chatting w/ D.Rose.
gorditadogg::I really think the Bulls are fine with the team they have.  If Howard really wants to win (and I have serious doubts that he does) he needs to go play with a veteran like Kobe who will keep his butt in line.
gorditadogg::Magic fans, what did you think about the comedy sketch Howard and Davis performed with about 4 minutes left?
2 big 2 fast 2 strong 2 good::Like if you think Chris Broussard is the most annoying, idiotic analyst in sports
t casey::Sorry, but I gotta go with the ebony and ivory of obnoxiousness, Stephen A. Smith and Skip Bayless.
saadenger11::stephen a smith is annoying, but at least he is more accurate, Skip Bayless spews of ignorance and unintelligence.
the702shogun::money may the root the of all evil, but it still buys lots of nice stuff
the702shogun::dwight's making 18 mil a year, i'd play on prairie view for 18 mil a year
manewto1::Da Bulls! Magic suck.... again.
the702shogun::ok, here's the definition of pain. they're paying turkeyglue 11, that's eleven, millions dollars a year...for that! that's like a mil per missed shot, 500k per bad defense. and why did you resign reddick otis? they're paying him 6.75 mil a year, for that? pain, it's what's for breakfast
fizzo43::god damn, the magic suck!
roesthlisbergercoverup25::Magic are so average right now. Losing one then winning one. Losing one then winning one. I try not to watch too much of it. I may start to cry.
cowsley::This is by far the funniest thing from the entire article. "Magic swingman Quentin Richardson was inactive, recovering from a chemical burn on his ankle after a self-treatment mishap in which he iced his sore ankle with Icy Hot and then applied ice to it."
n8dom::Even better was the player who sat out because of an allergic reaction to shellfish.
manewto1::Too much coolaid
the702shogun::the rest of the team besides dwight are trying hard, it's just they plain old, no bones about it, AND with undeniable certainty, suck at the high end nba level.  i'd cut someone right now, then clear the bench to see who can play and who can't, then ship the sorriest ones out one then two at a time plus scour the d-league
the702shogun::not sure if otis can pull it out, but he needs to unload the whole team (other than dwight of course), and make jameer nelson a back-up to a real pg. the team has no scorers. it's officially time to send turkeyglue to the bench, then back to wherever he came from
bigt7698::I can honestly say that listening to booze yell is histerical. I want to make a soundtrack of him. This season I have heard BOARD!, BLOCK THAT SHI* JO, AND 1!, AHHHHH!, and Im sure im missin a couple
bigt7698::lol...I definently heard that one abyss
AbyssinianLion::Grab it Jo!!!
bigt7698::lol...me and my buddies will just sit there and wait for it and laugh
Kage963::Yeah, the on floor mics are great for the purpose.  I always hear him yelling "GIMME THAT SHI*" when he goes up for a rebound.
fishheatfins::Do Bulls fans honestly think they can hang with the Heat in a 7 game series? I think the Bulls are a good team but I just don't see them or any other team beating the Heat this year since the Heat are clearly better than what they were last year.
rynodesign::LeBron guarding Rose will have to change this year. The addition of Hamilton and Brewer playing good ball will change how D have to guard the bulls. Last year they could leave Bogans and it didn't matter because he wouldn't drop 15 or 20 and Hamilton is capable of that. This a different look for the Bulls this year. Same team only better. They are really starting to gel.
buller23::thats bcause u dont no s.h.i.t about bball
minny snowta::both teams are good but the heat are filled with chumps! lebron, wade and bosh did some collusive stuff to proclaim themselves the champs and they didn't even win.  Rose and the bulls are building a championship team the right way, by working hard, no shortcuts! just like MJs team.
GaZaRa_9::bulls in 6
surfzone365::That's why they play the games.  Heat were crowned NBA champs before last season started.  Didn't happen.  Meanwhile, noone expected the Bulls to finish with the best record.
minny snowta::james would have his hands full with Deng, Rose would be schooling chalmers and shooting 'lights out!'
surfzone365::And the Bulls defense can REALLY bother the Heat
chicagofan68::except that as mentioned above, both teams are different. biggest problem for the bulls last season was the focus on rose. last night was a perfect example of what changed, as four players had over 18 points. wade won't be able to ignore bogans to double rose like last season, etc. plus, with that bench the bulls may be the best rested team this season, which could be the difference between seeds 1 and 2.
ZzTrueAznBallerZz::James can really bother D-ROSE shot...so i dunno about how the Bulls can take on the heat in 7 games series either... yeah the Bulls might win 1 or 2 games against the heat in the regular season but that doesnt mean u can beat them in 7 games  last year in ECF??? playoff is totally diff from regular season match up
chicagofan68::and the bulls are better than they were last season, and by a greater margin than the heat. their offense is very much improved because of rip, and they will likely still be one of the best defensive teams. should be a great series.
tgrim22::DAAAA BULLS
2 big 2 fast 2 strong 2 good::Pass me the HOT SAUCE!
BShaw99::Sooooo Where them magic fans at that thought ryan anderson and the magic was gone beat the bulls lastnight lmao
minny snowta::yea, they stomped 'em good and derrick rose is still mvp in my eyes.  maybe Klove or Durant but the bulls are a better team than the other 2.
BShaw99::the leading scorer for the magic who had 5 points lmao its so funny cause they really thought they can hang with the bulls and the bulls continue to shut hem up
Chicagocold312::Ryan Anderson, who's that?
Chicagocold312::The Bulls can beat the Heat as long as the game is officiated fairly by the refs.
tgrim22::yeah ill agree you can never blame the refs.. if they are calling it adjust your game so they can't call it... but also anyone is beatable
manewto1::Tim donhegy didnt fix any games did he. What makes you think other refs aren't working for the mob?
GaZaRa_9::which will be the Bulls this year
fishheatfins::Yes anyone is beatable on any given night but in a 7 game series its the best team that comes out on top
tgrim22::ahh the heat trolls arrive...
fishheatfins::Lol just the truth. And blaming the refs come on give me a breaaaaak brotha
fishheatfins::You're a joke and so is your comment. 4-1 ECF last year
Daniela Chi Town::last year idiot
Chicagocold312::Tough game tonight in ATL, but i know the Bulls will be up for the challenge as usual.
VanGundyGoneHipster::Atlanta is on the end of a back-back-back+4ots. And NTTH!
Chicagocold312::If Dwight wouldn't want to play for the Bulls that just shows he don't wanna win, he's happy just to be in MW3 commercials!!!
gorditadogg::LOL
BShaw99::he doesnt want to win and he thinks he can be the number 1 guy on the team which is dumb even lebron nos he's not the #1 guy its Dwade
Chicagocold312::Ok where's the Heat trolls i know they're coming, Bulls 7-1 out of 8 games, 2-0 at home and 5-1 on the road. Can anyone say ROAD WARRIORS?
smkindrizo::chyea buddy
smkindrizo::lol at quentin richardson
ImNotThaDaddy::Bulls aint neva goin. Dey bout dat ring this year. Real talk homies.
Daniela Chi Town::yezzir?
saadenger11::daniela you are hot.
JakeRank::D12 &gt; D Rose.    D12 is bigger, stronger, BETTER!
WhiteSoxFan12389::of course hes bigger his position calls for that, if anyting i say that him being bigger actually makes drose better- can do more smaller
smkindrizo::bulls won last night, did you catch the game? sorry for your loss
Jeff23583::CP3 &gt;  D Rose
Kage963::Plus, when Paul's team plays against Rose and the Bulls, he is 0-5 in his career.  Seems to me if you are a better player than somebody, you should be able to beat them at least once.
Chicagocold312::Wow that's the funniest joke i heard all year...
smkindrizo::bulls already beat the clippers, sorry
crocket1516::false
Unbiasedfan83::The Bulls wouldn't be doing this good if Del Negro was their coach still. Tom Thibs is the main reason. Not D. Rose
Donchico51274::Great D coach with Great team chemistry and playing calm is what i get from watching the Bulls they seem to have a lot of compassion for the game.
Kage963::Thibs has been an awesome coach.  His defensive knowledge and the intensity he requires of his players are not matched by any coaches in the NBA, and definitely not matched by Del Negro.  However, Rose was not this good under Del Negro either.  Plus, there are several new players (Boozer, Brewer, Korver, Watson, Asik, Hamilton, etc.) that Del Negro never had.  There are alot more factors than just the coaching switch to explain why the Bulls are one of the league's elite teams right now, although I agree that Thibs is a way better NBA coach than Del Negro.
smkindrizo::it takes a combination of the two
crocket1516::I didn't know Thibs was out there shooting baskets
Tebow in the Playoffs::this game should never have been this close before the 17-6 run. they need rip and his outside shooting to push through when rose is shut down at times.
smkindrizo::still won
chisports09::Haha, "hang on"?  Makes it sound like a one- or two-point game.
openminded43::Every long rebound was gobbled up by the Bulls, every 50/50 ball the same!!! That's shows NO HEART or HUSTLE on the Magic's part!!!
openminded43::Trade Nelson for a second round pick if you can even get that!!! He's the worst excuse for a SPG in the whole League!!! Actually besides Redick, you can get rid of the whole backcourt!!!
MMoney0021::I know its only 8 games in but I have been impressed so far with Deng.  I think its the best hes ever looked.
VanGundyGoneHipster::I agree but he will have nothing left come playoffs if Thibs keeps playing him 40 min a game.
Truth567::See last season
glmourpuss::VANGUNDY is an IDIOT! Use Wafer and Clack! They are good! Vangundy's mind set is worst than a 3 year old. He so stubborn and insists on playing the old legs the whole game! Get with the program and play these fresh legs on the bench! GO F MAGIC!!!!!!!!
ZzTrueAznBallerZz::and what happen to Clark???

ahwickman::I say let hm play the whole game and finally put to rest further speculation on ability.  And in my opinion East Rankings.  Bulls Heat  Hawks Magic Pacers Celtics (Only because they have a great coach) 76 er's Knicks (They would be better with a real coach)
johnrowley12::After the class by themselves....  Hawks, Magic, Pacers, Celtics, and then Bucks/76ers are a throw up.....
johnrowley12::Being a Bulls fan I saw the Pacers play a couple times last year (regular season and playoffs) and every game they got better, especially in the playoffs.  They're a young team with good players they're just missing one very good player.  I think this will be the Celtics last year of relevance.  They're going to get rid of Rondo and they no longer have Jeff Green.
fastrandstrongr1::this forum is shameful. guess that's what happens when the population of miami becomes briefly interested in sports.
