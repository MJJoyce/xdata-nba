Brian Jones::Mike Scott needs more touches
Reeves Cox::That would imply he gets more playing time. However, something you apparently have failed to realize is... One. His plus or minus sucks. Two. It sucks because he plays no defense. Just scoring doesn't win games. Take a look at our first three losses.
Justin Jenkins::Hawks win 97-88
Reeves Cox::LET'S GO HAWKS! Come on. Crappy defense is going to be the death of me. We just have to play defense and we'll win a lot of games! I can tell our offense this year will continue being explosive! The ball movement is great, but the defense is pretty ugly. Go HAWKS! Beat the Magic!
Matt Mcguckin::Paul Millsap was the greatest steal of the off-season.
Klaitu Richards::Not really how I feel about this team, we dont have a superstar to build around.  I just tired of all these years of topping out in t he second round.  Next year's draft is going to be great, so right now im like whatever.
Daniel Stewart::Orlando has a good team once again. Always enjoyed competitive games between ATL and ORL. This should be a good one. ATL 106 ORL 101
Mang Artemio::atl up by 14 pts earlier and now up by 4 pts. what are they doing?????
