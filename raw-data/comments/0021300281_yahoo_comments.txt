Tony Anthony::Didn't expect the Bucks to win this one, but they hit tough shots and played great D tonight. Great effort on their part.   The Wizards need to show up every game, whether they're playing the Heat or the Bucks. They were too complacent in the 1st half, and that came back to haunt them as they weren't able to recover. Wall played well in the 4th, but he was out of control in the 2nd quarter and OT. He needs to take better shots, and take better care of the ball.
Amir::Wizards 2nd unit when Maynor is on floor is something close to horrible, our starters are great.
Ghetto Genius::The Bucks are going for a lottery pick and the Wiz the playoffs.
Tony Anthony::JOHN WALL!!! Dude's a beast! Easily the best PG in the East!
fup duck::win or lose, Milwaukee is bringing it tonight
Bill::Very disappointing effort by the Bucks. They had that game blown and let it slip back into their hands. It's almost like they don't want to finish with the worst record.
Bobbyk::Knight is becoming Jennings Part 2.
bloc da shot::Hah  Khris Middleton the man.    Singleton who?
bloc da shot::Follow the Stats Jac H.  Singleton is having a career game, hello?  he stay's in while he's hot
Tony Anthony::I thought John Wall played well in the 4th, but he is stinking it up in OT. Looks like the Bucks got this unless they choke.
