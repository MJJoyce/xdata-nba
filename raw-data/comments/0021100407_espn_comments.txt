zachrlee::When Lin has done lately, Nash has been doing it his whole career. The most memorable playoff series Nash had was when he led the Suns past the Lakers, after being down 1-3 in the series. And that was without Amare!

The_Ref_You_Love_To_Blame::That's why I don't like sorry teams like the Kings, they'll show up and compete against the Thunder, but don't compete against other teams. This is the difference between a good and bad team. You compete against all teams equally not just against one team to get you out of hot water.
