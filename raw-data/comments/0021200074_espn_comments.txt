Mark34053::Seriously some people down playing Davis's success really don't understand basketball....especially that idot talking about Gilchrest. People need to pay attention to Davis's numbers mixed with the minutes  That is why he has a play Efficiency rating of 33.8 right now (which is higher then MJ) that's how good he has been in his first 3 games  Per 36 minutes- 23 PPG- 540% 3.6 blocks 2 steals and 11 rebounds
Anthony Davis is the Second Coming of Kevin Garnett::people mocked me for this name about 8 months ago  looks like i am laughing now...people used to say MKG was UK's best player and try to downplay davis.....they didn't know what they were talking about  but i do love some mkg though.....he will scary when he fixes his jumper....and as hard of a worker as he is i know that he will
Mark34053::Davis was UK's best player and he wasn't selfish at all in doing it. He has a better offensive game then he showed in college simply because he never looked to score in college. He avg 14 ppg on a ridiculous 63% shooting  However Gilchrest was Kentucky's leader
Mark34053::yea I love Gilchrest also he is built in the Jordan mold. A hard worker, relentless taking it to the rim. His defense is off the charts and although he isn't as good on-ball as jordan he is a better shot blocker. The one weakness like Jordan is the jumpshot but he has a jordan like work ethic also. And it just so happens Jordan owns the Cats  The only reason people are down playing Davis's success is the same reason people hate on Griffin and James. They get so much attention that people just have to hate on it.
WeAreMarquette 2.0::Ben Gordon should be starting
whodattrackgeauxtigers::I'm fine trading gordon for Granger, dumping Granger and having the huge cap space. Before you say Gordon for Granger is totally one-sided, would you rather have Gordon or 45 million dollars over the next 3 years in cap space?
CandySparker::Big Bert Lotta Love!
FatCat_00::Rivers has been atrocious so far   hope he starts playing better
gouhuskies3::Davis continuing his dominance over NCAA talent
Michel de Nostradame::**Chi Town Please Stand Up** is the biggest Bum on these boards. Read the below comment exchanges between us and see how he got OWNED. Dude chooses a slang Phrase for his Name and wants to be word Police lmfao
Reddog7786::AD is very impressive.....i underestimated his ability to shoot,he is not intimidated by older players.  I hate it when posts are degrading this or that player....IMO,anybody playing in the NBA are great,even the bench players.
Andrew4Bama4::MKG next star in the NBA!
SdotPaul504::Yea but this idiot above said Anthony Davis will be a bust lmao
Kev_010::Gordon clearly stated that he doesn't want to play for the Hornets and that he preferred the Suns yet the Hornets still give him a contract lol just trade him already
NolaJag::I dont think Gordon wants to be traded. He just used the suns to get the hornets to offer the extra 8 million dollars they werent giving him
ALeonard118::Hornets should trade EG to Utah for some of their nice young players
lsutigerguy1::I say put Rivers to SG like he did in college because Gordon's never playing for the Hornets.
hvs1717::Great job off the bench tonight BRob.
CandySparker::Cheers Super AD
LesGeaux225::What is the best package you think we can get for Eric Gordon? We need players that complement Anthony.
Sterling8673::The Hornets won tonight because Austin Rivers brought his 4 points and career high four assists to the game.  That is his highest assists total in high school, college or the NBA.  The next Isiah Thomas.
NolaJag::He had 6 assists last week against utah....for a shooting guard that's not bad at all. Give the rookie some time
KikyExcel::Damian Lillard? Who?...
LgFg13::Rivers has to find a rhythm with the jumper. His ball handling and quick step are superb, but needs that jumper to get going.
KSJezz1::Loving the unibrow down in NO ?  He is amazing. God how good can he get ?
LgFg13::Amazing. He is the most skilled player in the draft and it is showing.
LgFg13::Also Eric Gordon will never play another game in a Hornets jersey.
Sterling8673::Players from Indianapolis can't take pain.  Alan Henderson, Eric Gordon, Greg Oden, Eric Montross.  NBA Superstars.
LgFg13::Don't let it fool ya. Brian Roberts is a terrible point guard when it comes to vision, handles and passing ability. He only looks for his shot.
Reddog7786::cant shoot either....7/8 from floor...freakn bum !!
Reddog7786::Ya,he is horrible.....8 dimes and 1 turnover,plus lay up and three at end sealed the deal
LgFg13::Oh he is awful. Been following him since Summer League. Just watch... NBA season is a marathon. Same with Robin Lopez.
tani_budde::I also got to give a shout out to B Rob playing smart and hard out there after a tough game the other night. Our bench came through, but Roberts was a surprise.
Reddog7786::+1
gt1master_ike::Lillard is probably one of the most nba ready rookies in this  draft . He could put up monster rookie numbers like Kyrie Irving last year and win ROY and he might even be better than AD in their first 2 years. But usually, most players are the players they will be by their 3rd or 4th year and that is where AD will pass him if he hasn't already done so to that point.
KSJezz1::Davis will win ROY. Look at how complete his game tonight was. That is some crazy stat line for a rookie.
tani_budde::It was predicted in a lot of mocks that Lillard was in the low teen range in the draft. Hornets were close to getting him I think. How crazy would that have been?
gt1master_ike::Agree but  I still want to see Rivers. I know he has started slow but hopefully he can turn it around.
halapar64::Davis is special man..He'll give you guys 110% game in and game out.
mall77::I had the same thoughts on him also as alexander91579
alexander91579::i knew he would be good.  I just thought him being so young that his first season he would really struggle.  but nothing of the sort.  hes the real deal dangerfield.
Chi Town Stand Up::Something tells me that when a bench player scores 34 and no one else cracks 15 it's time for a change in the starting lineup...
Chi Town Stand Up::oh and reggie williams
alexander91579::Yeah, but they have to keep some scoring off the bench.  if you take him off, who is your bench?
tani_budde::Taylor looked good at the beginning. Don't know why Charlotte didn't try putting him in.
Chi Town Stand Up::jefferey taylor
halapar64::As a big UK fan it's good to see Davis contributing to a team thats needs help. No fear the Brow is here! lol
alexander91579::I was not expecting him to be this GOOD this soon. This is a fun team to watch.  Too bad gordon doesnt want to join in on the fun.  I truly believe they could be a 7 or 8 seed if he could suck it up and be a MAN.
tani_budde::Lillard who? RoY award will belong to the BROW by the end of the season, along with others.
gt1master_ike::AD going ham tonight.  Keep it up Rook.
gt1master_ike::David Who? JK. I love D west and CP but this is a new era for the Hornets and IM happy we got talent again. Hopefully Gordon can come back and turn into a stud.
alexander91579::makes losing d west, and cp3 a lot easier, am not gonna lie.....the hornets should be tough year in and year out now....
SdotPaul504::Hey Uk! I wanna thank you guys for giving us this beast of a player &amp; you too Stern. Sincerely A Hornets fan    A. Davis 23 Pts, 12 Reb, 2 Ast, 2 Stl, 5 Blk
I loathe God::gang. i could put up a double-double in today's nba. also, 1.5 bpg? ben wallace averaged 3.5 one season  davis guy isn't that impressive
gt1master_ike::MKG is a good athlete but to say he has more upside than Davis is foolish. His offensive game is based on outworking people. Come on now.
Chi Town Stand Up::What in the flying f u c k did you even just say? You made up your own language? Are you one of those high and mighty hipsters? You sound like the biggest tool known to man. Somehow I doubt you're a student of linguistics considering you sound like a three year old talking about creating a secret language with your imaginary friends.
Michel de Nostradame::if i'm a 3 year old. i must be the smartest fn 3 year old on the planet:) on your knees mofo and respect intellect lmao
Michel de Nostradame::Yes "conversate" is a word. This is not the debate. The issue is whether it is proper English or slang. If dictionaries describe it with adjectives such as "slang", "ignorant", or "uneducated", and the population accepts these associations, then those who use it risks being seen the same. I fear that acceptance of slang as proper grammar undermines the user in at least one crucial arena: the potential for upward mobility. But then that is JMHO! Slang as in...chi town stand up....ALSO In my humble Opinion you Sir is the biggest idiot on this board. how can I state facts about any NBA topic when you choose to go off-topic lmao. stupid as a stupid does...oh let me stop you might word police that too
Michel de Nostradame::This coming from a tool with the name "CHI Town Stand UP" you're not smooth Playa. You're not fooling anybody. You're a maggot in every sense of the word. you feast on what you percieve is fear. you're the sef proclaimed regulator of NOTHING. you're about nothing and won't amount to NOTHING. after reading this, look into yourself and all around you and i'm sure you'll come to the shocking realization.....you guessed it....you're nothing...simply nothing
SdotPaul504::I know"I loath god" is just trolling, his account was made 2 days ago. This "Michel de Nostradame" guy cant be a respectable NBA fan look at his favorite teams lmao
Michel de Nostradame::You're right i'm not your typical NBA fan. If you're perceptive enough you could easily identify me. regardless my friend it's been real. keep on trucking and happy trails yo
SdotPaul504::Yea bro that guys a joke lmao
Chi Town Stand Up::hahahah Holy sh.it I think he has every team in the playoffs last year as his favorite team lol
wrhank01::In this thread: Fans of college teams that didn't have anthony davis that got spanked.
Chi Town Stand Up::@Michel de Nostradame The word is "converse" not "conversate" maybe if these "grown folks" would stop saying idiotic things and sounding like illiterate re.$@%!$ I wouldn't have stepped in to expose your stupidity. You're wrong, and you're stupid. Bad combination.
Chi Town Stand Up::Michel de Nostradame - I absolutely love it when i put a muthaf**** in his place. you illiterate degenerate had no comeback whatsoever for my reply. feast on the sad, pathetic,attempt to "run with the best"  today is the saddest day of your life because you have been exposed word POPO  I just did look at the bottom of the thread. How am I the illiterate one when I haven't made a single grammatical error. Not sure why the "best" is considered to be a fairweather fan who makes easy spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes, backs up his points with no facts, and makes up his own little languages like a 3 year old with imaginary friends.
Michel de Nostradame::I absolutely love it when i put a muthaf**** in his place. you illiterate degenerate had no comeback whatsoever for my reply. feast on the sad, pathetic,attempt to "run with the best"  today is the saddest day of your life because you have been exposed word POPO
Michel de Nostradame::As a student of linguistics I've never been a language purist, I believe that if people use a word and others accept it is a word regardless of whether or not the language police accept it, or even put it in a dictionary....BOOOOOOOOOM..you're a follower not a leader...burn your own trail grasshopper
Joeblack1700::No @ I loathe god
Joeblack1700::You probably never even played bball ever trying stunt junior varsity guy senior year smh
Chi Town Stand Up::me?
Chi Town Stand Up::oh and stop liking your own posts.
CLTBraves12::Pot meet kettle.
Michel de Nostradame::dude really tho that sh** about people liking their own post is fn lame. go sit the fu** down and let grown folks conversate. internet tough guy
Michel de Nostradame::100% agreed Anthony Davis aint &amp;***. Gilchrist has more upside to his game. Haters with low BB IQ can hate all they want to but in a few years we'll see. ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE A BUST
Joeblack1700::Really how can he be a bust if u average 20 pts 10 Rebs n 1.5  blocks really your must don't  know much bout basketball
Chi Town Stand Up::you're stupid. I like the Bobcats, they're my second favorite team behind my bulls, but there's no way Gilchrist has more upside because AD is already a top 10 PF. He doesn't even have to improve that much to be the best PF in the league in 3 or 4 seasons.
Chi Town Stand Up::Yeah compare him to one of the best shot blockers in NBA history guess what he averaged his first two full seasons? 1.1 and 1.3 BPG.
sgafsetomorpnpse::Your IQ is not that impressive
popdaddy1518::dude go somewhere and shut up
sgafsetomorpnpse::Rivers is making small gains too. Small improvements each game.
Talentsojhin::If Biyombo had some hands lol.
sgafsetomorpnpse::Skynet is a beast
Chi Town Stand Up::Al Farouq Aminu for most improved, the brow for ROTY, and Ryan Anderson for Sixth man of the year if this keeps up. That's coming from an impartial watcher that's a bulls fan.
Talentsojhin::AD looked good, but I wish Haywood played so I could see him against a mediocre defensive center.
I loathe God::anthony davis is the next greg oden. not impressed so far
popdaddy1518::A double double with 4 blocks, what are u looking  for?
Chi Town Stand Up::Yeah and his 1.5 BPG. Man how unimpressive.
whodattrackgeauxtigers::Me neither. Putting up 20 points in the only 2 games he's finished so far hasn't been impressive at all.
phillie phanatic13::MKG for ROY
Chi Town Stand Up::Can I put in my vote for the Brow as ROTY yet? I think he's already won.
Chi Town Stand Up::Yeah seriously he's the best defender by a good country mile. Not only that, but he dominates at his position, he doesn't just start as it.
whodattrackgeauxtigers::But Brow Brow is so far ahead of everyone else in this deep class, it's not even funny.
whodattrackgeauxtigers::No cause the media's riding Lilliard's hollow stats.
Michel de Nostradame::wow 2 less turnovers by the Bobcats, someone else pick up the offense to compliment Ben's outburst and we have us a Ballgame
SdotPaul504::gg
Chi Town Stand Up::How are the Cats still in this... Ben Gordon is a one man army...
ooboh::@hornets247's avatar looks awesome.
SdotPaul504::HornetsReport.com is even more awesome lol
whodattrackgeauxtigers::they go hand-in-hand lol
whodattrackgeauxtigers::check out hornets247.com. It's awesome.
whodattrackgeauxtigers::all hornets all the time.
CamOverRG3::Ben Gordon one of NBA's most unpredictable players,he'll give you 30 one night and 6 another night
ooboh::Wow, the Bobcats are losing, but at least the games are close. Bobcats fans should be happy if a loss is decided by that little.
phillie phanatic13::Nobody is talking about Anthony Davis except for hornets fans saying U mad? How does it feel? Wel he go his $@%! throw by bis and MKG is playing better so Uhhh $@%!
Scandanavian Swisher::<b>BOBCATS FAN FOR LIFE! (god save me) =)</b>
Scandanavian Swisher::<b>That awkward moment when you are rooting against your favorite team, or at least what used to be your team.</b>
Talentsojhin::Yeah look how loyal the fans are. Is there even 8k people in there?
PorqueEstasEnojado::hey, blame george shinn...he tried to sell em on us too, but good thing we had tom benson here to buy 'em so they can stay here
PorqueEstasEnojado::we got your old team, and the player u wanted #1...lol
I loathe God::mean
Scandanavian Swisher:::(
mtboger::Mullens is so terrible.
ANTHYPE187::Bobcats need an athletic big man!  ASAP
PorqueEstasEnojado::How yall bobcats fans like watchin Anthony Davis play for us? haha...oh, what could've been...u mad?
Reddog7786::Brian Roberts is a player
