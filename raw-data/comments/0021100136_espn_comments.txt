Malcyon1::Bucks get creamed without Bogut but as soon as he comes back they beat a playoff contender.  Therefore, Bogut = MVP.
boudz::share what your smoking please
Constantinius III::Just as I was about to urge that Captain Jack be sent to the glue factory, that's how bad his game was, he surprises us...
dazeofwar::Congrats to the Bucks. Spurs defense is atrocious.
milw-jay::Bogut for MVP
WNBA.fan-365::It's okay Spurs!
Tim Buck II::Great win BUCKS!
SDTRIAZTEC::Great game Kawhi! Lets go Spurs. Need to pull out the W next time!  From an admitted new Spurs fan...(In my defense, I never paid much attention to the NBA before, so I had no real loyalties)
Bala88::Stephen jackson went off, good to have Bogut back, those that bag him, how many games did we win while he was away?
swaggamento916::the spurs need to find some youth
profess619::Kawhi Leonard put in work!  Give him minutes and you will see he is a star!!!
Txboy12345::wth is their bench? They arn't the top 5 oldest teams in the league and they just need their youth to get better together.
rentedduckling6::Holy $@%! Jackson did not see this coming... Didn't even know their was a bucks game today after the Bucks losing streak I just stoped watching
squiddy45::Typical
neozeak::I can look at the box score and see the reason for the loss.  Spurs didn't give Danny Green enough minutes.  He's a defensive stopper and he fills up the stat sheet.  While Manu is out he should be getting 15-20 minutes a game.
rossboss77::kawhi leonard is a beast
squiddy45::Not a huge upset
devin8442::Hey guys, random question, but since your all sports fans, have any of you used bookyourathlete.com to book an event or try and promote something of yours with a professional athlete for cheap? One of my friends brother used it and said it was awesome and really cheap but I just wanted to hear any other opinions from you guys. It looks pretty cool and that you can get an athlete to promote one of your items for only $300 or so but I just wanted to see who else used them. Thanks in advance for your help I really appreciate it!
Way Klaro::Get a real job! Nice try!
Edward4515::Dam I wanted the bucks to head to the lottery, dont repeat last year &amp; "win" games to miss out on the playoffs by a few games.
Mulla0722::They've played way way way better than their record. They've got to get over the second half collapses though. They've been tied or led almost every game at the half. The only true BUTT WHOOPIN' was against the Suns and that was on the back end of that road trip and honestly I think they just wanted it all to be over. Still missing Mike Dunleavy and Mbah a Moute. Can't we just all be healthy for once!
squiddy45::They're making the playoffs
squiddy45::They will, I said after Sunday's loss and I'm saying it again. I'll write on your wall once they clinch
D Stag::And then you woke up
Milwaukee Buckss::still could happen i mean they are only 3-6.
reconize333::like i said the only mistake here is you
Milwaukee Buckss::Thats not what your 79 year old mom said
reconize333::now you sound stupid
Milwaukee Buckss::Holy $@%! your first post with no mistakes
reconize333::with your ugly a s s baby
tplushh4lifee::stop liking our own comments
tplushh4lifee::M son picks up more women than you ever will haha
reconize333::how is going to get worst nerd
tplushh4lifee::This guy is a bum
reconize333::i dont understand why you like man
Milwaukee Buckss::Nah hes just $@%!$@%!
tdawg44446::don't drink and post at the same time dude.
tplushh4lifee::Your making yourself sound stupid. You should stop before it get's worst
reconize333::se you were blackout so you didnt know what happen may you got f u c k in the a s s
Milwaukee Buckss::Illiterate piece of crap
tplushh4lifee::man you grammar sucks. No wonder your mother didn't want you
Milwaukee Buckss::I DONT UNDERSTAND YOU
PeterPPK::It's about freaking time that the Bucks beat a good opponent. However, they need to play like this every day. THAT would make me a happy man.
reconize333::my mom is 79 years old so if you f u c k her it must be har for you to get p u s s y
PhillyFlya::You forgot the letter G in your screen name but then i saw all the grammatical errors so i take it that's just "you".
tplushh4lifee::or she could have had him at 50 lol. after having him she was like aww s.hit what was i thinking having sex and delivering this ugly thing
Milwaukee Buckss::So that means your around 50 years old and your grammar is at the level of a 12 year old. Good for you!!!!!!!!!
tplushh4lifee::thats why i said it was a mistake. i was blacked out. than woke up and was like oh s.hit i slept with this hag
reconize333::ginobli did not play and the only mistake here is your mom having you
Milwaukee Buckss::Nope, you forgot the period.
tplushh4lifee::the only mistake is me sleeping with your mom
reconize333::there were missing giniobli bucks plays at home you people the one who dont know anything
doc_acc::Actually, it's Ginobili
clogee::Manu could have played and dropped 50 and we still would have lost cuz the dam Bucks own us.  Only team with a winning record against Timmey.
Milwaukee Buckss::They were*  Ginobli*  played*  God damn so many mistakes including your name
Edward4515::guess the spurs shouldve let the bucks have the lead heading into 3rd/4th quarter
nba is the worst::chucking spurs...
Milwaukee Buckss::Stephen Jackson is what happened
Lakerevolution::You mean 'bucking' spurs . . .
jcmaggi::Jesus what happened?
nba is the worst::5 more threes won it for the Bucks
vnguy9879::Nothing is real in these games. They play for Vegas and nba make money. Under 91.5 2H was the fix. I could see that so obvious.
Mulla0722::My goodness the Spurs shot 60%, how often do you do that and lose...
Milwaukee Buckss::Timmy D and parker wouldnt miss a god damn shot lol
clogee::I was about to write the same exact thing.
nickblackfur::dam both teams shot good......real good lol....i hope its just a good sign for the bucks.....but idk lol.....
Milwaukee Buckss::A win is always a good sign for the Bucks
bhintage77::Stephen Jackson has the biggest mouth I have ever seen!  Size wise I bet he could fit Shaq's foot in his mouth with room to spare!
clogee::35 wasted minutes by Timmey and Ford lost with yet another injury.  We're never gonna win on the road this year and the Rockets will prolly smoke us tomorrow night.  Hurry the F**k up Manu!!!
Milwaukee Buckss::Can i get a like for Jacksons performance tonight Bucks fans??
Milwaukee Buckss::lol
bhintage77::After I get done parking my car in his mouth. lol.
Mulla0722::Spurs 6-0 Home 0-4 Away - Bucks 3-0 Home 0-6 Away
