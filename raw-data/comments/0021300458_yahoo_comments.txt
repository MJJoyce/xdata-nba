Ric::The Jazz front office needs to fire Tyrone Corbin.  Either he is too stupid to understand he is supposed to be developing his players (Kanter, Favors, Burke, Burks and Hayward) or he is too worried about losing his job so he has to win games now.  The front office needs to sit him down and give his reassurance that he will not lose his job if he follows the long-term plan, if that has been done and he is still employed then the Millers need to change the front office personnel too.
Carolinacompanycowboy::Bobcats gotta slap that net on the slippery fish to drain the basket and get some points that mount to a win.
Rebecca::The Jazz are going to win Charlotte by 10 points tonight. I see the Jazz winning 3 in a row this week. Jefferson is a great player and I wish the best for him while he is playing for Charlotte.
Tony H::Charlotte is getting almost nothing from both the 3 and the 4.  It is hard to win that way.
Vlad::only 6 shots for favors. ridiculous. come on coach
Dave H::Bobcats need to drive the ball to the paint! to many outside shots
Go Hard or Go Home::A. Jeff will dominate the jazz fosho!
Dany::I don't understand why the coach doesn't play BEN GORDON!!!!
brett::Jazz for the win, Charlotte is a slave state. Please watch the MIND BENDING THUMB BENDING video on Youtube for information on the conspiracy to destroy the black race. Thank you.
steve::How can Favors suck so much.  Six touches and two boards against NO D Jefferson?  #$%$!!!
