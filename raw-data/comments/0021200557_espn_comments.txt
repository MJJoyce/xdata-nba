candycane316::rondo looked like the best PG in the nba last night
Jimmy30313::He is the best
oblique15::Any trade they make should include Collins  That guy is Elite garbage  He can foul I geuss lol  so what, I could too for 900k  I would pull peoples arms, kick, trip, whatever I have to do  Call me dirties player lol
HoldOnMyHeart::Ive been using this online betting system called SportsBettingStar the last 2 months now.  Im making approximately $3000 per month just following the system.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Well, can't honestly say I expected to win this one. Proud of the effort the team gave tonight though. I was wondering why Celtic fans were so adamant about keeping Bradley, but now I know. I always knew that he was a lock down defender, but with that three point shot going down like its been this year, you gotta say he's one of the better value players in the leauge. Aaron Affalo 2.0, with the potential to be even better.
_I Am A Celtic_::Good job, good effort
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::They tried. Celtics just got that veteran savvy though. That's why I think they'll still be a threat when the playoffs come around. Miami has been looking pretty garbage lately too.
Pavel0636::KG say we all melt and we did " now they are playing like last years 6 wins streak " what now "
_I Am A Celtic_:::)
fbbscr10::the boston boobcats stink worse thany my aunt debra's $@%!$
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::I honestly can't tell if that's a shot at Boston or Charlotte. Good job clown.
Cambo...Rambo::Boston Celtics have three Kings in the NBA;  1. Rajon Rondo 2. Paul Pierce 3. Kevin Garnett
Crooklynism::Im not a boston fan but its scary to think that they have several trade pieces they can offer to a team for someone out there.  I would go after shooters, take the load off Pierce
Sports rules::Celtics win bammmmmmmmm
abdiraxman79::rondo is the john coltrane of point guards,
KeithStone.x392::Negro?
millermitch::The Celtics are 4 games back with 45 to go. Everything is fine. Calm down kids, it's January!!!
iamjayee::If Ainge will TRADE Paul Pierce...   I WILL BE A MIAMI HEATLESS TROLLS FAN!
zeller2395::Celtics are undefeated when Avery STARTS this year. First game he didn't start and they lost.
Doug8349::celtics nation, i jus got done hounded the heat bradley waitn on wade
Fuerza del Norte::Looks as though Avery Bradley might really be a "savior" of sorts for the Celtics.  You can't argue with their success since he's come back.
Fuerza del Norte::Bold prediction: Boston will win the Eastern Conference.
DISGORGY::I want Rondo over any other PG.  He's durable, champ experience, and a triple double machine.  Imagine if he had a Durant to pass it to.  Or even prime versions of KG and Pierce.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::This is why I feel like Rondo is only second to CP3 as far as PGs in the leauge. And considering his durability, as far as overall impact over the past few years, Rondo has no rivals.
Shaun0088::Also an improving shooter (He's never been one).
Seven seconds of pleasure::Celtics now just 4.5 games out of 1st in the East  Lakers still 4 games out of 8th in the West  ;-)
Road dog Red::Yawn
Dr Chim Richalds OBGYN::why on earth does rajon look so angry all the time?
Jimmy30313::haha he's expression never changes
Chex Lemeneux 9::What? No steals for Sullinger?
TresMilagro::Boston will be in first sometime early Feb. Book it.
Dr Chim Richalds OBGYN::but i won't be on hallucinogenics...

Jimmy30313::Anyone wanna fill me in this CandySparker dude? Doesn't seem too popular around here
_I Am A Celtic_::Basically a huge toolbag
mcase2012::Rondo for MVP
CandySparker::
364Terry::Get outta hereeeeee
_I Am A Celtic_::get lost scumbag
Budd1087::Charlotte Bobcats  Where losing happens
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::It's pretty typical of rebuilding teams to be losing games like this early in the process. I'm happy with our plan though. Walker and MKG are foundational pieces, Bismack is coming along. We played this game without Mullens or Tyrus. Jeff Taylor is a solid second round pick. I'm happy for the future. And this losing ensures us another high pick with a shot at another cornerstone in the draft. Get all the jokes out the way now because in about 2-3 years, they are going to be a problem.
CandySparker::Too loose
Shaun0088::Thats what she said.
_I Am A Celtic_::GO TO HELL
Paul Pierce is the TRUTH::Paul Pierce is the TRUTH
CandySparker::
_I Am A Celtic_::shutup you piece of sh.it

_I Am A Celtic_::Yup
InCubaWith2Pac14::If I was MJ, eveybody would be on the trade block.
InCubaWith2Pac14::even kemba walker lol
InCubaWith2Pac14::Bobcats fans, would yall rather have steph Curry, or kemba Walker?
AGirlThatLovesSports_::kemba ^___^

Fear the Gr0nk::Why start Celtics in fighting?
PP owns Rondo::Lol
13Datty40Zetty::good game from the boys, didn't get to watch any though.
PP owns Rondo::Pats haven't won sh1+ since Spygate. Expect that to continue this weekend.

Fear the Gr0nk::Panthers haven't won shit.   Expect that to continue this weekend.
PP owns Rondo::I blame spygate for that.
Alabamian666::Xiu Li is the only one who knows about basketball on this board. The Celtics are headed for disaster and here come the nineties all over again.
Jimmy30313::The Celtics will never go away
cadillac147::yeahhhhhh okkkkkk
