b10you::D-Rose is the biggest p@$$y in the NBA. Been cleared for a month and still hasn't played. Someone needs to tell him to its like riding a horse. You get bucked off you get back on. The longer he sits the more confidence he loses.
Rahul1671::Granger
Rahul1671::Hah, what happened to the Pacer fans promising a victory. A bunch of bs. We won without our two best players.
Taco has a Q::and the Pacers two best scorers too
Anthony85208::So Bulls beat pacers with 3 of their starters not playing, wtf?? gj Bulls
Double-..Cheese::Noah was out and yeah we are missing that guy called Rose, you know the MVP player. stop crying . lol
Double-..Cheese::granger is not an an mvp player like Rose. lol
hoops 112hoping::Oh really, is that why our offense is routinely terrible and our bench sucks? Your bench is extremely good and I respect how good it is but ours is actually pretty bad, maybe 2nd worst ahead of only the blazers. Arguably our best player off the bench is a 2nd round rookie named Orlando Johnson. With Granger, our offense would be above average and he would score at least double digits off the bench.
Double-..Cheese::bulls are a playoff team and above 500 and just beat the pacers without their all star center. their doing good without an MVP player. Ranger Granger doesn't have the impact Rose has. he is a scrub compared to Rose  and clearly wasn't that big of a deal
hoops 112hoping::No you stop crying about your injuries, honestly we don't care if we're injured we're a still a top team in this league with or without Granger, but you guys aren't without Rose. Too bad for you guys that you can't keep the same level of play without your best player, but other teams can.
Double-..Cheese::i lie how he lists a bunch of excuses  and then says no excuses. lol
Double-..Cheese::dude bulls have been so beat up all year. you guys now say big deal we won 3 but how many of those wins were against a healthy bulls team?. the last time the pacers won it was close and the bulls had an 8 man squad. can't have it both ways son . stop crying
hoops 112hoping::yeah the Pacers had Granger and West out, Hill injured in the groin area after the 2nd half, and our best player couldn't dribble with his left hand because of a sprained ligament. I don't care about excuses though, as long as you guys stop whining with that same excuse everytime.
Double-..Cheese::well looks like the bulls still own the pacers
BoilermakerDiesel::That's why they only won one game vs the Pacers this year?
Double-..Cheese::why you got an MVP out?
hoops 112hoping::lol you realize we aren't healthy either right?
Double-..Cheese::thats not crying it's fact. the pacers are only better if the bulls are not healthy. lol
hoops 112hoping::So what, we had injuries too. STOP WHINING! no one cares about your injuries. stop crying double cheese
Double-..Cheese::you guys are better when we are missing one of the best players in the game. lol real impressive. lol
hoops 112hoping::Bulls fans love living in the past, everyone knows that. We're much better than you guys this season, and it's not even debatable. Next season, it will be close.
Double-..Cheese::remember when the pacers beat the bulls in the playoffs? me neither
loochey03::Is tyler a bum or what, he had about 4 flagrant 1's. also, Nate's foul was a  flagrant one. watch it closer he seems to dramatize it.
Jaguarcrazyboy::Great win for CHI.  They show up to play no matter whose playing. Good job fellas.
FeFyeFoeRun::Heat are winning it all. None of these teams can beat the heat in a 7 game series.
tigel18::You never know.  The Spurs most definitely can.  I think the Knicks could do it as well.
OmniVersal::Yeah I remember when they said the same thing when it was Heat vs Mavs. How did that work out?
brentmc111111::Good hard NBA game.  Looking forward to a healthy David West back in the lineup.  Big Roy starting to play some good ball!
Derek2384::I am glad the Bulls could finally beat these guys this year.
crimson_dynasty::biggest career knee bust fa.aggo.try.  Derrick Rose.
disney will now ruin star wars::pffffttt.........this guy^^^   In one statement he says DR epitomized weakness of character and then comes back with a career knee injury line. Sounds like a hater troll db to me.
nehemiah9ER::hahaha u mad!!!
Jaguarcrazyboy::When you got to whine you just got to whine...
crimson_dynasty::hahaha u scared.  Horrific knee injury.  Ongoing pain and discomfort.  Great track record of players with similar injuries.
crimson_dynasty::Epitomizing weakness of character = Derrick Rose    How many championships?
Bumslayer86::Apparently RG3 is gonna come back before Rose.. Maybe Rose should get some fire in his body or perhaps a real trainer instead of turning this into an 18 month injury
Skip Mindless::Good Gosh BULLS!! Can't you guys play a game without injuring yourselves?
slay_rockstarr::That's what make them the bulls. They can play through injuries and still win games.
Bumslayer86::"Rose rolling dice at the casino NO"
Taco has a Q::I still see the Pacers taking the 2nd seed in the east,  Knicks (despite still playing the Bobcats twice) have a BRUTAL schedule from here on out!
AL Central is A Joke But Go Whitesox::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAA8mLz8aJ0
CHITOWNBULLS1991::"is there a medic in the house?!"
ArticSquarecle::I would never visit Chicago. Unless I was in an armored vehicle wearing a bullet-proof vest.
CHITOWNBULLS1991::then you've obviously never been there. Only certain parts of the city are dangerous, most of it is actually very nice.
NGplayinskillz::Naw, I've been there many. Most of the city is dangerous. Bout the safest part is the Northside.
MasterOfLogic::Oh, we lost anoter close game? That's real shocking.
Taco has a Q::Games like that I wish West played, but oh well
IversonDaGreatest3::.
geeman217::Ok I'm out...  Pacer fans.  This little 4-game roadie is gonna tell a lot about your team, the rest of the season.  *Honest* assessment.    Your team hasn't been faring well against the good teams lately.  Good luck
Taco has a Q::We play the Rockets, Suns and Mavs.   Then the Clippers.   I dont see it being too hard tho the Pacers dont play all that great on the road
Taco has a Q::I want revenge on the Clips for sure
CHITOWNBULLS1991::probably 3-1, I could see 4-0 and you beating the Clippers but all 4 being on the road is tough.
geeman217::How do you extrapolate this-  "Taco has a Q And your trying to dispute the fact that he is still a 1st ballot HOF? lol nice try" _____________ From this- "And he wasn't even the best-  "Miller" in his family." _________ Somebody help me here...
Taco has a Q::You say a lot of petty sh.it agianst the Pacers, only god knows what the hell goes through your head
SFCROB1369::Extrapolate is a pretty big word for this board.
Area55andG2::I have to agree with geeman
geeman217::Yeah- you're right.  these are Indiana fans..
SFCROB1369::Good job Bulls. How many did Rose score o wait I forgot I he just collects his 15K a game check these days.
SFCROB1369::As well as I thought they would.
sportsnu36::Yep,thats what Boston does well------LOSE
SFCROB1369::It is my job to care Bulls fans are so touchy feely.
sportsnu36::Thats to bad,because I'm sure your'e not getting paid on this job.
geeman217::We're doing ok w/o your assistance...  How'd Boston do tonight???
geeman217::When did you start signing his paychecks?  And- why do you care?
SFCROB1369::The difference is Rondo is still hurt. But I bet Rondo plays meaningful minutes before Rose does.
Area55andG2::Rose has soreness in his knee. They are both injured. I'm not even a Bulls fan, I just think your hypocritical
Area55andG2::kinda like Rondo
Taco has a Q::Butler sure let one get away tonight, even tho thats just another team out of the tourney that has beaten IU
Area55andG2::couldn't believe Rotni took that shot. It didn't even look to be a rhythm shot
rk6326::Tyson Chandler and Eddie Curry are better than Reggie Miller. Some 16 year old on his parent's computer just confirmed this.
geeman217::You Pacer fans might wanna drink another Bud...  You're getting a little too sensitive...  Ya making up shhhed
Area55andG2::woah woah woah, let's not get too sensitive. But I have a solution for you. do it like this you may be able to get your point across more effectively. shi.t
geeman217::Area55andG2 - never heard the expression   "making up shhhed" ____________ YOU DO realize that you can't type the word s-h-i-t  here right????
bycrackyrules77::Something tells me yor're re....$@%!...ed?
Area55andG2::never heard the expression   "making up shhhed"
bycrackyrules77::and you'd be wrong!!
iownamicrowave::I remember when the bulls had tyson chandler and eddy curry.. the glory years
geeman217::I remember when the Pacers had Reggie Miller.  The d0nut years...  oh wait...
Area55andG2::thanks geeman for offering a hug. A sign of true character
Taco has a Q::Sure sounded like your finding a way to
geeman217::Taco has a Q - And your trying to dispute the fact that he is still a 1st ballot HOF?   lol nice try _________________________ DID i say that?  simmer down dude.  You need a hug?
Taco has a Q::And your trying to dispute the fact that he is still a 1st ballot HOF?   lol nice try
geeman217::Taco has a Q - First ballot HOF buddy _____________ And he wasn't even the best-  "Miller" in his family
Taco has a Q::Very cool
bycrackyrules77::Cool^^
Taco has a Q::First ballot HOF buddy
Taco has a Q::I didnt think Chandler would be as good as he is now.
bycrackyrules77::Still better than the glory years of Reggie Miller!
Taco has a Q::Moron!  Miller was a multi-time all star!   Miller was good enough tho his team wasn't.  FK.ing idiot!!
bycrackyrules77::So not being "good Enough" is more of a feat to you?  MORON!
Taco has a Q::Miller has 0 rings, but is a HOF which is more of a feat to me
bycrackyrules77::Chandler, Curry or Miller won nothing....
Taco has a Q::Dont even compare Chandler and Curry to Reggie Miller
rk6326::That's debatable.
Taco has a Q::Looks like Cook may have an ACL tear tonight, I couldnt see the injury clearly tho
geeman217::Left thigh bruise  Doc...
Taco has a Q::Is that what it was?
Old joker toker::Thanks doc
Taco has a Q::Way to like your own post!  And Im going by what I see.  Seeing a player being helped into the locker room sure isnt a good sign
Area55andG2::calm down geez.
bycrackyrules77::My 3 year old&gt;tyler hansbrough
bycrackyrules77::When A Corn Fell  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFKuKSsWcBI
bycrackyrules77::instead of an acorn fell??
Taco has a Q::Gonzaga lost tonight, no surprise!!  They are a joke for a #1 team
iownamicrowave::Lets compare players....   Boozer and Vin Baker
Old joker toker::I heard Detroit is on fire?? Any news?
rk6326::Wouldn't surprise me one bit.
iownamicrowave::I speak one language.  That language is love.
Skip Mindless::Boozer &gt; Odom  ala Odom's one point, one rebound, one assist performance for the Mavs.
Taco has a Q::that was random
DBrownDrose::pacers fans i say lets just drop the hate
Taco has a Q::Im just saying the Bulls have overachieved a ton this season, but it seems like they are gassed and injury plagued.  They even lost Cook tonight.  I just dont see how you guys think you will contend for the title this year.  Next year is a whole new story depending on the offseason.   I think my Pacers will go as far as the ECF.  I dont think we beat the Heat but I sure as hell would like to see this team try.
DBrownDrose::lol
Taco has a Q::Glad your not a blind man...lol
DBrownDrose::i see
Taco has a Q::Yes and I admire that, but I dont get the Pacers hate and doubt.  If the Pacers have EVEN ANY CHANCE against Miami if we get there.  We have GOT to score the ball more efficient!!!
DBrownDrose::thats all we can ask for is to try
Taco has a Q::I agree totally
DBrownDrose::thats good
rk6326::Has it gotten to you?
DBrownDrose::im just saying that bulls and pacers fans really dislike eachother
rk6326::The Hate
DBrownDrose::what has?
Old joker toker::Have they posted what time the parade is Monday ?
rshawnk::Thank you "post police"
Taco has a Q::I cant tell who he likes?
geeman217::Generally You don't *like* your own posts...
geeman217::Old joker toker - geeman217 - Old joker toker - Don't call me general.  _______________ Ok  Yo-kel Hick...  Wow a true wordsmith. Brilliant _____________ And- I don't *like* my own comments...
Old joker toker::geeman217 - Old joker toker - Don't call me general.  _______________ Ok  Yo-kel Hick...  Wow a true wordsmith. Brilliant
geeman217::Old joker toker - Don't call me general.  _______________ Ok  Yo-kel Hick...
Old joker toker::Don't call me general. It's sir
Taco has a Q::Whos they?
Old joker toker::Who you
iownamicrowave::Dude, once I was at a party and joakim noah was there.  He didnt represent the bulls organization well
bob964::You pacers fans are so damn lame.
Taco has a Q::Explain why, if you can
Area55andG2::I bet he tells the worst knock knock jokes
Area55andG2::I see what you did there with the sarcasm
DBrownDrose::haha good one not
geeman217::*yawn*
geeman217::rk6326 - Go to sleep it's late. _____________ Shouldn't you be sleep?  Who's gonna open up the 7-11??? Milk the Cows?
rk6326::Go to sleep it's late.
scabbfan::Hillarious seeing little Robinson Punk Stephenson.   lmao West &amp; stephenson dirty players &amp; punks...nice to see some payback.
Area55andG2::Bulls = first round exit
iownamicrowave::West  and stephensons are dirty players? how many times are they ejected for flagrants.... NEVER
Taco has a Q::West dirty???   Thats a new one on me
DBrownDrose::stephenson was surprised haha
Taco has a Q::Any Hoosiers going for IU this tourney?
Taco has a Q::Only team that has a chance to knock off IU before the final 4 is Miami FL
rk6326::Go Temple
DBrownDrose::no cause indiana sucks
Taco has a Q::Only Michigan team I root for is the Detroit Red Wings
Taco has a Q::OVERRATED!!!   ESP Michigan
DBrownDrose::? i know but i root for uni of michigan
Taco has a Q::I said Hoosiers, not hood rat Chicago scum
Area55andG2::I don't even consider Paul to be "the guy" on this team. The Pacers work around the foundation of a team's mindset.
iownamicrowave::I laughed so hard when i saw boozer
bycrackyrules77::cool story!
bycrackyrules77::No problem....I laughed so hard at your comment!
iownamicrowave::THSANKSS BRA
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Nuggets are 32-3 at home...who's gonna beat Denver in a 7 game series if tey get home court advantage...only San Antonio
rk6326::Thunder, Clippers. Both have more talent...so there is a chance.
rk6326::He said that already.
bycrackyrules77::Spurs?
Area55andG2::counting the heat out just spews ignorance
Area55andG2::oh gotcha. Well I still disagree with that, but not as thoroughly as before
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::im talkin about West not East teams
DBrownDrose::paul george is your future thats it
Taco has a Q::DE LU SON AL ^^^^
rk6326::Yeah and I don't know if you have watched him or anything, but that's a pretty good future.
Taco has a Q::-said only one person ever
DBrownDrose::bulls have a better one
Area55andG2::Pacers fans actually did research. Maybe you should do the same.
Taco has a Q::Again what the hell is your point??
DBrownDrose::cause you live in indiana
Taco has a Q::^^^what did he say?  Cause I sure didnt quite catch the logic in that
DBrownDrose::and indiana fans have 20 more min before their internet is done for the day
Area55andG2::LOL
Taco has a Q::Bulls fans have the logic of a rock
Taco has a Q::I laughed so hard when I saw a Bulls fan say they have a brighter future than the Pacers,  ESP if Rose isnt the same player then not a  chance.   Having a hurt Rose, Boozer, Hinrich, Hamilton, Nazr, Robinson, and Deng who may be gone is NOT a bright future
geeman217::I laughed so hard  seeing Boozer DUNK on Hibbert...
Taco has a Q::Boozer is a bum on D
geeman217::Taco has a Q - That wasnt that impressive, he threw the ball down ___________ Stopped laughing???
Taco has a Q::That wasnt that impressive, he threw the ball down
iownamicrowave::Besides Rose? the Bulls have a bunch of marginal players and older fellows?  How did luol deng make the all star team over David West?
Taco has a Q::Butler, Gibson, Noah (Pending Rose) is all you really have
Taco has a Q::Yet the Pacers avg age is younger than the Bulls... Eat that bi.tch
DBrownDrose::delusional
Taco has a Q::Better than your squad, thats for sure
DBrownDrose::hahahahaahahahahaha look at who u just named
Taco has a Q::Lance Stevenson?  Orlando Johnson?  Hill?  Hibbert?  Hansbrogh? Mahinmi too he's only 26 who will back up Roy for a while
DBrownDrose::and mirotic and bobcats pick all you got is george
DBrownDrose::i said it and i'll stick with it
Area55andG2::and you'll eat it.
Taco has a Q::Your an unrealistic homer, you dont count
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::So which team do you think is winning the Championship?? My pick is the Denver Nuggets and then I get to see Melo and all the Knick fans cry
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Thunder hav no Harden, Clippers are just a great regular season team, and Indiana won't slow down the best offensive team in the league
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::I only agreed with Miami and San Antonio...
rk6326::See there's where you lose some credibility. I could put 5-6 teams ahead of the Denver Nuggets at least.
rk6326::Thunder, Heat, Spurs, Clippers, Indiana (longshot). There they are big guy
Area55andG2::indy's a stretch though. Things would have to go right.
Area55andG2::OKC, SA, MIA, LAC, IND
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::and these teams are??
Eg214::CAN BULLS MANAGEMENT TELL ROSE DUDE U NEED TO START PLAYING GET UR SH II TT TOGETHER AND GET OUT ON THE COURT? DAM HES STILL ON THE PAYROLL GO EARN YOUR CHECK FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!
geeman217::Can we tell you to take off the cap lock???
iownamicrowave::Bennayyyyy BEnnaayyy da bullll ........ who wants me to stop talking?
rk6326::DBrownDrose sounds a little moody right now.
Taco has a Q::Lol he acts like he got a.ss raped in Indy and hates this city
DBrownDrose::ikr
geeman217::Pacers play Atlanta then have a nice 4-game road trip...  Let's see where   they are at AFTER the 4-game ROADIE...
Taco has a Q::Pacers play the Mavs and Suns this roadie too, and the Rockets who we killed at home
iownamicrowave::geeman217 - "Let's see where the Pacers are at AFTER the 4-game roadie.  *Object in your rear*-   may be closer than ya think.  Object in your rear..... :/
geeman217::"Let's see where the Pacers are at AFTER the 4-game roadie.  *Object in your rear*-   may be closer than ya think.
iownamicrowave::Bulls fans and Pacers fans, the tale of two cities.
iownamicrowave::Hello dear friends, I have arrived.
Area55andG2::yes iownamicrowave is here!
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Can't we all side together to take down the Heat?
macksolo::The Heat did it so it just might work. If The Bulls had Paul George or Paul Pierce with D. Rose healthy, Miami would be in trouble.
Area55andG2::didn't the Celtics start this free agent big 3 trend? Why would I want to side with you?
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::KG and Ray Allen weren't even in their primes wen tey got signed it was a shortlived fun 5 year run...
Area55andG2::continuing the troll mindset I see. It's getting uncreative
DBrownDrose::because no one wants pacers fans to side with them
rk6326::I do agree with you here.
rk6326::I have question...What is the Celtics fan doing here and why is he siding with the Bulls fans? Aren't you guys rivals or something?
bob964::Right now no. By 2014 they do. That's why i said FUTURE
bob964::Bulls have a brighter future than the pacers.
Taco has a Q::The hell they do!   Bulls are not good in their cap right now
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::And tere comes the luxury tax
Area55andG2::Pacer relevance brings enemies together. It's touching, I know
Area55andG2::unless the Bulls splash big time in FA, they'll be going down the drain alot quicker than the pacers
DBrownDrose::no we just try to bring pacers fans back to realization and not imagination hahaha
macksolo::Too bad it'll only last for a year :-(
CHITOWNBULLS1991::Mutual Respect between 2 good teams.
AL Central is A Joke But Go Whitesox::because you have a very dislikable player in Hansbrough
bycrackyrules77::Cause they have a better chance in beating the Heat!
DBrownDrose::we just know that pacers fans are dumb
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::exactly
