screwhead2305::bad game
omgitswes::Monta is just so smooth. Love watching this dude play, sucks he'll probably never make an ASG now with Rose and Rondo in his same conference. Hopefully I'm wrong though
bk8368::where'd big z go................ i haven't seen him for ever
poodagg::he hates dan gilbert!  he doesnt even go to work because he cant stand the guy!
Carslon12::The Cavs MUST LOSE two out of three to Washington and Charlotte now....this blatant tank job by Toronto must be countered
Carslon12::This was a bad one to win, now the Cavs have to lose to New Jersey and the Nets are going to be battling for the loss. The Cavs have 5 games remaining where they have to battle for a loss: Nets , Charlotte(which will be next to impossible, as MJ has them in full suck mode) Washington twice, and Detroit. Those are five games that will be tough to get the loss, the other 8 the Cavs have zero chance of winning. Toronto  could end the season with 20 wins, and the Cavs could be battling for losses and still end with 23 wins...It's total scumbaggery on Toronto's part and will NOT be forgotten.
lamriverside13::Bynum got ejected again!! this kid needs to drop his balls and GROW UP!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsq2_Nqg0I8
bradonlywins::btw Alonzo Gee is brutal!
bradonlywins::Please Cavs keep winning and pass Raps in the standings! Who am i kidding though the draft is rigged and stern would never let Toronto get Anthony Davis.
stellablue2131::keep winning?  where have you been for the last 2 weeks?
martysparty2042::Cleveland rocks!!!
cajunriptide::What was it the owner said i belive it was the Cavs would win a championship before LeBron. At this rate they will never win one.
420floyd::yeah......right......since cleveland sports teams win titles all the time
Alex818728::Cavs will win before lebron, and before whatever city he plays for
MarkJ03::at this rate neither will LBJ
The Land of Cleve::Yea, finally beat toronto!  It's obvious what the Cavs are doing at this point, but this game shows that some of our guys do have potential, and could be role players in a great future team.
whitsok14::Memo to Cleveland: Let Irving heal and tank the rest of the season. Draft some studs and let the rebuilding continue
Carslon12::easier said than done when teams like Toronto are trying to outtank you, and you have a floor full of D-leaguers trying to play for a spot
mannys1fan::all i can say is damn jamison for being in a contract year.  This was a game the Cavs needed to lose, and were down by enough in the 4th Q...what were they thinking
Alex818728::why would any player tank, you really think they care about lottery chance their all playing for money and pride
Carslon12::The Cavs won. That’s a bad thing…..and it has nothing to do with magic, this aint’ Harry Potter, It was Toronto banking the Cavs D-leaguers wanting to prove themselves, and by letting it happen, it gains Toronto a key loss and a schedule advantage over the Cavs. Toronto wants to be in the top 4 or 5 in the lotto, and they don’t want the Cavs there. Toronto knows OKC, IND, PHI, BOS, ATL, ATL &amp; MIA are all playoff bound teams with incentive to win. These are all losable games for them, and that’s exactly what they plan to do, LOSE. Eight times in a row.
Paul6250::Unfortunately the Raptors team orders were to lose this game no matter what!!! Maybe this is why the game was the lowest scoring of all tonights games!!!
MarkJ03::what did coach scott get ejected for?? I didnt see the game.
DyersEve06::This win doesn't hurt our draft position. No way we can "catch" new Orleans, Charlotte or Washington at this point.
tom7810883::yah but the whole point is to stay in front of toronto theres a big difference between the 4th and 5th pick especially in this years draft
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Was this game so bad that even the trolls got nothing to say?
zackdaddy85::Lester hudson only player in college basketball history with a quad double http://espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=273172630   Top Performers Central Baptist Coll: R. Barnes 16 Pts, 7 Reb, 3 Ast, 1 Stl Tennessee-Martin: L. Hudson 25 Pts, 12 Reb, 10 Ast, 10 Stl, 1 Blk  that link will send you to the game
KingGeorge53::I'll make the assumption that Lester will start the next game.
zackdaddy85::in all his games that he gets time he does produce i dont know why people dont give him a bigger chance
Paul6250::I hope the Raptors made enjoy their "Sting" money ...this game was a total sham!! To have much more posession in the 4th Quarter n with only 40 seconds left n being outscored 30-8 after easily outscoring the Cavaliers in all the other 3 Quarters speaks for itself!!! An absolute disgrace!!
dbe100::i feel your pain brotha
Paul6250::Just a bit mad!! I had the Raptors -4 with the Pacers +4 n The Spurs -11.... But even just watching the game in the last quarter when the cavaliers had only scored 3 points I could see something odd...I was looking at all the other scores n like I say with 40 seconds left the Raptors had only scored 8 points..which was the lowest compared with every other game by a country mile!! Even a team of the blind could score more than 8 points after 11mins 20 seconds ...n against one of the worst defences in the league!!  Sure with 32 seconds left they decided to play n scored 9 points ..which made it look not quite as ridiculous..but surely someone should be asking WHY they could only score 8 points in almost a full quarter after scoring 20+ after 11mins in every other!!!
Alex818728::you mad bro
bk8368::u from fayette
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::How much did you lose tonight?
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::If the Cavs wanted to tank, Semih Erden would've started and had &gt;30 min.
NBA_refs_are_weak::luke walton has got to be the only player in the league that can play 9 minutes in a game and not record a SINGLE stat. not even a personal foul! literally 0's across the board LOL. good lord
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::He did get a "3" in the shots attempted column...
Bluejackets412::Finally!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Raptors shoot 42%, Cavs 34%. Raptors outrebound Cavs 49-39. Granted, the Rapts had 14 TOs to Cleveland's 6, so maybe that's how it happened.
cdro225::How beast would it be if we win the lottery this year again. Kyrie lob to Davis &gt; Paul lob to griffin.
cdro225::The Cavs should take RG3
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::He can specialize in last-second shots.
Paul6250::Was this some kind of betting scam??!!!  With 30 seconds left the Raptors had only scored 8 points in the Quarter!! N then make it look good by scoring 9 in 34 seconds!!!  Outscored by 16 by one of the worst teams in the league...Who are they trying to kid!!! If this game had been here in England here would be an inquiry for sure!!!  FIXED!!!
Paul6250::In name only I'm afraid...We are unfortunately governed by different laws n morals nowadays!!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Well, it did happen in Canada, which is still part of the Commonwealth, isn't it?
ZachRamsfelder::I'm a Cavs and Tar Heels fan...let's get Barnes!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I'm a Cavs fan. PERIOD. They take the best player they can even if he's from a regional culinary school.
Alex818728::not if were top 4
sambai23::maybe with the laker's pick....
sambai23::I'm a cavs and UNC fan too...and i'd actually prefer we didn't take barnes...
cdro225::I'd rather have Mkg but I'm a uk fan so i guess it's understandable.
sambai23::Wow...Toronto wins the battle of the tankers...They've destroyed the cavs all year regardless of health...That was an impressive loss....
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::With the players the Cavs were missing, you could definitely crow about it that way.
Novakaine Djokovic::<strong>lol epic fail from Bargs <a href="http://hoopsgrind.com/2012/03/25/lebron-james-vs-kevin-durant/ ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqGK2s6vW4</a> </strong>
i liked this comment::WTH?????????? CAVS WON?
cdro225::And without Kyrie or Parker.
spong3bobrox::i had the same reaction. and i was more shocked that it was on the road.
gri400::alright i'm outta here, later everybody. I imagine i'll see many of you tomorrow.  Go jays! ... and raps i guess
Giggity.iggity::Cavs lineup next year  C - Andre Drummond F- Tristan Thompson F- Alonzo Gee G - Lester Hudson G - Kyrie Irving  C - Anderson Varejao F - Omri Casspi F - Moe Harkless (draft) G - Manny Harris G - Donald Sloan (though I think we need a better backup PG)
tom7810883::Drummond is a scrub end of story
Alex818728::who Beal? I see him at 4 I think top 5 is Davis  MKG Robinson Beal barnes Drummond  but it is a lottery we might get 1
Giggity.iggity::The thing about Robinson is that he's a 3rd year player who was largely not very impressive in his first two seasons.  Beal is a freshman whose game is already very polished so his transition is seen as being easier.
Alex818728::Big are always risky at top of draft, beal is the safest choice
Giggity.iggity::Cavs won't get to draft that high.  He's projected top 3 no matter what.
Alex818728::I kinda agree, but we do need a big, and I think Sullinger will be worse
cdro225::I think MKG and beal will be the "locks" at our pick
cdro225::Drummond is another play I fear has bust written all over him.
Giggity.iggity::At worst, he'll be a more than serviceable center in the NBA due to his size and athleticism alone.  He'll be a project for sure, but I don't see the Cavs passing on him if he's there.  Andy has been hurt plenty and the Cavs lack of centers kills them every time he goes down.
gpacheco88::What the Hell Cavs!!!   winning at this point is not a WIN,     damn,  the  cavs  cant do anything right,
Alex818728::they cant get used to losing, its one game no matter what were gonna get a good player
spong3bobrox::Heat got blowed out by the Grizzlies at home! LMFAO!
nsmithNYC::Blowed is not the past tense of blow, not even a word really.
frazinat0r244::Blown* I guess
spong3bobrox::I knew some nerd was gonna try and correct me. Sorry, didnt realize this was school.Take your ass to a Knicks board.
cdro225::Callin right now. Heat won't make conference finals.
ZachRamsfelder::the heat doesnt have the mental aspect of the game. im happy im a cavs fan not a heat fan, because our team is going to be legit and really good in like two years (and because if i was a heat fan, i wouldnt exist)
spong3bobrox::FINALLY! hell.......
Alex818728::My Projeted Cavs lineup Next year  Fab melo (with lakers pick) Tristen Thompson Alonze gee (Resign him) Bradley Beal (with out pick) Kyrie irving  Bench Varajao ( I like him coming off bench prob is better then melo and TT but would be good as a 6th man) CJ Mccollum (take him with the 33rd pick backup pg out of Leigh) Omri Casspi William Buford ( take him with 34 and trade Gibson) Greg Oden or Hashem Thabbeet ( Both would be a gamble but we should roll the dice with one of them I prefer Oden) Luke walton (should not play  emailed this to Sam Amico and he agreed these would be great moves for cavs
Alex818728::lol
frazinat0r244::"How do u spell NBA?"   - Fab melo
ZachRamsfelder::"mee wazint allowd too play in tornamint cuz i culdint reed good"
Alex818728::year your probably right but I just liked him off the bench and he could lead the second squad, I mean i'd still play him at the end of the game
frazinat0r244::I know where you're coming from. Andy is solid though against #1's on other teams. He's a flopper, but a great player defensively.
ZachRamsfelder::lester hudson did work tonight. dont discount him as a bench player
cdro225::If we take melo I will cry.
cdro225::I watched a few cuse games this year. He is horrible. Backup center on a good team at best.
Alex818728::why he'll be the best Center on the board, doesnt score much but great defensivly not the brightest kid but will finally give the cavs a true center
frazinat0r244::You need to start Andy IMO. He was having a career season, it really depends if you want to win or rebuild for another year..
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::If the Raptors were trying to tank, they did spectacular since the Cavs were missing so many parts of the team.
gri400::i'll take that as a compliment lol, we did our best to make sure we had no PGs tonight
gri400::rated R for sure, somebody has to think of the children!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Oh, you could say this game was hardly "PG" can't we?
cdro225::Has it hit anyone else how freaking good the Cavs will be in two years.
cdro225::My bad I just saw the NYC in your name and assumed
nsmithNYC::Who the $@%!$ are the Knicks and what do they have to do with this thread?
nsmithNYC::Obviously you didn't click on my name to see who I was a fan of...
nsmithNYC::You obviously are an eternal optimist to make a statement like that after a game like this (coming off a nine game streak and beating a horrible team).
cdro225::About the way Knicks fans thought they would do with melo. How's that going for you?
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::What other choice do we have?
cdro225::I'm thinking 73-9 in the 2013-14 season
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I'll settle for 4-3 or better in the Finals.
frazinat0r244::LOL
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::SHHHHHHH! We're trying to keep it a secret!
CavsFan86::Good win Cavs!
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::OK i have to get some sleep, the Raptors are flying a jet in tomorrow at Port Columbus to pick me up. I have three straight day's of training camp. Flight is taking off at 6 am. So peace everybody!
frazinat0r244::lmao
gri400::look forward to our new star player
Giggity.iggity::Cavs need 2 more wins and I'll be happy.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::We're still behind them in the win column. Chill.
frazinat0r244::Haha. You better hope it stays that way, or else the tank is coming
cdro225::Ahhh every win decreases our chances at bOwing to the brow next season.
jbewlersdayoff::Congrats to the Raptors on doing a better tank job tonight. Hopefully we can catch you guys again before the season ends!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I'd like to say "Good Game, Toronto!" But I can't. We both kinda sucked tonight. But compliments on being some of the most civil fans on here.
gri400::hope for something like this for the MLB games over the weekend, cavs/raps games have been great board wise. Cavs fans are pretty cool here, nice and peaceful in all 4 games
gri400::it was a mess, pretty much from start to finish. I'm thankful i had a class for 8 innings in the middle, it got pretty bad
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I was going to be on, but my internet went out.
gri400::i'll be there, like this, polar bear BTW lol. Hope its nicer then yesterday, should be with it not being opening day and (god forbid) not being 16 innings, see you there
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I'll probably be on there myself, but with a Tribe screen name to be decided later.
SRStark20::Time for a three game streak against Toronto!  Let's hope the Tribe keeps it going tomorrow! I'm out.
Diamondslugz::As long as Pestano closes the game tomorrow.
jfuriate::About time we beat this Toronto team!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Ugh. Another close tough loss for the Caval ...what? We won?  AWESOME!
cdro225::The freaking raptors ruined our tanking. You all suck really bad.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Cav's win
Giggity.iggity::I'm really liking what I've seen from Lester Hudson.  Kind of short to be playing like a 2 as he's been doing, but his effort has been pretty good.
