Lynch::Good trade for the Cs. I don't really see both Crawford and Brooks as part of the Cs future.
jbdmusic::The Celts will have lots of options with all the picks. They can trade them, trade up in a good draft and they'll have lots of cap space because Humphries and Wallace will come off the books after this season. Who knows what Danny Ainge has planned. Rondo, Sullinger and Avery Bradley are probably the only who will be part of rebuilding.
Michael::Tank Commander Danny has made a bold move to acquire Joel Anthony.  His .06 rebounds per game almost equal those put up by Wallace.
David::It's time for a Toronto run, or they may be toast. Remember guys, you need good defense to get your offense started.
David::Toronto needs to concentrate more on its free throws. 40% is nowhere near an NBA standard. You are losing points through fouls.
Michael::Tank Commander Danny has made a bold move for the future.  Joel Anthony's .06 rebounds per game almost equals those of Wallace.
Rhinogold::Raps should take this, playing some consistent team ball the past 15 games or so.  Looks like even Kyle Lowry is happy.
John::Good move Tank Commander Danny Boy. Now for sure Celtics need to run and gun.
EIGHT::So the C's trade Crawford and Brooks for Joel Anthony and a conditional first round pick from the Philadelphia 76ers, which was in Miami’s possession.
PKM::Toronto probably wins this one.
