Commenter::Isaiah Thomas is winning an award this year. I dont know which one whether 6th man or most improved or whatever but he deserves something. Kid could Ball
trollificus::I hope this win costs the Kings a shot at Jabari Parker. And what the hell, they've already got Salmons...
andrew::Seriously Vazquez is a waste of time. Why even bother. I would rather start IT2 and have Jimmer come off the bench
daniel::If Thomas can keep on racking up assists, I back him.  He just needs to learn to pass consistently.
gdp::You'd think the racist coach would let the token get in for a mere second against Utah of all places. Yes. we know its the NBA, the "nuttin but african" league,  where the occasional European is allowed, but still. I mean I have to go to classes at work about "diversity" as put on by someone with a darker tan than me who says diversity is essential and then I see all these tan people on the floor (there's a coupe of teams with ALL dark tan people and no lesser tan people), and there were times it was ALL dark tan people tonight on the floor, tell me being diverse is the right thing to do .....then they don't do it.
trollificus::Cousins has added the flop to his skillset. Pretty awesome for him, sucks for Kanter.   I also expect this ref crew to be re-educated as to the fact that the league is SUPPOSED to be "cracking down on flopping".   Ah well, yoiu play Biedrins over the promising rook who hustles, needs the minutes AND CAN HIT FREE THROWS, you get what you deserve, right Ty? That's the ugliest kind of tanking.
Solar Jonny::Can we please take Salmons out now? He's useless!
Red M::ISAIAH THOMAS Should start and be given tons of PT... he's a a scoring machine
Wayward::Anybody have any idea what happened to DeMarcus Cousins? he's on my fantasy league team and he's only played about a minute?
Yeti on the Loose::DeMarcus on fire! Love it
