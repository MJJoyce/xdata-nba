riprope27::This was a great win for the Hawks. Really surprising the league this season. Lets hold out hope for CP# or D12 in the offseason
The_JTrain::looks like a little hang over after killing my team....  Why couldn't u freakin throw up 75 in that game... $@%!$@ bags
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::When your top performer is Nate Robinson with 9 pts, well you know the rest. ATL beat that as s with a bat last night.
This_Guy1::that's a 17 point difference. We kind of got destroyed.
LetsGoBraves2012::HAWKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Akat17::if this hawks team tonight would show up in the playoffs then they will make the eastern conference finals
Robert156877::Doubt it.  The Bulls you see in December w/o Rose and Hamilton and on a back to back road trip is not the same Bulls team you will see in May.
Chris341276::Ive have been following this betting system called sportsbettingstar. Ive made around 2-3K a month profits using this systems picks. I am making around 2-3K a month using this systems picks. I have bet on sports for years and have never seen a system work like this.
nathan ftwz::I have have?
elchupanibre8::...
NGarren0::unbeara--BULL!
Neil826::can you really blow out a team missing both starting guards playing.  and without the best player on either team on the court.  atlanta loses by 10 plus when the bulls play them with a full lineup.
Mini-Ditkas::Haha, scheduled loss.  Congrats Hawks, enjoy it.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::no such thing
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Plus Atlanta wasn't exactly at full strength themselves.
MrRelevant::I was at the game. Atlanta could've easily won by 25 or 30.
MrRelevant::hahahahahaa
2.3.1 Douple Play::Sorry Bulls fans but your team isn't going anywhere with Hinrich at point
mccoywajmu::Are you really wearing fubu?
ScalabrineSwag::K. Bc rose is coming back in a few months.
ScalabrineSwag::This board is dead...im off to the bears board :)
dwyaneFlashFinalsMVPwade::ouch 9 pts from your top performer? y'all need d-rose back
ScalabrineSwag::obviously but we are holding down the fort pretty well without him dont you think
ScalabrineSwag::Bulls didnt come out with energy tonight and shot extremely poorly...which is a recipe for defeat.
ScalabrineSwag::We have had a very tough stretch of games over the past week and will continue this tough stretch for awhile more. I am satisfied with how the bulls are playing right now.
badger67778::Well they have Houston and Indiana but then the Wizards and Bobcats should be two wins.
badger67778::Well I hope so. Parsons has been doing great too. Should be a good game.
ScalabrineSwag::i think deng/butler can stop him.
badger67778::Maybe so. Harden is always really tough though.
ScalabrineSwag::i think we can go 4-0 in this stretch. Houston isnt that good, we should be able to beat them
ctown8686::Bulls are Horrible lol, Trade Carlos Looser while you can Bulls fans!
badger67778::Rhode's scholar right here.
ScalabrineSwag::lol yes this dude aint too smart.
ScalabrineSwag::15-11 isnt horrible moron. And we cant trade boozer bc nobody wants his contract.
tbomber2::the fact that you say "trade" carlos boozer means you dont know what you're talking about
ScalabrineSwag::tbomber: What is your opinion on the PG position for the bulls? Who do you think should start?
ScalabrineSwag::it just drives me crazy seeing hinrich get burned over and over on d and nate robinson chucking up threes with no rebounders under the basket. LOL
tbomber2::kirk should start.  he may not put up numbers but he can run the offense and match up better on defense than anyone else.  nate is good energy and scoring sometimes off the bench, marquis is just too young and inexperienced to take on a starting role.   and when d-rose comes back, one of those 3 is gone, BUT it probably won't be marquis teague.
tbomber2::teague would develop well, but you could also kiss the playoffs goodbye with him starting.  he just hasnt had the time to learn thibs' offense (and esp. defense).
ScalabrineSwag::hinrich is too slow to guard a lot of the PGs in the league. Also, he turns the ball over quite a bit.   Personally, i wish that teague started. good development for a player that will be critical for future success.
ScalabrineSwag::Did deng play hurt tonight? (looking at the tweets)
tbomber2::yeah he tweaked his shoulder in the knicks game.  If i were to guess, just looking at the way he acted afterward, i think the shoulder popped out of his socket and back in (hurts like a $@%!$)
ScalabrineSwag::that would be awful for our team if he did. We would lose our main scoring threat. Deng NEEDS to stay healthy.
tbomber2::i think so.  ive had it happen before and it gets sore but you dont normally lose functionality.  if he tore something that could be a different story though
ScalabrineSwag::is he going to be ok. I remember that play but i thought it was just a stinger.
tbomber2::this guy was probably shouting LIN MVP last year and claiming that he was better than D-rose
ScalabrineSwag::Lin homers are stupider than lebron homers. Lin doesnt deserve to be in the same sentence as DROSE
ScalabrineSwag::Bulls 2 NYK 0  U mad knicks fans.
The_JTrain::yes
Knicks_Rule_0003::BULLS ARE GARBAGE.. AND YOU BULL FANS KNOW IT.  YOU JUST MAD.    19-7  BIITCHES.    SEE YA...  GO KNICKS.
PSHS_football::Yeah okay one playoff win the past 20 years gtfo bum.
ScalabrineSwag::2-0 against you guys :)
ScalabrineSwag::Lol Knick fans are so bitter that they lost to a roseless bulls.
Knicks_Rule_0003::Bulls are Garbage.. one win against a Flat Knicks team, and the bulls fans were in all their glory.    Dude, you lost to the SIXERS..  NUFF SAID.  BULLS ARE PRETENDERS..  KNICKS RULE
ScalabrineSwag::Without joakim and rose...you try beating the sixers without melo and jr smith.
tbomber2::two wins moron.  are you using no melo as an excuse and not counting one?  need i remind you we have been without derrick rose and rip hamilton?
ScalabrineSwag::just a bitter knicks fan...
tbomber2::the first game we beat you by 8 points.  a close game is normally not eight points.
Knicks_Rule_0003::HEY DICK HEAD.. BULLS WON TWICE.  THEY DIDN'T WHOOP THE KNICKS TWICE.  GET A $@%!$ CLUE IDIOT.  THE FIRST GAME WAS A CLOSE GAME.  NOT AN @%! WHOOPING.  NOW GO TO YOUR CORNER.
tbomber2::hey at least we whooped the knicks twice
Knicks_Rule_0003::THE IDIOT IS YOU .. HE SAID WHOOPED, NOT WON.  SO MIND YOUR BUSINESS BIITCH BOY
ScalabrineSwag::a win is a win is a win is a win.
tbomber2::speak less like a child and someone might take you seriously
Knicks_Rule_0003::once.  and so what, every broke clock is correct twice.
tbomber2::the bulls beat you twice, you idiot.
ScalabrineSwag::Trap game for the bulls. We will rebound on Christmas day.  BOOK IT
Boyanime::Lebron is Amazing, I've fallen in love with this man. as in a brotherly way
Knicks_Rule_0003::BULLS ARE GARBAGE.
HeatFan85::I guess ATL avenged the loss CHI handed your Knicks, huh?  smh
Knicks_Rule_0003::dude, We whooped your team, by 20 twice.
Boyanime::Oh Yeah. Merry Christmas to yall!!!
HeatFan85::Horford &gt;&gt; Noah
Boyanime::Happy Holidays!
Knicks_Rule_0003::lmaoooooo Bulls are GARBAGE...
ScalabrineSwag::we beat you guys. Twice
Boyanime::Merry Christmas!
flyingfalconsfan::Touchdown! Woooooo Hoooooooo!!!
ATLANTA BRAVES TOMAHAWK CHOP::Great win Hawks!
KidnLebronsCellycommerlShouldaWentWienerNmouthOverDaFro::knicks fans still trolling hahaha
i miss shots- lebrick::a day later and knicks fans are still mad
steven6623::actually im laughing at bulls fans
KillaKane24::Butt-hurt.
i miss shots- lebrick::why because another team did what your team couldn't
CARMELO4LIFE14::Knicks&gt;Bulls no way one game was without melo and the other game we had no big man other than chandler so stf u we will see you in january and own u with rose or without
CARMELO4LIFE14::Dude u realize it was tyson vs the buls frontcoart right
KillaKane24::I'm just having a hard time understanding why it matters so much for your team to be healthy when the Bulls have been playing without two starters for the majority of this season too. Your argument doesn't make any sense....
CARMELO4LIFE14::I will have  no excuse you guys beat us fair and square that is if were healthy
i miss shots- lebrick::melo still gave the knicks 29 points.. plus if noah didn't get kicked out and gibson wasn't injured the game wouldn't have been close
KillaKane24::Let's say...hypothetically speaking of course...that the Bulls destory the Knicks in January....with Melo.  What will your excuse be?
i miss shots- lebrick::david stern
CARMELO4LIFE14::and melo guarding boozer? please. we will see you in january
CARMELO4LIFE14::who cares bulls are still good without rose but if we dont have any backup center playing how u expect us to win?
steven6623::the knicks didnt come to play plain and simple.
i miss shots- lebrick::so what bulls were without rose and rip
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::or not
KillaKane24::You look at this team's record and some of the wins they have and you try not to be mad....especially with a downgraded bench and so many players hurt. But then you look at the way they have played in their last two losses and can't help but to be a little concerned.
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::what team?
Derrick Roses Skittles::Damn, Bulls! Figured they wouldn't win this tonight after being gassed from last game. Sometimes I hate back-to-backs.. not to PMS or anything, just sayin'
Derrick Roses Skittles::BTW Iggy.. this is Disliker
Derrick Roses Skittles::BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE - go to the heat board  k i'll be there soon
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::go to the heat board
steven6623::bulls do pretty well without rose he's overrated
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::they would be the 1st seed with him
steven6623::that would be what 4 more wins than they have now.
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::knicks suck, im out
Boyanime::That's how Miami stop Rose they always force him take a jump-shot
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::or they put a guy that appeared in 2 finals on a inexperienced kid
Boyanime::Unlike Chris Paul,  You see Rose can't shoot he has no jumpshot
KillaKane24::One also has an MVP while the other doesn't. But ultimately none of this matters.  Neither of them has a ring, so why are we even comparing?
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::Rose has the floater and has gotten a mid range pull up
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::"Rose will never be the same but Shumpert will" -knick fans
knicks_112ndcoming::im a knicks fan and i think Drose is the best PG in the league.  well.. was now
Boyanime::Rose is gonna be slower this time just like Chris Paul etc...
KillaKane24::I think CP3 has done well for himself either way....
Boyanime::Rose will never be the same player he once was
CARMELO4LIFE14::no way one game was without melo and the other game we had no big man other than chandler so $@%! we will see you in january and own u with rose or without
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::bulls with no rose&gt;&gt; Knicks
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::2-0
TomCreansPurpleDrank::Eh absolutely not.
Trae_The.Truth::Teague vs Teague lol
Boyanime::Deal with it Bulls Fans! After Rose comes back from his injury he'll never be the same!!!
Chris75448::That's what everyone said with AP and look now, we need to wait and see.
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::deal with it knick fans, your expectations are a 2nd playoff win
Boyanime::Deal with it Bulls fans, Rose will never bring a title to Chicago
BABY IGGY..GIVE MELO THE ROCK OR TWINKIE.YOUR CHOICE::deal with it knick fans, melo will only bring 1 playoff win to NY
