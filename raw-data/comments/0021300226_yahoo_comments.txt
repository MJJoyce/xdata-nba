Tony::Some nights Portland needs to hide the ball from Mo Williams. He is either really on or really off, no in between with this guy. Can't wait for McCollum to play. Coach better put him in the rotation and not ride him on the bench the whole season. He will be a consistent scorer and will be great alongside Lillard.
Oronde::I don't think that people realize how good this Blazer team is, they are a legitimate threat to the West.
chris j::I can't figure out why the Blazers have such a problem with Phoenix. It's crazy how some teams just have your number, even if it isn't necessarily a better team on paper.
Elan::Portland always has a tough time in Phoenix.  It doesn't matter who's on the floor for either team it is just a tough place to win. SA went down tonight.  Lets go Blazers!
Noggin::Nice run Portland!! 11 wins in a row is not too shabby.
fup duck::team fell behind so coach benched Lopez, and punted away his defense, and then everything went downhill.
Donald::The only thing I can say that the Suns took it into the Blazers in the second quarter after the Blazers had a first quarter lead   I don't know why the Blazers can not win in Phoenix.
Beachwalker::This Suns team is starting to remind me of the old Suns high powered offense of long ago.  Play just enough defense to make the offense go.  So far, I like what I see!
Kobe For 3.....Clank!::The Suns are a funny team.  They have played pretty good ball so far this season.
Django::Goran Dragic owns Lillard once again...
