Derrick Williams.........ROY::Conversations will continue on next Wolves board.. beep
Tyler81835::Nice Win Wolves!
Jg2.o::Ricky will be back better than ever next year. These types of surgeries are done at such a high level now. Hey, like many have said - look at the positives -- at least it happened now and not in 2 years when we could be at the top. Also, should give Lee and other guys a chance to prove themselves and grow as players and a team. Of course I want the Wolves to make the playoffs as much as anybody, but it's all about the larger picture. This will make them stronger.
Leap_JRH::That was a decent performance. I'm still bitter about Rubio. I'm still irritated with the "rah rah" nonsense from the homers. But, through all the adversity and negativity, it's always nice to get a win. Even though I know we aren't the same team without Rubio, we can still learn more about the players who will be on this team when Rubio is back... and maybe then, we can really bring on the meow.
steviebizzle::Tough loss, we needed this win to help us for a playoff push. We gotta get Utah now.
Leap_JRH::You'll run out of chances soon enough. The same probably goes for us as well. I like our chances a little more to qualify for a playoff spot, even without Rubio.
bushwild11::Kevin love after the game talking about the win http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWAKQCdGY3o&amp;feature=channel i hope the timberwolves can find a way to get in the playoffs
cfish4710::lmao, good interview.
thewolf1616::RICKY RICKY RICKY!!!!!
Dinomeyt::Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Kevin Love, Pau Gasol, and so many others send wishes to Rubio for speedy recovery. Kobe: nothing. Doesn't even apologize. I think we all know who the biggest d.o.u.c.h.e.b.a.g. is in the NBA. Lost all respect for u Kobe Bryant
Bill Lloyd::And Kobe was complaing about Wade supposidly breaking his nose and giving him a concussion. If he really had those injurys he would not have finished the All star game. ( then he ends Rubios year by putting his shoulder into him, and doesnt apoligize? Hes a joke
cfish4710::who cares, Kobe doesn't give two craps if Ricky Rubio went back to Spain and died. And why should he
eototal::How bout because Kobe is the reason Rubio got injured?
Dinomeyt::Its called good sportsmanship and respect for another good player. Slit ur wrist while ur typing why don't ya?
ibnfrey::Go Wolves! :)  Pek for president!
rayfinkle127::looks like Fargo came up big when it counted
MarkyMarc641::Can we PLEASE give Williams more than 21 minutes a game????   Jussayin.
mitchgort19::Looked like Gortat wanted nothing to do with Pek.
ACandOJ::What will Love's injury be when its time to play the Lakers this week??  For some reason he doesn't want to play them this year...and they're aren't that good
Dinomeyt::He'll b good for Utah (with 2 days off) and then we will have to wait and see vs. LAL. I would not be surprised if someone just goes street fighter on Kobe
ACandOJ::Possibly...but who knows.
Dinomeyt::Who knows. If we had Love in the last two Laker games, especially the game on Friday, we would have dominated the lakers
eototal::Derrick Williams + Kevin Love + Nikola Pekovic = Best Front Court in the game.
thewolf1616::Fo realz
nba is the worst::Threeparty in PHX!
PutYouOn::why do alot of people on the wolves boards have cat pictures..?? kind of corny
eototal::It's an inside joke. One person had a cat pic. They got made fun of and then a bunch of us started getting cat pics.
Solitary.Pine::B*tch.
log jamming::phoenix? playoffs? bahahahahaha!!!!!!!
AZWildcatOG::Derrick Williams!!
Slim_Greaser_310::see and you cats where doubting the twolves..
workman47::Wow what a defensive slugfest
eototal::/Holds up Sarcasm Sign
AZWildcatOG::Or was it bad offense?
PO10TiALNC0::Wolves fans.. What are you guys going to do with Beasley? Just give Williams his minutes and send him away for another scorer or rebounder
minny snowta::I like Beasley, he lit it up tonight in the short time he played.  He should stay and share the 3 with Williams, it's a nice combo!
eototal::Id love to do that but....KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN!!!!
T Dubbs::The Future of the frontcourt of Pek, Love, and Williams will be matched historically only by Bird, Mchale, and Parrish
PO10TiALNC0::Only 7 rebs for Love? ESPN is that a typo??
m4gor::well high shooting percentage =&gt; few rebound oportunities
Jaggerton::Both of which were the case tonight.
Jaggerton::He occasionally misses a double double, but usually when Pek is dominating underneath and/or all the shots are falling.
Jaggerton::Great win for the team... without Rubio the defense weakens but it also spreads the floor since everyone on our team can shoot.
DroppingKnowledge2012::1) LeBron James 2) Kevin Durant  1) Kevin Love 2) LaMarcus Aldridge 3) Blake Griffin  1) Chris Paul 2) Derrick Rose 3) Deron Williams 4) Russell Westbrook 5) Rajon Rondo   Basketball fans don't need me to give headings...
jiggy007::Adleman COY hands down.   Love MVP PEK Most Improved Ridnour 6th man
Jacob 014::im not saying he is the favorite... or should win it by any means.... i think popovic is the best coach in basketball and should be up there yet again... and i have disliked the spurs ever since  the kg/duncan rivalry... but to say that adelman as coty is stupid is just plain ignorant
DroppingKnowledge2012::Popovic is by far the best coach this season.  And by far the best coach this generation.   Popovic &gt; Phil Jackson (Mr. I-Win-With-Favorites)
Lebron23J23::clearly because they are your "new" favorite team, you havent watched them the past 2-3 years. Rick Adelman should win coach of the year, but only if the wolves make the playoffs
DroppingKnowledge2012::Hey LeBron, I've known about Kevin Love since his Junior year in High School...even saw a game live his Senior year.  The way it came together with Love, Rubio, Beasley, Pekovic, Darko, Ridnour just makes for an exciting team.   I don't believe in bandwagoning.  I'm a true basketball fan.  I've got no attachments, no homtown, personality bullsh*t.  I'm a true basketball fan.  I love all the best team and best players and don't mind watching any other team or player.  I know we're not on the same level of credibility but I just love basketball.
Jacob 014::i agree... but aside from rubio there is very little difference to the team.. and i respect rubio as a defender, but adelman obviously has a veteran presence that helps this team in the fourth quarter and a defensive philosophy much more effective... any time a team has surpassed last year's win total by the allstar break the coach has to be doing something right... i dont care how many new players he has
Jacob 014::i don't know how adelman for coty is "stupid".. he has improved the team defense by almost 10 points... but as a wolves fan i agree that the rest of the things are farfetched
DroppingKnowledge2012::Jacob.  To say "he" is the single reason for a difference in a defensive statistic is ridiculous.  Could it have to do with Loves, Pekovic, and even Darko's impact on protecting the basket.  Add to that that their offense is more effective (which helps out the defense) and athletism and rubio which has run the offense to this point.  You just have to understand that Coach of the Year is the Team Improvement award and it annoys me...sometimes it just makes sense that a team improves.  Coaches of the Year have lost their jobs the next year.  YES...there are great coaches...and I'm obsessed with it....but coach of the year hardly ever reflects the true coach of the year.
DroppingKnowledge2012::It's not coaching when its logical.  Kevin Love is the best PF in the NBA and improving every day and your confused why the T-Wolves are improving. You need to start TRULY recognizing how much of an impact on a game Love has on a game (beyond getting "MVP' on a team he piggy backs).   Besides...CLEARLY: Harden is the 6th man of the year.  I love the T-Wolves.  They are my favorite new team infact...but clearly you said stupid things just to sound cliche.  Those clearly aren't accurate.
DroppingKnowledge2012::Harden comes of the bench the same way Ginobili came off the bench all those years and THIS is a shortened year.  6ers have the best bench by far but Harden is significantly the favorite for 6th man of the year.  Want to write a 5 page paper but I'll just leave it at all the evidence this entire season...haha...
Jaggerton::the 6th man of the year is Lou Williams by a mile, right now.  Ridnour has started every single game, and even if he came off the bench he wouldn't be in that conversation.
eototal::How is Harden the 6th man when he starts?
KermitDaFrog18::poor josh childress...
CornhuskerKid02::I remember when some T'Wolves fans were ready to give up on Derrick Williams. The guy will be a stud
KingGeorge53::He's had a good week.
84Goldfinger007::Kobe complaining that Wade injured him .........?? Really?? Kobe just took out Rubio for the entire season!!
ACandOJ::But you won't...and when did Kobe complain.  It was the media doing all the complaining
eototal::I can't wait for the next time we play the Lakers. We should take Kobe out for the season.
scopatti::I love the highlight where Beasley gets a pass at the top of the 3-point line, takes 2 full slow steps forward without a dribble, and makes a shot.  I hope all the high school kids and future NBA refs were watching that one.  What a joke.
jiggy007::it was a dribble, stop, carry, dribble. step shot....
jiggy007::anywhere but here.... trade deadline...
miked_1::wher is he going
jiggy007::its his last game as a Wolf anyway who cares
timh651::Grant Hill is old enough to be your Grandfather!! http://www.wolveswag.com
Meet-The-Forkers::You keep saying this. We heard you the first time.
prezh601::This team will play better.. Rubio made some great passes but he also turned the ball over quite a bit and his defense is probably the worst in the league when it comes to point guard... His leverage was that he was staying healthy and on the court.. but that is all over know,.. Minnesota will be alright and will make the pplayoffs.. but point guard play runs the playoffs
Jacob 014::rubio has great positioning and is 3rd in steals... watch some games prezh
Mnsportsfanatic50::LOL what a dumass
schroer123413123::yeah this guys obviously not an expert
trevrro::I'm a bit confused because every great basketball mind has said Rubio is an above average defensive pg.
trevrro::I just realized we will never get to see rubio/love vs rondo/kg...
Dinomeyt::U know whos a good band: Soundgarden.
Mnsportsfanatic50::311 is better
84Goldfinger007::Black Hole Sun video is classic........
Dinomeyt::My favorite song out of them actually is fell on black days. Just shows Chris Cornell's singing abilities
84Goldfinger007::What chance do the Vikings have at getting Vincent Jackson??
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::They should trade for Dwight Howard
Dinomeyt::Same chance zach galifanakis has at banging Katy Perry or Adrianna Lima; zip to nada
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::same as them getting Manning
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Anyone like Young the Giant?
84Goldfinger007::How many different bands tried to imitate Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam??
Dinomeyt::I like Vedder because he's a baritone, finally songs that I could sing without having to strain my vocal chords
Dinomeyt::Creed, Nickelback, Theory of a Deadman
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Ugh! those bands are pathetic
Mnsportsfanatic50::Owlcity is the shiznit!
Jacob 014::i live 25 mins from owatonna and i hate that sh*t
XxLeprechaunxX::worst ever, id rather kill myself than listen to fireflies one more time
Mnsportsfanatic50::Listen to more then that song then not there only good song.
Mnsportsfanatic50::there amazing is what i mean!
Dinomeyt::I only like him due to the fact that he's from Owatonna. Sadly, thats it. His music is so bad
MNSPORTS93::lol my roommate blasts that sh/it constantly it's sooooooo horrible.
Dinomeyt::Minnesota born.
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::what do u mean by "shiznit"?
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Dubstep is garbage
eototal::Skrillex FTW!
Jacob 014::haha dinomeyt... i normally respect your posts... but rock music is all about some annoying screw society campaign... country songs are just chill to listen to
Mnsportsfanatic50::And what are any other 3 themes? rock, hip hop, rap, alternative, answer that?
Mnsportsfanatic50::Thats true ill give ya that. i listen to anything that connects to me so im not bias on any music is why i questioned that.
Dinomeyt::Rock has themes that are hard to find, they are abstract, until they spill the beans in Rolling Stone
Dinomeyt::Country might be the worst. The themes never change. Its always 1) Love and relationships 2) Beer 3) doing ur livestock (or ur wife, whatever u call them)
badgerfan288::Don't forget pickup trucks...
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::and hip-hop
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::so is country
XxLeprechaunxX::on a roll here
dlhouse18::yep
XxLeprechaunxX::thank you
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Indie Rock aka good music
dlhouse18::had to make one last comment on this. indie sucks worse than pop. The whiny voices of pop are terrible though. Jessie J isn't as bad as Perry and Gaga. Pop can be okay if you have a decent vocalist bc it revolves around that.
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::How do you like that $@%!?
Dinomeyt::I would do Jessie J in any video but "Do It like a Dude" scary as all hell!
MNSPORTS93::lolziez. Indie rock is the worst garbage known to man, besides pop.
MNSPORTS93::that's next on the list haha.
Dinomeyt::Gotta do that with Dark Side of the Moon. It is an unforgettable experience. Seriously, listen to the first song and be amazed
MNSPORTS93::The wall, on vinyl, straight through. incredible.
Dinomeyt::I've done that three times: Breathe and Us and Them from Dark Side of the Moon and Comfortably Numb from the Wall. Best experience EVER
Dinomeyt::Its kind of like grateful dead and LSD. U need have one to make the other amazing. Never tried it, don't plan to. I did listen to comfortably numb after smoking k.u.s.h. best good feeling experience ever
MNSPORTS93::yeah anything is good with the gonj.  Pink Floyd is the best for that, IMO.
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::depends on what indie too. There's a lot of different types of indie
Dinomeyt::Pop is so much worse than indie. Indie is great if u smoked some green stuff, kind of like reggae. U need certain materials to make it sound awesome
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::more substance and complexity in my opinion.
dlhouse18::lol at Dinomeyt  looks like we both like metal at least? Half of stuff I listen to is death metal though. Hurt and Chevelle are about as soft as it gets for me.
Dinomeyt::I am primarily disturbed. Believe is an underrated album. David Draiman has an amazing voice for a metal singer
dlhouse18::never liked his voice much. I like melodic stuff though maybe that's why. i g2g tho.
Dinomeyt::Hottest female rockstar. In my opinion the lead singer from Lacuna Coil......I would do her like there was no tomorrow
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Marilyn Manson
Dinomeyt::Female, not alien
Mnsportsfanatic50::As dave chapelle would like to say " GAME BLOUSES "
dlhouse18::Most underrated band: Hurt love their stuff even if it's not mainstream.
84Goldfinger007::Old School or The Hangover???
Dinomeyt::Old school was so good. I like the hangover, but old school, I felt like I was dying from laughing so hard
XxLeprechaunxX::Old School definitely, Hangover is overrated
dlhouse18::K Love's beard&gt;Harden's beard&gt;Wilson's beard
dlhouse18::I didn't really care about deciding between the two. The main point is that Love has a better one than both.
paul34135::lol
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Harden over Wilson?
dlhouse18::Puppies don't play till Thurs. That sucks.
84Goldfinger007::Worst bands........I'll start off.....Nickelback...........
freaky69az::Mastodon - unlistenable sh.it
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Phoenix
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Montreal
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::The Postal Service
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Death Cab for Cutie
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::MGMT
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Passion Pit
MNSPORTS93::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ-KxVjDGGc
dlhouse18::Disturbed
Dinomeyt::Again, I don't feel bad for rickrolling u, thats like 1/4 of my ipod. Best workout/weightlifting music
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::The Antlers
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::LCD Soundsystem
MNSPORTS93::LMFAO
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Youth Lagoon
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::I actually like them
Dinomeyt::oh god, that band might be worse than nickelback
dlhouse18::Avenged Sevenfold
MNSPORTS93::Check out their first 2 albums. way heavier than the hard rock junk they do now.
dlhouse18::I hate them. Too soft for me. Liked Bat Country but really nothing else.
Dinomeyt::Screw u now I dont feel bad for rick rolling u
MNSPORTS93::their old stuff got me into metal, so i gotta disagree with you on that one,
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Hot Chelle Rae
minny snowta::Creed
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::amen brotha!
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::I totally forgot about Daughtry!
Dinomeyt::Hooray!! three people with common sense
Dinomeyt::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-My1FlTW9-Y Enjoy Call of duty supernoobs. Best part 3:40
XxLeprechaunxX::lol, but i will no longer click on your links
XxLeprechaunxX::it was rather funny though
Dinomeyt::I got u again??? yes!!!!
PhilMNAP::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG6bel-SKhc&amp;feature=related  This is what we are missing.
paul34135::yep
