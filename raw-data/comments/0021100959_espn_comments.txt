Kev_010::Wolves are comming for you Clippers so better be ready next year!!!
mathw01::Why don't they worry about coming for the Suns or Rockets..
mathw01::CP3 proves yet again why he is the best guard playing in the city of L.A.
ustna::best in the league....
colt domination::lot of competition
kaboomthebeaver::Griffin, Howard and Humpries have moved Lebron down to 4th place on the most hated list in the NBA.
Soonerhopeful1::What is all this  " Hate Cr@&gt;  P  "    I've got a different  perspective....    Kindergarten children posters..!   that's what we have here...!   Children pouting from disappointing  games and  their   toys.
mathw01::Guess you didn't see World Peace yesterday..Nice take..
iSeeTheHateInYoEyes::Just watched some of Blake's "hard fouls" and they arent "hard" at all. I see lots of acting and flopping by Blake.
Soonerhopeful1::May I suggest an eye examination..!  or change from " rose colored glasses".
gr8st23::Good for yooooou! Good for yooooou!
mathw01::You sound like an authority of what "hard" is...Good for you.

USISBEST::Please. English only?
Johnson95135::Lol Clips really had to "rally" at home against NO with playoff seeding on the line?  What a team!

Fluke760::There used to be a reason to care about what Monty Williams had to say...then they traded it.
jlive1996::Didn't hear anyone say anything about CP3's 8 steals...come on now that's big...Clippers in the finals...no one, I mean no one is gonna be able to stop chris paul in that pik n roll...he was dangerous in new orleans with no help...lets all take time to think about that!
James84231::No one except his knees.

texasrangersin12::I’ve been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over $3,000 a month for three months straight now following this system. I found this system by Google searching the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for anyone out there that is looking for a system that actually works and is tired of not winning your bets like I once was
sslevanderbilt::people who complain about flops annoy me. There are people players on every team that flop. It's not like Clippers are the only players that do it.
Shoot My Horse::If you got all the flops from the other 29 teams, multiplied them by 2, it still wouldn't be more than the amount the Clippers have flopped.

SoCalMtnGuy::The Lakers are guaranteed home court in the first round already. One more Clipper loss (@ATL and @NYK) or if the Lakers beat the cowtowners in Sac, they get the third seed and Pacific Division. The Clippers must win one of their remaining two games to secure the fourth seed and home court for the first round or hope Memphis loses one if its final two games at home (Cleveland and Orlando).
Fluke760::So you're saying all the Lakers have to do is have a bad night, without Ron Artest, in a trap game, in Sacramento and the Clippers can swoop their spot? Sounds pretty guaranteed to me, yep...
candycandyYOU::wow RON artest should ELBOW blake griffin...flow  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxlSgPmpefg
Oakpooh::I would hate on Clippers fans but I'm not sure that they exist. Go Lakers!
