A1R::I had high hopes on Brian Shaw being a good head coach and I still think he can be but damn he's doing a terrible job with the Nuggets. Maybe he is overrated and better fitted to coach the triangle offense with the Lakers. Just look at his rotations and the inconsistent minutes he gives some of his players. Andre Miller is a 15 yr vet and 1 of the most underrated point guards in NBA history. He's only missed less than 8 games in his career. You don't bench a player like Dre and expect to win. On top of that, he was benched for Nate! Wherever he is, George Karl is laughing at the Nuggets and saying, "I told you so!".
Charlie Mac::Why is Faried getting less minutes?
PKM::Denver is not going to make the playoffs.
Curtis Harris::If your not going to play Nate Robinson , then trade Nate back to the Bull's for a draft pick or money
AnthonyM::This Denver team is pretty bad.
Johnny::why is Foye starting? He can't defend, shoot, or pass...Shaw must really like him as a person.
AnthonyM::Giving up 44pts in the 2nd Q....wow. The coach needs to go.
HBS::Smart move to say that they were beaten by "bad teams." The sixers will be great w/Moultrie, Noels, two draft picks and maybe some money. At that point, some of them will remember.
Prentis P::Wow i have a friend thats a nugget fan.. And he laughs at the spurs when they loose a game while his team is getting beat by everyone on a nightly basis lol..
Teams stink::I see that these 2 pathetic teams have zero defense!  Way to lose AT HOME, too, Denver! This team should be playing high school teams.
