kgdkdsk jgrjfgjd;fl::Durant is the best offensive player on the planet. He should not have to dish out 8 assists with only 1 turnover for OKC to win. Russell WestBRICK's typical line assists to TO's 5 to 3 will not cut it against a high quality team in a seven game series. They can't slip up one time at home in a series. They must gain home court advantage in every series they play in order for them to have a chance to win. I just don't see it with this roster. WestBRICK chased Kevin Martin away. He was a valuable piece to their pie.
Homer Fudd Jr.::So who do the NO-DEFENSE flop city Clippers play next? Hopefully Utah. So they can get a win!
Kingex::I hope JJ could would only score 5 pts. That's for the long time spent on the bench last game against the wolves, though he started the game very well. Let's see if these Clippers' superstars can handle it by themselves. Hate to see a team benching a player which has started the game in good rhythm. (expletive) the system that prioritizes superstars!
KEITH::Doc ran from celts because he might have to start coaching, went 2 the clips team loaded with talent. Showing what he is in L A, OVERRATED.
Tuan::Clippers need Barnes to take one for the team again by taking Ibaka out of the game.
BendGod::I'll be watching the Saints victory over Atlanta tonight.  But thought I'd see what was up. I'm assuming OKC is the favorite? I think they win it. Watch Thunder Roll
Divorced Miss Magoo::Has anyone seen my ex-husband?  I thought for sure that bandwagon fan would be a Clipper.
Kobe For 3.....Clank!::The future of basketball plays tonight.
Homey D Clown::Wow what a close game.
Homey D Clown::Quality team vs. mediocre team is really showing tonight.
