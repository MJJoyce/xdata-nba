Toomersforever::glad we won this game. I hate it when we lose to crap .500 teams. . .  Now we need to focus for PHILLY - they are more than just a BS media sensation. Go Hawks
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::The funny thing is, Knicks fans actually think that the Knicks are so much better than they really are and should wipe the floor with a legit proven playoff calibur team that has been there and done that for around 5 or 6 years running(Hawks).  I just point and laugh at the ones here in Atlanta. Oh well, you just have to marvel at them.
_slickSixtySix_::u misspelled caliber
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::I'm not perfect nor is anyone that I have had the pleasure to come across on this site. What are you going to do??
stone419::well to be fair, the knicks did wipe the floor with them last time they played
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Right but the difference is over the last 5 years or so the Hawks have evidently been the better team and that's just a fact. Nothing has really changed so much to really think differently.
stone419::last night was a one game sample size also
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::1 game sample size and time and circumstances lead to different results that NORMALLY would not happen. There is your answer. :-)
888nbafan::What's up with Lin?  A sore knee can be played through.  What's up with all the mystery?  Screw it, let's just grab him and shove him in a MRI.  Who's with me?
mizer35752::how many times did BD get swatted? no ups. it's so clear he's playing through pain. knicks are really banged up.
kethesnyper::Why are people blaming the loss on Melo, Melo and Shumpert were the only guys who actually showed up
mizer35752::to melo's credit, he played his heart out last night. people look at the stat line and think all he did was hog the ball. the rest of the team looked dead tired. no legs at all. melo looked wiped out in the 4th. knicks need to get healthier. stat is done for the year, but we need lin and jeffries back.
Jamaal 43::Landry Fields +2 Melo -7 ( that's why that stat is meaningless !!!) BS
Jamaal 43::I blame injuries for last nights lost
myaulin::I blame Lin for this loss..if he played Knicks would have won
RyanCarranza::And Milwaukee won?  Oh mannnn...
Road dog Red::Lin better hurry back...Baron Davis moves in suoer slo mo
NewcastleFanVL::Sounds like ur a fan of both knicks &amp; celtics , kinda strange...
Road dog Red::NY....WTF...lose to ATL...such a letdown
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Atlanta has a better record than both the Knicks and Boston, so I'm thinking the let down would be the other way around. I'm just saying though.
ATLJoe22::Sounds like Willie Green went beast mode on JR Smith last night. I didn't get to see the game but dam Willie, 20 off the bench? I'll take that
I have popcorn in my ears::J.R. is a mini-Melo.  Just wants to shoot and get his stats up.
Jamaal 43::BS
NewcastleFanVL::Shumpert's hustling play reminds me of Latrell  Spreewell. Spree left every drop of his sweat on the court every game, kudos to both !
Kimsky1::I miss Spree, even if he was crazy.  In fact, maybe BECAUSE he was crazy. At least you know he gave a rip.
i-am-you-i-am-all::i am all
nicks4691::I'm Lin fan. Not because he is a great pg, but because of his story and good enough plays. He needs to improve quickly to keep the Linsanity going.
Kimsky1::I'm a Lin fan because I think he contributes to the team.
Thetimpanikid16::like I sad after the game against Orlando. Carmelo could score 40 points but the Knicks would still lose. Only 2 guys scored in double figures and no one came even close after that. The game against Orlando saw basically 6 guys in double figures. Melo has to distribute the ball more and score less. He's selfish. There's no denying it. There's no reason why he should be taking 24 shots and Steve Novak only 3. That's why the Knicks will lose in the playoffs because I don't see him up to the task. It's not about scoring, it's about being a leader and having a better all around game. He should be thrilled that he's only scoring 15-20 points a game while seeing Smith, Novak, Shump, Chandler and Baron getting a up around 10-15 points. Lin will bring that back when he's healthy but Baron can't be relied on and Bibby just sucks lol
pk9394::you a fool if you think Melo isn't the problem, well maybe part of the problem.  Their offense strategy is setup mainly pass the ball to him and let him score, you know what that will happen when the focus is on one player alone, everyone else will not move and just stand there to watch his solo play and you can argue alll you want that he have assist too.  Just picture yourself in a basketball game and everyone is expecting the single person to shoot and suddenly he have no shot and pass out the ball to you at the final moment.  You will not going to do much with that ball. Yes there are great player that have isolation play which draw 2-3 defenders and create open shot for the other but Melo is not one of them.
NewcastleFanVL::Splendid comment !
Kimsky1::Can't blame this loss on Melo. If he's gonna shoot 11 for 24 I'm good with it especially if he's 13 for 14 from the line.  11 missed foul shots as a team, Davis goes 2 for 8 Smith goes 2 for 10,  That's why we lost.
Thetimpanikid16::granted JR Smith was 2-10 last night.... Shumpert looks great. He should start instead of Fields. Probably would help Fields' game a lot coming off the bench. Less pressure, I suppose.
Blueguyz::helo guys.. anyone here know when will jeremy  and amare play again?
Blueguyz::thanks for those info guys..
x5bewarehunter2x::jin will back next week, but amare will be out 2-4 weeks
NewcastleFanVL::Lin coming tuesday, stats post season.
nicks4691::Lin later next week. STAT next year.
mark35345::Any team with Baron Davis in the rotation won't be ready once the speed is turned up (playoffs).
Thetimpanikid16::No, that's not why the Knicks will be unsuccessful in the playoffs...
Thetimpanikid16::the larger problem is above lol
mark35345::There's a litany of reasons yes - this is but a microcosm of a larger problem.
jaaawf::get the idea Carmelo?  Scoring alone can't win...play the defense or end career never having won a thing.
iNSlGHT::melo wasnt the reason we lost........
josher1223::Every other starter except one shoots a higher percentage than mello... Yet Mello takes more shots than everyone and they lose. Then he throws a lazy pass to give the game away. They lose to the Hawks! Playoffs? The real teams that play team ball will wipe the floor with the knicks.
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::Melo did that for long... Melo made Knicks look like Harlem...
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::Yo guys prepare for the playoffs. I prepare for the All-Star game next year..  -- Melo Da Top-Shooter
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::Woodson needs to keep his defense at high level as usual and find the the two other consistent scorers in addition to Melo.
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::Next game will be a real test for Woodson/Melo.
DrueLife::Knicks fans:  Mike Woodson is the worst match up coach in the NBA   noticed how he checked Josh and Joe last night, pitiful.
DrueLife::Joe Johnson is the coolest player in the L his pull up is too smooth
_MKE_::Bucks &gt; Knicks
Plucky Purcell::The Melometer is inching towards ego-red. Somebody's gotta step in and be a leader, because Melo's not good at inspiring other guys or elevating team play.
c.beck28::knicks stink and if they cant get to the 6 seed they will be 1 and done
Kimsky1::I don't think they stink but you are right about the 6th seed. They won't be able to beat Chicago or Miami in the first round.
EliMeloCuse::Knicks fans don't deserve to have a basketball team. Really complaining about Melo and Woodson when the teams on an 8-2 run? You want D'Antoni back? Isn't it pretty clear his stubbornness to adapt his system at all to his players was the problem? I swear New Yorkers didn't watch basketball the past 10 years and now they act like they know how the NBA works.
Fattyarbuckle1313::Wow poor knicks rollercoaster continues. They have had like 6 seasons rolled into one! At times they have looked like a legitimate threat to the heat in the east and then within a week can look like a non-contender. This week brings a serious injury to Amare and the Bucks are like the hottest team in the league and may take the 8 from NY. Knicks need to stay positive. They finally have the talent, they just need health. They even found a coach who stresses D. If things fizzle out for NY this year, you knick fans can go into next year knowing that if u stay healthy, the sky us the limit (or Wade and LBJ!! LOL :-)
I have popcorn in my ears::LMAO  Most hilarious post of the morning!
TYLILMAX::knicks played a good game  fields could not guard jo johnson at all.
Plucky Purcell::They didn't really play a good game. The Hawks played pretty well.
NewcastleFanVL::Personal glory, team misery, heroball sucks ! In all the NY wins during Lin era, melo never scored over 30, they were all TEAM wins ! I hope Woodson buys this &amp; knows what to do next.
YourAirballnessKobeSteak::Woodson does not believe that at all. He relies on Melo 100% now.
babebombers::Linsanity's brother is a student at my sister's college and they are friends!
Fattyarbuckle1313::That's sounds queer
bchalcyon89::Regular Knicks fans are asking, where are the asians? just a lot of empty seats.
P4P Pacman::They are watching Stephon Marbury dominate the Chinese Basketball Finals!! lol
TYLILMAX::can you do it?
ny445::knickerbockers looked sluggish tonight tomorrow nights a must win lets get it boys
62jr62::Chandler had a really bad game. It really showed towards the end with those missed shots and not hustling back down the court on dee.
sleepyhnl::One of the NY papers quoted Chandler saying he pulled his groin muscle.
Fattyarbuckle1313::He should stop tugging it :)
62jr62::He did look frustrated, but there were also some bad calls made against him.
ny445::i dont agree with this hole melo isnt a team player hes busting his $@% 5 steals tonight had at least 36 points hes a great player and has proved over this 8-2 record over the past few weeks he can ball and is most deff a team player
big_east27::when you pass the ball and people don't knock down shots, can't blame him...
_slickSixtySix_::yeah... it's def better than before when he was only doing offense... i'll take it
ny445::thats just me thinking im no sports anaylist but for me if you can score and play hard d all night you contributed to the team in big ways hence making you a team player
ny445::i see your point assists honestly dosent matter if hes playing hard d all night shows he isnt focused on just outscoring everyone on his team
_slickSixtySix_::how many assists then if he is a team player?
_slickSixtySix_::that or too much melo iso?
RaidersCelticsRedsox::lin has talent but got schooled by rondo when rondo posted the monster triple double....point is...lin turns the ball over too much but he can score against weak pg's.....but with the knicks they have monster talent if they had a rondo type player who just dishes all day with swag like he does the knicks would be atop the eastern conference ....fact.
Fattyarbuckle1313::Well if the Heat had Rondo, they would easily be #1- fact. They are only  a couple games back with no PG or center for that matter. Knicks would not be better than heat or bulls with Rondo, and possibly not even better than o-town
Machine from future::Lin's turnovers are average for a PG position, meaning 4 to 6 per game (just look at the TO stat for any PG of your choice after a game was played).  If you are expecting perfection, that's different.
P4P Pacman::Yes Lin is prone to turnovers. Did you see the Knicks game last night?? Baron Davis had numerous turnovers only in the 1st QUARTER!! Both Knicks guards gets sloppy with the ball at times.
RaidersCelticsRedsox::celtics what????still old? not a threat to y'all? be honest.......
Fattyarbuckle1313::Celtics run with the guys they have is clearly over. Even they know that even if their fans don't. That's why he almost traded Rondo. That god he didn't because they can rebuild around him. Celts knew this day would come but it was worth it. They had a great run dude
_slickSixtySix_::was garnett dropped at birth?
bchalcyon89::2-4-23-38-46, Mega Ball 23
oldirtyzoo::injuries will plague the knicks...they need sum prayers
oldirtyzoo::injuries will plague the knicks...they need sum prayers
dawgzNkatz::Can LIN thrive under MELO-centric offensive system? What about other role players like Chandler, Novak?
Fattyarbuckle1313::It's funny, in one years time, knick fans went from seeing melo as their savior and ticket to championships. And now he is spreading a plague over NYC, if u listen to the fans. Talk about heat having bandwagon fans, this is ridicilous
_slickSixtySix_::no one can survive melo
ny445::out
newyorksportsfan100454::I'm still waiting for this big plan Knicks success product 4 years ago that both owner James Dolan and GM Donnie Walsh promised. What happened back in 2008 to Lebron James supposed to be coming to the Knicks by 2010?
_slickSixtySix_::knicks are doomed
bchalcyon89::I dont think i've seen Shumpert this peppy in the last 20 games he played.
oldirtyzoo::he played a long game, did look kinda tired in the 3 &amp; 4th quarter. he's gonna shine

dawgzNkatz::If the Knicks lose against the Cav's, the Fans at the Garden will chanting for Woodys Head
oldirtyzoo::Imagine Patrick Ewing actually becoming coach....scary to think about fans in MSG
newyorksportsfan100454::More like for owner James Dolan's head. After the Raptors fiasco blow out of the Knicks last week that is what I was thinking of.
oldirtyzoo::Lin will NOT be a Knick next season. Knicks need a PG!
Miyon34::BD~
PJ Villa::shumpert is playing PG.just like woodson wants
PJ Villa::shumpert is playing PG.just like woodson wants
dawgzNkatz::The knicks need a pg right now that lin is injured.
catplayball2::Heard Nash may join Heat.  What is your thought?
KevinBryant1987::Nash needs to retire As a suns. I can't picture him in Miami..
PJ Villa::he deserves a ring.that won't happen in phoenix
oldirtyzoo::lmao!
_History_Buff___::I think Lin's people bombed Pearl Harbor.
Skatingseveneleven::I think lin is an American citizen... how can American bombed its own city ..  scaried !
bchalcyon89::I think Billions of american taxpayers money is wasted on education. You make the perrrfect example.
bchalcyon89::He's old. Miami is just for the limelight.
