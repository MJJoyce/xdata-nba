Nathan Towns::People just don't realize how good the Morris Twins are. RCJH
Frank Cyrus Dionisio Gabriel::oladipo shud be on the d league// kids sux
Tom Totosz::Keep shooting oladipo. You'll eventually hit one. He's awful. He hasn't taken one normal shot today. How he stays in the game is beyond me. Just goes to show you how terrible this league has become.
Frank Cyrus Dionisio Gabriel::his bad.. vuc is open all the time nd he keeps hogging it .. this magic team is so bad.. they play garbage one on one ball.. down by 6 and got a 2on 1 break and pulls up for a three .. bunch of retards .. i dont kno why der -1.5 is beyond me
Brandon Duenas::http://isportsweb.com/2013/11/21/phoenix-suns-looking-establish-identity/  Check out this article I wrote up! I'll be doing two a week and include some trade rumors and talk about the draft in my next piece. Hope you enjoy, Go SUNS!
Randy Dixon::The magic are complete garbage....worst team in the league by far...oladipo couldn't make the d league all star game as a point guard
Eddie Cruz::Looks like we might trade Dragic to Chicago for that Charlotte pick that they own this year. Seems logical at this point.
James Incredible-Jackson::Wait am I missing something? Is AFFLALO the best active SG in the league right now?!
Frank Cyrus Dionisio Gabriel::trey burke and oladipo are both awful point guards.. smh
Brandon Tigues::danny green been teaching gerald how to shoot 3's?
