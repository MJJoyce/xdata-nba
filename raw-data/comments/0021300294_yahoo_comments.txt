heinzy k::I really REALLY HOPE the Heat can fix that front court.  I just don't trust CB as the starting Center ... it is pathetic.  The Heat better know what they are doing with Greg Oden
Godzillaman999::Ah, It's been a problem since we've lost Wade, due to a bad knee. Our adjustments are needed, indeed. We will put our players to the test against the Timber Wolves, which should be successful. At least I hope so. (And yes, I am a loyal Miami Heat fan. All these teams you see on my picture, shows my spot of favorites forever.)
Ronnie::Go Miami Heat!
sda::Keep Beasley and dump Bosh at the end of this year, should save some money to pickup a bigman who can actually rebound more than 3 a game. Bosh is terrible. Worst 6'11 rebounder i have ever seen, he flails around like a goldfish out there, only thing he can do is hit outside jumpers, but he has to be wide open. Can't do anything else, literally.
Dr. Dinglebutt::Watch Minnesota expose Miami for the overrated bums they are!
Dennis::Well done ricky rubio, 6 assist , 6 turnover and 1 point. Don't understand what's all the hype about this kid except all the flashy passes.
fcbonilla::Heat have to improve on those turn overs.
PKM::Wade is back from vacation
Shaft::"Well the heat are in trouble. the pacers and blazers are playing too good and would crush the heat in a seven game series. if the heat don't make some changes, they're going to be disappointed this summer. Back to you, Frank."
Random Guy::Trade Bosh for Asik and Parsons. a win -win fro both teams.
