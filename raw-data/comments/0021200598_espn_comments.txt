7BAUGHLLIN7::Derrick Favors and G-time are both, id say equally as talented at their respective positions.. G is gonna bring a ring to slc
ensign.devyn::As long as he doesn't make those stupid mistakes, he plays great. His shots looking to be staying pretty consistent, he's getting better at creating his own shot, he plays the best D on the team, gets those chase down blocks, makes good passes... He's developing almost perfectly.
Booty Loaf::i bet these $@%!$@% were saying the same thing about OKC/seattle a few years back
Darkflame07::The cavs don't have Durant, Harden Westbrook and Ibaka. Nobody can compare their rebuilding team to OKC because none of them have 4 players of that caliber. Irving is legit, waiters looked good but he isn't Harden and they have nobody the caliber of Durant.
Booty Loaf::kevin durant won 43 games his first two year in the league
ensign.devyn::Whatever makes you feel better.
Booty Loaf::oh lord. readin the $@%!$@%! comments utah fans are making.. just oblivious to everything
ensign.devyn::Such as Cleveland being 2nd worst, 3rd worst, and 2nd worst these last 3 seasons? But somehow they are going to be competing for the Finals in a couple years? While Cleveland fans dog on the Jazz for being mediocre because they're consistently in the playoffs? Mmmmmkay.
go cavs275::Im done with this, I type too slow for all the things I have to say.  I think the next thing to add on these comment boards is to "add voice" .  I wonder if/when they'll do that because I would like that alot better and I'm sure other people would too.
ensign.devyn::I would hate that for games such as this. All we would have heard from Cleveland fans is the sound of whining ;)
ensign.devyn::It seems that halfway through every season for every sports team in Cleveland, the fans are already looking to next year.
go cavs275::No, this year most fans knew the cavs were going to bad this year, because we are VERY inexperienced.
Is That All You Know::No one wanted to play with James. In Cleveland or anywhere else basketball isn't the only thing in play for big names. Endorsements play A. Major part in this..
scow79::It is amazing that the best Cleveland could do was put Mo Williams next to LeBron.    You'd think more players would flock to play with LeBron.  Maybe it was a cap issue or something?   I have no idea.   Maybe go cavs can explain it.   And I'm not trying to be a troll here.   I'm just not familiar enough with the Cavs past.
ensign.devyn::And what was the excuse last year? What about the year before that? Even when Lebron was there, the organization couldn't get good pieces around him. For hell's sakes, they went out and got Antawn Jamison of all players. They got lucky having Lebron for the years he was there, but they have no idea how to build a team or pick up the right pieces.
ensign.devyn::All right, I'm sorry for busting Cleveland's hump. They do have some good young players. With a couple more lottery picks and a better coach, they can probably be the 10th or 11th seed in the East in, say, 3 years.
Darkflame07::Yeah because he accomplished so much in NO with Chris Paul.......
scow79::I'd take Byron Scott over Corbin anyday.
mikeisildur::No, it takes Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol, and Steve Nash to achieve a lofty perch in the top 11 in a conference.
scow79::The Jazz did not have the chance to draft Klay Thompson.   He went to GS with the 11th pick and the Jazz took Burks with the 12th pick.
go cavs275::Honestly, if you think that in 3 years the Jazz will be better than the Cavs then you're delirious.
assistmaster801::True... Ummm haven't you read any sports analysis Jazz are prone to be a top 4 team in the near future.. Sorry Cleveland fans but Kyrie can only do so much!! It's called needing a bench as well. Look at the lakers! They suck who's to say Kyrie is going to stay! Since Lebron did!!! Bigger and better things than Ohio!!
Frank24875::its impossible to get a clutch shot of in the post when teams are playing playoff defense
ensign.devyn::Apparently you haven't watched Al Jefferson much.
go cavs275::Yeah oops I forgot that the Jazz have 2 future super stars.
scow79::Actually Jefferson's numbers in the clutch are surprisingly good.
ensign.devyn::That's why we have Al Jefferson? But like I said, I'm sure plenty of organizations would love to be pointless like the Jazz and make the playoffs most every year.
go cavs275::Not worth arguing, scows right it is pointless, just like sitting at the 8th seed and never getting out of the first round.  Small market teams have to be REALLY bad for a few years before they can contend for championships, it's just how it is.  The Jazz need a player who can take over a game and win it in the final minutes.
ensign.devyn::You can't tell me that they won't, cause guess what? We both don't know. Yeah, you've had that the last 2 years. Meanwhile, the good organizations have been making the playoffs.
go cavs275::You can't tell me you think that Kanter, Burks, Favors, and MIlsap is going to be better than Kyrie, Dion, TT, Varejao.  Plus we're going to have a very high draft pick to add again this year.
scow79::There's no point.  You're a Cavs fan, so obviously you're going to believe the Cavs future is brighter than the Jazz future.   Vice versa for Jazz fans.   It's pointless to argue when neither side is willing to budge from their chosen positions.
ensign.devyn::Hmmm... we are already better, we have Burks, Favors, and Kanter that still have yet to really develop, we have a history of being a winning organization and one of the most successful small market teams in the NBA, we have a competent coach, our front office is one of the most respected in the NBA, and one of the best at finding talent. Everything about the Jazz organization is superior.
go cavs275::Care to go into more detail on how the Jazz will be better? Cuz if not you can leave.
ensign.devyn::Hahaha. Everything for every Cleveland sport is in the future. Your original post about the Jazz being better than Cleveland in 3 years being categorized as delirious owns the stupidest point of the night.
go cavs275::What you don't think Kyrie or Dion are going to be superstars?  I can understand Dion because its early in his career but Kyrie is basically one already.
scow79::Planning on 3 more lottery picks are ya?
ensign.devyn::You put them in the wrong order, silly.
ensign.devyn::Anonymous team #1: 18 winning seasons in the last 20 years, a consistent playoff team, one good PG away from being a legit playoff contender.  Anonymous team #2: Had a few good seasons with a superstar player, but other than that, have been bottom dwellers of the NBA, being 2nd worst, 3rd worst, and 2nd worst the last 2 seasons.  Not knowing who they are, which team would you rather have?
ensign.devyn::CJ with a solid game, 4/11 from the field including 1/6 from 3 in 36 whole minutes.
LasVegasDDS::C.J. would show up maybe 10 games a year if my memory serves me correct.
ensign.devyn::Still shooting 30's in overall FG percentage too
scow79::He is shooting 38% from 3 so far this year.   He shot 30% with the Jazz last season and below that the year before.  Which leads me to believe altitude effects CJ's shooting.   It's the only thing I can think of.
ensign.devyn::Yep, 15 if he's having a good year.
LasVegasDDS::I like the young talent that the Jazz have acquired.  However, taking Alec Burks instead of Klay Thompson in the 2011 draft kind of stings.
scow79::Yeah except for the fact that GS took Klay Thompson before the Jazz could pick.  I believe Thompson went at #11 and Burks went to the Jazz at #12.
JohnsonnnL::Its not all one sided, some is just retaliation.
ensign.devyn::Klay's good for sure. Alec has a lot of potential too though, just needs the minutes. We'll see how he develops
ensign.devyn::Yeah, being a fan of the 2nd worst team in the league does craaaaaazy things to people
LasVegasDDS::Just got to the board and wow!  Can't believe how much trash Cavs' fans are talking.
ensign.devyn::TheBrownestBob And NO championships and only 2 finals appearances. Wow. Some bright history.  How many Finals appearances and how many rings does Cleveland have?
go cavs275::Cavs might not have the better team right now but they have the 2 best players on either roster.
jaydubespn::"Might not" have the better team right now?  You know the Jazz are over .500, right?
ensign.devyn::Yeah, 20 wins per year for the Cavs, and 6 wins per year for the Brown, on a good year.
go cavs275::Past is over and done with and all that actually matters is CHAMPIONSHIPS I don't care about anything else, and your ignorant if you do.  The Cavs and Browns are extremely young and those close games, will be wins in the coming years.
ensign.devyn::Do all the Cleveland teams always have a bright future? My point is look at the Browns history. Look at the Cavs. Neither team has sustained success for more than a couple years at a time. Jazz have had consistent success for the last 20 years.
go cavs275::Browns had shurmur as coach and have a bright future....Whats your point?
ensign.devyn::Just like the Browns and Cardinals lost close games, right buddy? How are those organizations doing in the NFL?
go cavs275::You know that one of our best players has been out for 15 games and that we've lost 15 or so games that were close in the 4th quarter due to inexperience.
rbmw263::god your dumb
go cavs275::He's averaging 19pts a game over his last 5, and Oh yeah he's a rookie.  Jazz have 0 super stars, not going to get out of the first round.
go cavs275::Well  I think OKC will win one too, and small market teams gotta be really bad before they get good.  It doesn't look like KD  is ever gonna leave.  The Cavs got a good core of Kyrie, Dion, TT, and Zeller, add our high draft pick this year with a few fillers and we will be fighting for a playoff spot next year and will only get better.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Have you noticed that outside San Antonio, small market teams don't win championships? They can get close and that is it, with the very, very, very rare anomaly. Lebron left because Cleveland sucks, the same reason players leave Utah.
go cavs275::Not having superstars is a terrible thing, have you not noticed thats what wins championships?  And just because some leave, alot stay too, especially with the core Cleveland has now.  Lebron left because we had a terrible team surrounding him, and he knew there was no way he could win a championship here, and looking back I agree.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I said he'd be good one day for whoever he plays for. Not having superstars is a good thing for a small market team. Superstars leave for big markets. Cleveland fans should know that.
go cavs275::Waiters is better and more talented than any player on your team.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::LOL. You go ahead with that. Although he will be a very good player for whatever team he plays on when bails.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::You can't count Kyrie Irving twice and he's surrounded by turds.
ensign.devyn::Cleveland's excuses are so funny. It's like Lebron crippled their brains as well as their organization.
TheBrownestBob::Coming from Utah, the land of polygamy and white people.  Wow, what a place to live in.  I'm sure it's very diverse.
2noodlekaboodle::Hunter, there is no inner city in salt lake. We don't have those kind of problems. BrownBob, don't hate, we got mexicans and polynesians in dis $@%!$.
ensign.devyn::"The land of polygamy and white people"? LMAO.
HunterF4444::Lol you're talking about the inner city. What inner city doesn't have those problems? The suburbs are quite nice.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Too bad it doesn't have the awful winters, crime, poor housing market, ridiculously high unemployment rate, high obesity rate and low educational rates of Cleveland.
HunterF4444::what excuses? We suck. We know that. We don't pretend to be good.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::We suck too. We're just better at it.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Cleveland is one of the worst cities in the entire country to live in. They're a miserable lot. Let them have their fun.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yes, good for me. Sucks for you.
HunterF4444::Then good for you.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Not even close, but I don't and wouldn't live in either place.
HunterF4444::Lol better than f*cking Utah...
TheBrownestBob::Jazz fans think making the playoffs in a league where 16/30 teams make it is an accomplishment.  That shows how low their expectations are.
ensign.devyn::18 of the last 20 years as winning seasons. That's some pretty good expectations, as is making the playoffs.
ensign.devyn::How many championships and final's appearances do you have?
TheBrownestBob::And NO championships and only 2 finals appearances.  Wow.   Some bright history.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Jazz fans think never tanking and staying competitive while rebuilding in a league that is run by big markets is an accomplishment.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Mediocre &gt; Cleveland
TheBrownestBob::Congratulations?  Must be nice to be consistently mediocre.
ensign.devyn::The Cavs are the Browns of the NBA. Oh, wait...
HunterF4444::The Jazz are the...wait, what is Utah's football team called?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::San Frandenver FortyBroncos
ensign.devyn::The Denver Niners.
TheBrownestBob::Nice to see Dion get to the FT line as much as he did in this game.  Everyone thought that would be a strength of his coming in but he did not show that part of his game much in the beginning of the year.  Since coming back from his injury, it seems like he's made a more conscious effort to get to the rim even when an open perimeter shot is available.
ensign.devyn::LMAO Cavs fans talking any sort of trash to the Jazz is just laughable.
TheBrownestBob::This is their second year of 'rebuilding', genius.  The first year was the tanking year without LeBron that netted them Kyrie.  Rebuilding started last year, not when LeBron left as they had no assets or cap room to work with.  Why ask dumb questions?  Why have a basketball team?  Revenue maybe?  Entertainment?  Do you get bent out of shape when your team loses?  Do you draw pleasure from talking trash to fans of teams you're beating but bow out of the conversation when your team is getting its $@% handed to them?  Are you that kind of super fan?
ensign.devyn::You mean every good FA didn't' want to come to Cleveland. Let's not lie here. Again, enjoy this, your 3rd year of rebuilding. Have fun maybe finishing 10th in the East in 4 years.
TheBrownestBob::Umm, it's called every good FA was off the market and all of their agents put a hold on Cleveland until LeBron made his choice.  He strangled the market.  Get learned.
ensign.devyn::So the year after Lebron, they just tanked the entire year? And they had no cap room even with Lebron gone? Haha. And yep, you've got me pegged. Jazz went through one year of rebuliding, like most organizations, and then got back to making the playoffs. We'll see when Cleveland even sniffs the playoffs next.
TheBrownestBob::Jazz fans talking trash to Cavs fans is equally laughable as Cavs fans have no real expectations for this team whatsoever.  We just want to see the rookies and 2nd year players play well.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Reachiiiiiiing.
ensign.devyn::You don't know the Jazz's history too well do you? Cleveland had a few good years with Lebron, Jazz have been consistently good for the last 20. Have fun with that
TheBrownestBob::See, Jazz fans can talk now because the Cavs have had 3 straight losing seasons for the first time in a while.  At least the Cavs could advance in a playoff round.  All the Jazz can hope to do is look competitive.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::8 seeds are better than tanking year in a year out hoping that another Lebron comes by.
TheBrownestBob::^ Not true.
ensign.devyn::Haha getting to the playoffs most every year and only having 2 losing seasons in the last 20 years is mediocrity? I'm sure plenty of organizations would love to be as mediocre as the Jazz, instead of being the powerhouse #27th or #28th best team in the NBA every year like Cleveland.
HunterF4444::The funny thing is, the Jazz can be mediocre forever. Enjoy those 8 seeds!
ensign.devyn::Not really, as the Jazz are a consistent playoff team and Cleveland's been a bottom feeder for the last 3 seasons. That's the sad part, that you don't have expectations. For hell's sakes you've been "rebuilding" and developing players for now 3 seasons. Why have a basketball team in your city if you don't have any expectations for them?
biger_deeds::19 is a season high for Favors, sad
scow79::Funny, bc that's Tristan Thompson's season high as well and he is averaging about 10 more minutes per game than Favors and 2 less FGA's.
rbmw263::scoring isnt his game, or what the Jazz ask him to do when he is on the floor.  Plus he never gets big minutes
ensign.devyn::So where's the Cavs fan that assured as all the Cavs would have a lead most of the game, and a double digit lead for a good part of it, and then cave in?
rbmw263::Hey...were halfway through the season  24 home games left, 17 road games.  im predicting 49 wins.  we've been around .500 on the road lately, so 9-8 on the road, 18-6 @ home
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::If the §chmucks would just play hard every game they could hit 54 or 55, but they take too many games off.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::"Rumor" has it the Celtics are considering dumping players and salaries to clear cap space for next year to start rebuilding. If that's the the case, maybe the Jazz could trade Millsap and Raja Bell to Boston for KG. Ha! If anyone could light a fire under Jefferson to actually attempt defense, it'd be KG and with Jefferson's O, even playing average D would make him one of the best big men in the league.
rbmw263::I want to elbow KG in the jaw too much to root for him
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Haha, I know what you mean. Imagine Jefferson playing average defense though. Average! That's all I ask.
MrJohnBasedow::I have some advice for the GM's, never draft a goofy white guy from a foreign country in the first round, ever!
MrJohnBasedow::haha @ ostertag.
Serg Abaka::Pau, Dirk???
Serg Abaka::Bogut has been good enough minus injuries
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::They're false centers.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::OSTERTAG!!!!
MrJohnBasedow::Both not true centers.
MrJohnBasedow::Center.
YogaBeer::Good Lord!    Usually when a team like the Jazz are one sprained ankle away from lottery, but are stuck in the hopeful for an 8th spot 1st round exit, their fans aren't so full of themselves.    This must be the exception.
rbmw263::we lost our starting PG for 3 months and we are in the 7 seed
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Maybe he meant "one more sprained ankle."
rbmw263::with 13 of the next 18 at home
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::And usually when a team is 10-32, have been one of the worst teams in the league for a few years in a row with nothing to show that will change anytime in the near future, the fans don't criticize another small market team who was been continuously successful.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::For a small market team, the Jazz have been one of the most consistently successful teams in the NBA. There are only three teams in NBA history to never lose 60+ games in a season, Lakers, Knicks, Jazz. Championships aren't for small market teams. Sometimes they get close, and in one case they finally broke through.
YogaBeer::I'm not criticizing any team that's continually successful.   However, neither of these teams are.
Serg Abaka::One sprained ankle to who?
YogaBeer::"whom"
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Jazz are nearly always in the playoffs. I can only speak for myself, have no delusions of grandeur, the NBA is not for small markets to win, San Antonio being the exception.
MrJohnBasedow::tremors I agree both areas are horrible places to reside. That has nothing to do with why Lebron left though. He left simply because he's a gutless coward when it comes down to crunch time. Even in the Nba finals when he won, he was a minor factor towards the end of the games. He's a scared little head case.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::He's a world-class d-bag and the best player in the world by a considerable margin. He left because he could live somewhere anyone who was in their 20s with millions of dollars would want to live.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Doesn't he have family in Ohio? If I had millions of dollars, I would have a house in Utah too, because I have family there.
YogaBeer::Then why does he live in Akron?
MrJohnBasedow::eh, I don't think he chose it for the area. I think it was more that he knew he could coast with a superstar team and the pressure wouldn't be on him.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Lebron left for the same reason players leave Utah. Cleveland sucks.
YogaBeer::So Tremors, you're saying Utah sucks as well.    Trolling yourself now?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I wouldn't live in either state.
YogaBeer::Just in case, Utah is a state, Cleveland is a city.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I wouldn't live in either place.
MrJohnBasedow::Lebron purely left because he needed others to carry him when he chokes. He couldn't take the pressure and needed a free pass to the title.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::And Cleveland sucks.
MrJohnBasedow::He still has a house in the cleveland akron area.
JohnsonnnL::I wish Kevin Jones would get more playing time instead of Walton.
YogaBeer::Or Casspi, or Luearerer (spell) or Pargo, or fill in the blank.
MrJohnBasedow::Hey tremors, one superstar away from 500? What were they when Lebron was here? Duh!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::A perpetual "We'll win next year" team.
MrJohnBasedow::Jazz are definitely not in that category. muhahaha!
YogaBeer::When did Utah ever win it?
Serg Abaka::Lebron is a once in a generation player. No free agent that good is going to Cleveland, which is why Lebron left
Serg Abaka::Maybe they will get a 'superstar' like Jamison again
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::No free agent other than Lebron is that good.
MrJohnBasedow::Lebron left because he didn't have the guts to finish it himself. Bottom line
MrJohnBasedow::Now they got kyrie and a better varajeo
rbmw263::Favors is averaging 15 11 and 2.5 blocks per 36.  Hes 21 years old.
rbmw263::troll harder
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::^ That's my troll comment
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::They're doing their best. Hard when the team you're trolling for is terrible and all they have is Kyrie "Empty Numbers" Irving.
MrJohnBasedow::8 points 6 boards
YogaBeer::And Luke Walton handled him like a fiddle.
MrJohnBasedow::Cavs are one superstar away from being a championship team. In two years watch gilbert pay it.
JohnsonnnL::We also need a bench
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Cavs are one superstar away from almost being a .500 club.
YogaBeer::there are no superstars on Utah
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Apparently 10-32 is good now.
MrJohnBasedow::We got Gilbert baby. He will spend cus he's Ballin'!!!
MrJohnBasedow::It will be in 2 years when we are competing in the playoffs! :)
BizzOrange::Whoa watch out, tremors pulled out his calculator.
YogaBeer::The question is, "Has a team with a .238 % ever made it to the PO the next year or two?"
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Has a team with a .238 win percentage ever made the playoffs?
YogaBeer::You don't know much about the NBA I see.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Well, 10-32 isn't very good, so it's unlikely it will ever be good enough to make the playoffs.
YogaBeer::and you know this how?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::10-32 won't make the playoffs in two years either.
MrJohnBasedow::So you guys are bragging about mr. 8 points per game and 6 boards a game Favors? HAHAHA!
rbmw263::talk to anyone who knows what the hell they are talking about.  Favors has a ton of upside
YogaBeer::Favors did show us some fight guarding Luke Walton tonight.
YogaBeer::Maybe that's the tradable asset they're talking about.   ANd they seem to be drooling over Luke Walton so I suggest a straight up trade.     Walton for Favors.
MrJohnBasedow::Scrub for scrub, sounds fair.
Real_Salt Lake::Jazz were in the lottery one year and are already stocked with young talent and trad-able assets. Cavs will be in the lottery for years to come.
YogaBeer::Cavaliers had a lottery once that propelled them in the NBA finals.  I just don't get how a team that is barely .500 thinks it's "stocked with young talent and tradable assets"
Real_Salt Lake::So Cavs at 10-30 must mean they don't have any young talent at all.
YogaBeer::I know.    Jazz are barely a .500 team.    We'll see how "stocked" they are.
MrJohnBasedow::Favors man! he's got 8 ppg and 6 boards. He's the next big thing!
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Well why would you? I'm sure you don't pay attention to Jazz basketball. Doesn't make it any less true.
MrJohnBasedow::We have Kyrie to build off and an owner willing to spend money. What do the Jazz have to build off? Some scrub named Milsap? BAHAHAHA!
Grantox::kyrie is gonna go the way lebron did
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Just kinda the way things work in the NBA. Small market teams have it the hardest. I hope he stays in Cleveland, but recent history is not on any small market teams side.
YogaBeer::You know this how?
Grantox::favors kanter burks and hayward jackassssss
rbmw263::Dont worry you will
MrJohnBasedow::Never heard of them.
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::Derrick Favors nuff said. I'm out Go Jazz!
Grantox::i really dont think you should criticise any jazz big as they are better then all your bigs
MrJohnBasedow::Our bigs suck besides varajeo.
MrJohnBasedow::Hey Kanter, idiot. I'm sure Obama doesn't care what people think about him, but that doesn't mean we don't have the right to criticize him. Welcome to America, bud! :)
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::Not sure where you are taking this but ok...
Grantox::yeah he was the guy dominating your entire team tonight! luckily hayward had a bad night or it coulda got nasty! kanter is the one that ate your bigs for breakfast!
MrJohnBasedow::Kanter!!?? haha never heard of him, must be garbage big time!
JazzFanFromINDIA::Does Cleveland has a basketball team ?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_basketball_team
MrJohnBasedow::Does India? Go home.
MrJohnBasedow::Favors? Never heard of him. Must be garbage.
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::I doubt Favors cares whether "MrJohnBasedow" has heard of him lmao
YogaBeer::Off night shooting for Kyrie, but good with the 9 assists.     Rookies Waiters and Zeller both having good nights as does Double T.     However, every time Luke steps on the court I change the channel.    Can't take this team serious when a clown is on the court.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Walton was the only reason the game didn't get ridiculously out of hand in the 3rd quarter.
YogaBeer::Walton has no energy and it IS the point.   Who cares about a meaningless game other than the development of it's players?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Agreed. The Jazz play Jefferson and Millsap over Favors and Kanter and it drives all Jazz fans crazy. That's not the point. Walton played high energy D and disrupted the Jazz flow. Kept it from being a 20+ point lead in the third quarter.
YogaBeer::You don't play a slow incompetent player over younger players on a team that is rebuilding.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::His energy and defense in the third truly did keep it from getting out of hand. I was surprised.
YogaBeer::dumb troll at that
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::"We'll win next year" should be the citywide slogan for Cleveland.
YogaBeer::^ Troll ^
MrJohnBasedow::I thought our slogan was "greatest city in America"?
YogaBeer::Come to think of it, other than having sister wives, what has Utah ever won?
YogaBeer::What's wrong with the winters?
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Horrible winters, high crime rate, high unemployment rate, terrible housing market and perpetual losers in all pro sports.... Sounds awesome.
MrJohnBasedow::Do the Jazz have a player as good as Kyrie?
ghettoslider::the jazz dont have a gaurd thats better than kyrie but they have 4 big guys that are better than any of the big guys on the cavs
JazzFanFromINDIA::Basketball is a team game. Nuff Said.
Enes Kanter owns Dwight Howard::Favors is a pretty good young player
MrJohnBasedow::Any answer other than no is wrong.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Wonder who he'll be playing for in 5 years.
ghettoslider::i have all the jazz wins this year on DVD and i love watching jefferson and milsap play
MrJohnBasedow::Cavs will win a title within ten years. Dan Gilbert!!!!!!
JazzFanFromINDIA::10 years ? lol ....Glad to know you are happy about it.
JazzFanFromINDIA::Bucks now lead by 20 ...lmao
ghettoslider::favors was in the same draft as blake griffin and even though blake started off stronger out of the gate, favors just took a little longer to develope but he is closing the gap between him and griffin
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Favors has a better shot. Depends on who wants to work harder.
ChumRoastBeef::When walton get's fouled out, it's our time to win the game. - Cleveland fans
