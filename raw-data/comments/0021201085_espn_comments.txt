MafiosoSpaghetti::god...dirk is the $@%!$@% king of dallas...unbelieveable last min.l
DerekPHX::Dallas Vs Lakers on Tuesday, very big game!
scabbfan::Dirty player Taj Gibson had all of 6 pts &amp; Bulls lost.  Guess he didn't assault &amp; mug Dirk.  NOTE NBA UPGRADED HIS LEBRON FOUL TO FLAGGRANT.
1522scooter::If this was against Miami trhe story would be "Carter tackles Butler for the win!"
Constantinius III::Dirk  looks fully back, which is great. Now that Barea and JET are off the team -- two of the most annoying/overrated players in the entire NBA -- I can finally go back to being a passionate Mavs supporter, though they aren't really my primary team.
Jordanbetonbasketball1990-1998::Jimmy Butler. .....not ready.
Fafi-Heatle305::That Damn Dirk still gives me nightmares lol
Balticplayer::Lotn: Lebron James 10P/10R/10A, Runner up: Kobe 30 P/ 8 TOs on 5/25FG 20/20 Fts  ("Who's that big guy called Dirk who just scored 40P/12R on 18/20FG?")  ------------------------------------- Chris Palmer
patriots_fan13::If someone on the Heat did what Dirk just did, it would be front page news for a week.  He does it and it gets buried.
andrewpalooza::The Mavs are under 500. The Heat are 35 games over 500.
Fafi-Heatle305::It was a great game dude... Its not about the headlines. that man has proved himself.
AIR4CE SPEED::"We should have done more tackling..."  -Hinrich
smokingstogies305::The Bulls remain irrelevant.  "We beat the Heat"....I guess worthless moral victories are what you celebrate when  your team has been irrelevant for over a decade.
AIR4CE SPEED::Say word...!
FeFyeFoeRun::So True. Just a sorry franchise since Pippen stopped carrying Jordan.
Calvin9299::I'd be willing to bet that another 6 gets Dallas in
Fanucci2111::Do the Mavs own the tie-breakers over the lakers and the jazz?
Calvin9299::If your Dallas obviously, or a big fan, you don't want it going to the so called scorecards anyway. Just keep winning now...., when it counts.
Fanucci2111::So that means there is lies a little more work ahead of Dirk.
_Pyro27::Jazz own the tiebreaker on the Mavs regardless because they won the season series. If Dallas beats LA on Tuesday then the tiebreaker would come down to who has the better conference record which the Lakers do at the moment.
Calvin9299::Imagine where they'd be if he didn't sit so long, injured.
Calvin9299::I'd like to know too, there it is as I was typing. A definitive NO ! I'd be concerned with putting a streak together at the right time anyway,not letting it go to the scorecard if u get my drift ! Lol
_Pyro27::No
Calvin9299::Dallas isn't out of it yet. The Lakers and Utah are barely ahead.  It should be tight down the stretch for the 8 spot, no locks !
Dirk2XMVP::Dirk = Greatness
Neil826::the mavs are pathetic, horrible loss for the bulls bench.
Calvin9299::Not sure I agree. These guys have been playing together long enough. If he's healthy now, he should be in now, if not... Coming back to boost his team in the playoffs can't be bad. He is their best player healthy .
LetsGoMavs-::Only reason Mavs are not in the playoff race at the moment is because Dirk missed the first 27 games of the season. At least he's not a girl like Derrick Rose and sit out for the whole year even if he's ok enough to play
_Pyro27::Don't know why Rose would wait until the playoffs to play. Him coming back in the playoffs would be worse for the Bulls than if he were to not come back at all this season.
Calvin9299::Perceptions are a funny thing, especially living on the outside like fans do.  With that said, I'm careful not to jump the gun, but I have wondered why Rose is still out. Perhaps he's waiting for the playoffs.
Calvin9299::If Dallas is currently pathetic, and granted their quite mediocre I agree, then what exactly does it say for above average Chicago ? When's Rose coming back lol ?
Michael28653::CHI TOWN STAND UP DA BULLS
Michael28653::WHERE THE HEAT FANS AT?
Fafi-Heatle305::We here on PrimeTime on Easter sunday baby lol Heeeeeatle Mania
CHITOWNBULLS1991::I think they left. Were talking mad crap earlier though.
Calvin9299::So he thinks your a troll, I think you'll be ok regardless. Lol
CHITOWNBULLS1991::One claimed I was a troll after I even admitted LBJ and the Heat were both the best in the NBA.
Sean88142::Not that they have much to say...
oczonie::What remark will Cuban say next to inflame the Lakers?
WestBetterThanEast::14-17, 5-6 from three, 2 FTA.... Damn Dirk is looking pretty good. Dallas is peaking at a great time.
Calvin9299::No guarantees, but the Lakers and Jazz aren't exactly reliable.
calimazda3::Make no mistake. A prime Nowitski was one of the elite scorers in NBA history.
sandshr3w::and one to that! there's only a few players who has the heart to win in the playoffs like dirk has.. he's special..
Shamed_Shaun::somebody stop that boy dirk. hes in playoff shape
Michael28653::IF ONLY THEY WERE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS
wunderrr::DIRK 14-17 shooting with the game winner 3 &gt; KOBE 5-18 shooting with 0-3 in 4th
wadeisthegreatest03::This proves bulls got lucky against heat mavs aren't better then the heat but they won.
Hoovr61::Did boozer get ejected for that punch?
sandshr3w::no guess he apologized on it.. but am sure its in for shaqtin a fool.. ^_^
AustinM566::Please let the mavs win two  more games so we can finally stop having to see an entire team of Grizzly Adams.
ESmodPN::LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!! LAKERS WILL GO 16-0 IN THE PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!!

Master .Of. Everything::Stick a fork in the Bulls.  They've already won their title ending the Heat's streak in regular season play.
Sean88142::Nah. Just getting started.
cubsbearsfan61::nah u a hater
Clippers No.1::Dirk is such a tank.
Sportaddition1314::Clippers fan huh...good luck doing any damage in the playoffs with Vinnie as your coach and the most overrated power forward ever in Blake Griffin.
nightbladehunter::Bulls fans shouldn't talk about overrated power forwards when they have a power forward that vanishes come playoff time every year.
grimms7257::Great way for the Bulls to bounce back from the Miami game. Where are all the Bulls fans talking crap that the Bulls will beat the Heat in the playoffs?
Sean88142::Butt-hurt
Sportaddition1314::I'm a Bulls fan...any other Bulls fan talking $@%! like we can beat the Heat in a 7 game series because of 1 game is an idiot. If the Heat stay healthy then no one can beat them in a best of 7. If that was a lot of the conversation then I am embarrassed to be a Bulls fan. Some people are just basketball retar..ded and don't know this game. On the other hand if grimms7257 just made all that up then you can eat a deeek. Heat fans blow any way and will stop being fans once Lebron is gone.
geeman217::KOKA Roach Heat fan come over to Chgo site to talk crap about a loss NOT concerning them...  HOW BUTT HURT ARE YOU DUDE?  You should be embarrassed...
blabla2k::dirk make basket
KevinHate::Dirk just might clutch his way into a playoff spot. Wow.
The Evillllll Empire::I see the sun stopped shining on the dogs as. Heard the parade chicago had for that win in march was bananas. Bottle poppin, horn honkin, ticker tape, the whole nine! Cant imagine the parade when you get to 40 wins!!
geeman217::You know you sound "Butt Hurt" dontcha?
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::I'm not a troll but I'm going to be the first one to talk crap to heat fans as soon as they lose a game  -CHITOWNBULLS1991
CHITOWNBULLS1991::If you see me tomorrow by all means feel free to copy/paste, but you won't. Haven't been on a Heat board in months, and when I am I'm saying I think they'll win. Good night though. And what reason do I have to troll, i've already admitted Lebron is the best player in the NBA and the Heat are the best team. But yeah, i'm a troll.
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::Don't worry I will and any other time too
CHITOWNBULLS1991::If you can find posts of me saying that i'd be glad to see them :)
Rays_Heat_Bucs_Lightning_Awwwwyeaaaaaaaaa::CHITOWNBULLS1991 - Guarantee I won't be trolling a heat game on easter.  Mmmmm hmmmmm

CHITOWNBULLS1991::Good Luck!
CHITOWNBULLS1991::I'm thankful the Heat weren't able to make history, but there is no point arguing with Heat fans who have come to troll a Bulls loss to the Mavericks. Goodnight Everyone!
Fafi-Heatle305::D.Rose dont even want to play for you guys lmao
AIR4CE SPEED::The Heat have already made history.  Meanwhile....your team IS history. Have fun watching the Playoffs after the Bulls get dismissed again..Rose will be watching, too. LOL
The Evillllll Empire::I see the sun stopped shining on the dogs asz. Heard the parade was off the chain for that win in march against the heat you had. Bottles poppin, car horn honkin, ticker tape, the whole nine! Can imagine the party when you win your 40th.
