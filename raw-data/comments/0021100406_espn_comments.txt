DTangMF::I like the way Stan uses Courtney Lee couple years ago, his young legs gave us a nice boost in the playoff and help get us to the Final...

Dave5227::Dwight missed 10 shots within 7 feet of the rim...Oh please come play for my team for a 100 million dollars because you are such a leader and dedicated to winning
lucast23::Warning, we have an idiot
the702shogun::finally, it's only taken one of the richardsons 28 games to get going. otis, find a pure scorer somewhere and another point guard!
inthepaint32::That's the old J-Rich that use to see...
rsleepo::Richardson with the Warriors A- Richardson with the Bobcats B Richardson with the Suns C+ Richardson with the Magic D
twinstj2008::I was at the game and Richardson might not be having a great year, but if it wasn't for his three pointers in the 4th the Magic would have been beat by 10...then again if the Bucks remember how to play defense and Skiles put in a sub or two in the last ten minutes of the game to get fresh legs...all those open three might not have happened.
camavermic::Predictions..................................  1. The Magic will NOT trade D12 because they will get no offers to their liking.  2. The Magic will start a campaign to try to keep D12 in Orlando by constantly stating that he will lose $30 million if he becomes a FA.     ( this is because they have nothing else to offer him).  3. D12 leaves via FA to his first choice, theBrooklyn Nets, after Adidas agrees to increase their contract to make up for money lost in FA.  4. DWill stays with the Nets.
Mightymoose02::1. LOL... okay then you can lose him for nothing.   2. Dwight doesn't care about 30 million. Look at Lebron and Wade. Sponsorship money will cover that no problem.  3. Unless he wants to join a team with nobody on it.. then sure Nets are great choice  4. 50/50 at this point
Dwight Coward::j rich lighting it up
otownmagic4life::MY BOY J RICH ON FIYAHHHHH
kzwider::Kobe now knows who Jeremy Lin is haha what a $@%!$@ Kobe can be ...you guys see that interview? http://www.the-outfielder.com/2012/02/kobe-meets-jeremy-lin.html
buckspackers23::Can't believe we shat away a 10 point lead into a 7 point deficit in 2 and a half minutes...
miaheatbabe::damn it looks like j richardson had a great game tonight too bad i missed the game
KiNgJr4ReAl::I dont understand if Stan Van Gundy was trying to save Richardson in the long run like next game etc, It really puzzles me why he gets bench when just starting to play well.
fliptide..::because Stan Van Gundy is a vindictive asshole.  petty and mean.
GatorMasta::And wow...Damn J-Rich didn't know ya still had it in you... Can you keep it up please?
bradyandjrich::He's capable of drilling threes consistently.
rockndoc2::OK, Orlando Fan.   Would you be willing to give up a first round pick for Jamison/Turkoglu?  Cavs take a bad contract, Jamison helps you this year , then expires.
fliptide..::Not good for Magic... Turk is the only guy who can/will pass to Dwight in the post.  Also, still a good 4th quarter guy.
GatorMasta::Hmm...Intersting... Since we're more than likely gonna lose Dwight anyway probably not.. But very interesting trade.  Why would the Cavs want Turk?
IAMpunter2609::About $@% time Jrich, hasnt been the same since leaving PHX. Magic need to sort a point guard asap on account of Nelson being a swamp donkey. Trade turk, nelson, reddick for bayless and calderon
bradyandjrich::He simply got the ball more in PHX. Nash at PG, Amare at PF. He was able to score 16-20 a game consistently. In Orlando, he has not gotten the ball as much as he should be getting it. Tonight he proved how much of an asset he is. Just giving him the ball more.
tampasportsrule::SVG almost cost the Magic this game tonight. J-Rich sat for too long. Wafer needs to get more pt. And what about Liggins ?
DTangMF::SVG needs to get Liggins ready for the playoff, he is capable to be our best on ball defender
Phunkatron::Stan Ran Jeremy
kazam92::How the hell do you go 9-11 from three and 0-4 from the line?
the702shogun::it's the magic way
bradyandjrich::Haha J-Rich has always been an excellent three point shooter but so-so from the FT line. But, since he was definitely feeling it tonight, it does not add up at all.
Saleaky::TUPAC'S BACK, TUPAC'S BACK, THAT'S WHAT THESE bit.ches. SCREAMING THAT TUPAC'S BACK!
openminded43::Bet ya that never happened before or will again!!!
KiNgJr4ReAl::Whats the bet J-Rich gets no respect and all the headlines say good team effort from guys like Redick and Duhon
tampasportsrule::In the Magic next game J-Rich will score a total of ____ points?
rsleepo::5
bradyandjrich::40.
Phunkatron::Ms America is from a suburb of Milwaukee, BOOM

openminded43::One of the WC's will come from the west!!!
tampasportsrule::This doesn't count as a blown prediction on my part because I was unaware that the game was being played in Milwaukee.
openminded43::I think there were strong North westerly winds tonight too!!! LOL
Saleaky::Yeah Free throw air LMFREAKINGAO
Domowild::can I borrow your crafted couch??

MagicBoltzRays::why are you still here ClownonFire?
MagicBoltzRays::tampasportsrule IF and I mean IF the Magic should win then I promise to NEVER POST IN HERE AGAIN....that is how confident I am that the Magic LOST this game tonight. Next.
Domowild::hahahaha, he is a MAGIC fan... he was fucking around thats all....
Saleaky::TUPAC'S BACK, TUPAC'S BACK, THAT'S WHAT THESE bit.ches. SCREAMING THAT TUPAC'S BACK!
xCookieMonstax1::you guys better go kill that fan that told jrich he was washed up lmao

KiNgJr4ReAl::Everybody hates on J-Rich but he's all heart and always has been
openminded43::He, like all the other wing players need a PG to get him the ball in the right place!!!
openminded43::Hey tampasports..... you got this one???
tampasportsrule::Dude wtf ?..Ok cool. Next.
openminded43::Still at 85%???
jbilancione::they needed that..loss would have put us with the same amt of losses as Boston
surfzone365::Da Bucks CLAPSE!
MetsNLChamps2012::Can't believe I lost that bet, what a terrible loss Bucks... How can you blow that?
flexdafunk::By telling J-Rich he's washed up. Should have kept their mouth shut
MetsNLChamps2012::Magic are streaky, I figured it was a crap shoot whether they show up or not... Guess Richardson had other ideas
Domowild::I agree with you... Magics got the potential but sometimes I dont know...
Domowild::are you serious... you tought the Bucks were going to win?? come on...
openminded43::ALL road 2B2B's are good wins!!!
DirtBaGP::GAME TIME
Saleaky::TUPAC'S BACK, TUPAC'S BACK, THAT'S WHAT THESE bit.ches. SCREAMING THAT TUPAC'S BACK!
MagicBoltzRays::Three Stars 1. JASON FREAKING RICHARDSON 2. Hedo 3. Redick
ImYourHuckleberry.::I think J-Rich should shoot his FT's from the 3 pt line.
mr_etisalat::me too
Stan Van Gundy Rulez::you cant jump on free throws and J-Rich can jump outter the building
Saleaky::TUPAC'S BACK, TUPAC'S BACK, THAT'S WHAT THESE HOLES SCREAMING THAT TUPAC'S BACK!!!
xXDowntown Bomber32Xx::Jeez, if there was like 10 seconds still in the game Magic would lose from all of these missed free throws
Stan Van Gundy Rulez::Howard feels much better when he sees J-Rich miss free throws
galingako::score now pls?
mr_etisalat::dont blame jrich for missing fts..  its like someone asking u to drive 20mph  after uve been blasting by at 100mph all day
MagicalDiesel::J-Rich is my new favorite Magic player
mr_etisalat::J rich missing fts.. his reason?? the basket is too close...  needs to move to 3pt line to make those fts
openminded43::How 80% career FT shooters can't make FT's all of a sudden is a mystery to me!!!
jbilancione::this lockout compacted season has made alot of things odd....
tampasportsrule::j-rich needs to shoot his ft's from the 3 point line.
Domowild::you cant comment here anymore my friend.. you promised...
MagicBoltzRays::***2ND HALF*** J-RICH IN 27-16 MAGIC Run 21-6 MAGIC Run  J-RICH OUT 23-8 BUCKS Run
