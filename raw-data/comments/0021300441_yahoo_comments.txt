FreeTruth1945::Disappointing to say the least. Need to realign this team's personnel. Make the Deng trade or sign him. Nikola Mirotic should be brought over for next year. D.J. Augustin should be kept. Hinrich should be packaged in a trade. He has value, but simply can not play extended minutes anymore. Trade Boozer for an expiring contract. Start playing Murphy at backup center. Convince Derek Rose to change his style of play.
fed up::Only 11 free throws again tonight.Mav's are just afraid to go inside or drive to the bucket..Just won't continue to win with that attitude.11 free throws thats terrible. How many times this season have they shot 15 free throws or less.I know its cost them a bunch of games already this season
LeBlow Job James::Good job Bulls, the tanking continues. With the first selection in the 2014 NBA draft, the chicago Bulls select Jabari Parker out of the university of Duke.
James R::Where the hell was Jimmy Butler (2-10, 1-7 3point) and Tony Snell (0-8, 0-5 3point) at in this game? Dallas's defense wasn't that great.
Mister E::The Mavs are surprisingly good this year, but they have no shot at a CHIP as currently constituted.  I wonder if Cuban takes the plunge and tries to get Bynum?? especially if he`s waived or bought out.
Phil::The real question is, will anyone please take Boozer in a trade?  Please?
jzreal::boozer sucks
- LJ::put the number 8 in the west (dallas) in the east and they will be in the finals... if they conpete against weak east teams they will be on top...
Brad::bulls get up to play only when they face the heat and that's about it.
Guy::D.J. Augustin  looks great !
