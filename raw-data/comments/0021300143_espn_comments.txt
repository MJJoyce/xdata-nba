Andrew Jackson::Anthony Davis is better than Blake, probably a fringe top 5 big at this point. Could be the best by seasons end
Daniel Tuggle::What a Beat Down... Davis would've had a Triple Double with Blks had he stayed in if it was close
Kool Kev::WoW!!!! Philly lost by 37 points!!! Sh#% even Austin Rivers got in on that action.

Stephen Bertucci::Geez, Davis had 5 blocks plus 4 rebounds in the 1st quarter?  I guess the 1st two posts called it, "Anthony Davis will pound sixers".

Brent Bj Bacon::m disappointed in this gamecast as this game is well into the 4th quarter.
Ron Schaffer::Big game off the bench by Ryan Anderson.
Adam Youman::Lol worst defensive team in the league
Jason McRoberts::Welcome back Ryan Anderson.
Adam WhoDat Hastak::Anthony Davis will pound sixers
Matthew Welker::goes to show how big of impact ryno is
Charmaine Lannes Hastak::Anthony Davis will pound sixers
Dave Jones::Where can we watch online?
