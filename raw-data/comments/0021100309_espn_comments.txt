TheFutureGhostofJoeTait:::)
ACandOJ::Pop Champagne!!!! The C's are finally .500!!!
_misterfurious::Anytime you read the headline "Celtics hold on, avenge loss to Cavs" you know the Celtics have fallen a long way.
SnotSteveBarryToshi::Wow the Celtics really DO suck! How come Ainge isn't doing anything? The guy is the worst GM ever.Other than McHale handing us Garnett what has this P.O.S. done? He should have left Horry's stinking towel on his face and disappeared. Bum built his rep hitting WIDE OPEN jumpers on a team with Bird, Parrish, and McHale. Let's see that loser get drafted in today's MLB or NBA. Good luck fool. Time for a change but I doubt our idiot ownership group has the ballz to do it. FU Ainge you puss y.
KungFuHustle1981::Ever since the Perkins trade our team has went down hill fast, things are so jacked up now even if we got Perkins back we would still suck badly.
Cadillac_Too_Cold::Wow the Celtics really suck
wazzupp4::heres the trade (im a celtics fan) cavs trade anderson varjoe, tristain thompson, jamison., 1st round pick for howard
nba is the worst::That would serve Dwight right!
KungFuHustle1981::The Celtics almost let this one slip away, our post presence is pathetic, Anderson Varaejo looked like David Robinson in the post against the Celtics. The Celtics are weak and pathetic in the post, we make guys like Anderson Varaejo and Marcin Gortat look like perennial all stars.
jayroberts59::Kyrie has way more upside than rubio. Rubio is a steve nash without the scoring.  Rubio to me is going to be another jason kidd, someone who will get assists but not that many points and will need a star to carry him like a dirk or kevin love. Kyrie is a star he has a better jump shot than rose and better finish at the basket than john wall. put all that together and he is a top 5 pg in 3 years.
Dwayne_Johnson23::C's!
nba is the worst::.500!
nba is the worst::Has he been on the boards yet this season?  I've seen Jdz and Celtsfan91477 a couple of times
Dwayne_Johnson23::No Rondo, no cat
nba is the worst::Sorry there's (virtually) only one Celtics fan left!  What happened to the pussycat, anyway?
Dwayne_Johnson23::Sorry you're a little bi.tch that whines about everything
nba is the worst::Sorry you're irritated by facts - like "ONE AND DONE"!
Dwayne_Johnson23::Yup got the message last night, you can stop being a tool now
Dwayne_Johnson23::Yup, got the message last night.  Stop being a bi.tch now
Rondo is the bum of bums::test
ilmuse::get casspi of my team that guy $@%!$@% sucks
nba is the worst::Gee is talented - I'd start the guy
Dwayne_Johnson23::*off
Road dog Red::Playoffs...did you say PLAYOFFS
CandySparker::I like Kylie Minogue.
Dwayne_Johnson23::SHUTUP
lenbiasfanz::Kyrie Irving! ... Kyrie Irving! ... Kyrie Irving! ... Kyrie Irving! ...
Kyrie Irving..........ROY::True story,  Kyrie Irving had his 10th game of 20 or more points scored in a game.  Ricky Rubio has ZERO.
Colinb0001::Look at Kyrie's shooting numbers though; 50%+ field goal percentage isnt the result of being on a bad team.
34BigDaddyO::Just like Gilbert Arenas when he was on the Wiz, and now with John Wall for an example: Good players on bad teams are going to get the stats. If Iriving was on the Twolves I think his assists would go up, but his scoring would go down. I didn't say Irving was a bad player, but I think Rubio has more upside and will have the better career.
jayroberts59::Kyrie has way more upside than rubio. Rubio is a steve nash without the scoring.  Rubio to me is going to be another jason kidd, someone who will get assists but not that many points and will need a star to carry him like a dirk or kevin love. Kyrie is a star he has a better jump shot than rose and better finish at the basket to john wall. put all that together and he is a top 5 pg in 3 years.
34BigDaddyO::Rubio is a true point guard, Irving is not. Cavs need him to score, Twolves don't need Rubio to score. True story.  Rubio &gt; Irving
BlkMexMamba_SomeBS::First of all, Beasly is garbage. But Rubio does have Kevin Love. I have good eye for talent, right now. Kyrie is better than Ricky, but overtime.. Ricky is gonna be one helluva player.
MikeD3321::What do you mean by "true PG"?  Because he has more assists?  Ever think that Irving is more efficient of a player?    He has a better FG %, 3pt %, scores more points on a worse team.  Think about if he had players like Beasley and Love, his assists numbers would look much better
whopped1::actaully k
Dallas fans are Trolls::wolves=nba's up and coming big thing
Hugh G.Wreckshin::I have a big thing that is up and cuming
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::This Just in: In spite of everyone's wishes, the City of Cleveland and it's basketball team and their fans were not swallowed up into a galactic vortex. Looks like you'll just have to pray harder tomorrow.

monboy08::Do me a favor and turn down the heat please? Teds mom called up to him.  Sure mom, lemme just hit the bathroom and then Ill do it.  Ted went into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.  It was a day like any other day for the 16 year old.  Not a particularly exciting day, though not a terribly boring one.  Little did Ted know that he was about to have the strangest day of his life.  Ted sat down on the toilet and grabbed the only reading material available, a copy of this months All About Beer magazine.  A third of the way through his read, he decided it was time to continue with life and take that garbage out for his mom.  He washed his hands, tossed the magazine on top of the toilet and opened the bathroom door.  Ted stared into nothingness.  Outside of the bathroom there was simply nothing.  An infinite empty void stretched out in front of him.  Horrified, Ted tried screaming - first for his mom, then for anyone.  The blackness swallowed his words.  Ted stretched his arm nervously into the space but could feel nothing.  He grabbed a bar of soap and tossed it out the door as hard as he could.  It fell, fell far into the blank universe and out of sight.  Im dreaming!  I must be dreaming! Ted told himself as he closed the door and cowered in a corner.  He dared not open the door again and look into that terrible space.  Eventually, mind numb with fright, Ted fell asleep.  Early the next morning (though little did Ted realize, time was about to lose all meaning for him) Ted awoke, still curled into a tight ball of fear.  He walked slowly towards the door, rightfully afraid to open it.  When he did, nothing had changed.  The vast emptiness still stood before him, apparently encompassing all of existence except for his bathroom.  He began to scream again, hoping for anyone or anything to hear him, but it was futile.  By the third day, Ted had calmed down enough to find out his new world.  The toilet still worked, as did the sink faucet.  Not caring if he lived or died at this point, Ted drank some of the sink water and found it was quite good.  He also noticed that while he was thirsty, he wasnt ever hungry.  Whether this was permanent or the result of his shock, he wasnt sure.  The lights also worked fine, though Ted was too scared to shut them off for more than a moment to check their functioning.  A week had passed now.  It was confirmed - Ted no longer got hungry.  His thirst could be quenched by drinking from the sink. The toilet still flushed fine and the shower ran and drained properly.  By now, Ted had begun to lose track of time; his main daily activity was to open and close the bathroom door several times throughout the day to see if the normal world would return.  Ted got through his first month fairly easily.  He had started working out every day by doing pushups and situps, leg lifts, planks, and any other exercise he could think of that didnt require weights. Hed read his issue of All About Beer about 100 times and was fairly sick of it.  By the end of his first year, Ted was exhausted.  His life was boring.  All he did was work out, drink water, re-read his issue of All About Beer, and ponder questions about the nature of the universe and reality, as well as daily questions about suicide.  The one thing that kept him from killing himself was the thought that throwing his body into the void may somehow make him an immortal, forever falling into blackness.  He was still aging, that was certain, and he assumed that at least in this bathroom hed eventually die, even if he was raving mad by that time.  After 5 years, Ted decided to see how long he could go without a shower until he was too disgusted with himself to stand it.  He made it 47 days.  After 7 years, Ted finally ran out of toothpaste.  In his eighth year he ran out of interesting things to build with the empty toothpaste boxes and tossed them into the void.  In his tenth year, Ted decided to shave his now massive beard.  He didnt have a razor or shaving cream, so using tweezers he plucked a single hair at a time.  This irritated his skin very quickly, so he had to take many breaks.  The process took 3 days before he was finished.  In his twentieth year, Ted was strong enough to do 2-finger pushups like Bruce Lee.  He was also quite bored with his workout routine.  By his fortieth year in the bathroom, Ted had made friends with the light socket, because it seemed to have a little face.  He called it Socky and had conversations with it every day, going into great detail about the things he would do when he got out of the bathroom, and what the world might be like now.  Finally, at the age of 84, Ted had a heart attack and died.  Ted! shouted his mother from the bottom of the stairs, Youve been in that bathroom for over an hour now!  Are you OK?  When Ted didnt answer, his mom came upstairs to check on him.  Ted? she said outside the door.  When he still didnt answer, she opened the door and screamed.  On the floor was a naked old man.  He was bald and had a long scraggly beard which went down to near his feet.  His mouth was open in a twisted smile, though no teeth remained.  In his hands he clutched a yellowed copy of what looked to be All About Beer magazine.  The man bore a definite resemblance to her son Ted, though even after an extensive police investigation, he was never seen again.

Ted got through his first month fairly easily.  He had started working out every day by doing pushups and situps, leg lifts, planks, and any other exercise he could think of that didnt require weights. Hed read his issue of All About Beer about 100 times and was fairly sick of it.  By the end of his first year, Ted was exhausted.  His life was boring.  All he did was work out, drink water, re-read his issue of All About Beer, and ponder questions about the nature of the universe and reality, as well as daily questions about suicide.  The one thing that kept him from killing himself was the thought that throwing his body into the void may somehow make him an immortal, forever falling into blackness.  He was still aging, that was certain, and he assumed that at least in this bathroom hed eventually die, even if he was raving mad by that time.  After 5 years, Ted decided to see how long he could go without a shower until he was too disgusted with himself to stand it.  He made it 47 days.  After 7 years, Ted finally ran out of toothpaste.  In his eighth year he ran out of interesting things to build with the empty toothpaste boxes and tossed them into the void.  In his tenth year, Ted decided to shave his now massive beard.  He didnt have a razor or shaving cream, so using tweezers he plucked a single hair at a time.  This irritated his skin very quickly, so he had to take many breaks.  The process took 3 days before he was finished.  In his twentieth year, Ted was strong enough to do 2-finger pushups like Bruce Lee.  He was also quite bored with his workout routine.  By his fortieth year in the bathroom, Ted had made friends with the light socket, because it seemed to have a little face.  He called it Socky and had conversations with it every day, going into great detail about the things he would do when he got out of the bathroom, and what the world might be like now.  Finally, at the age of 84, Ted had a heart attack and died.  Ted! shouted his mother from the bottom of the stairs, Youve been in that bathroom for over an hour now!  Are you OK?  When Ted didnt answer, his mom came upstairs to check on him.  Ted? she said outside the door.  When he still didnt answer, she opened the door and screamed.  On the floor was a naked old man.  He was bald and had a long scraggly beard which went down to near his feet.  His mouth was open in a twisted smile, though no teeth remained.  In his hands he clutched a yellowed copy of what looked to be All About Beer magazine.  The man bore a definite resemblance to her son Ted, though even after an extensive police investigation, he was never seen again.
monboy08::Do me a favor and turn down the heat please? Teds mom called up to him.  Sure mom, lemme just hit the bathroom and then Ill do it.  Ted went into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.  It was a day like any other day for the 16 year old.  Not a particularly exciting day, though not a terribly boring one.  Little did Ted know that he was about to have the strangest day of his life.  Ted sat down on the toilet and grabbed the only reading material available, a copy of this months All About Beer magazine.  A third of the way through his read, he decided it was time to continue with life and take that garbage out for his mom.  He washed his hands, tossed the magazine on top of the toilet and opened the bathroom door.  Ted stared into nothingness.  Outside of the bathroom there was simply nothing.  An infinite empty void stretched out in front of him.  Horrified, Ted tried screaming - first for his mom, then for anyone.  The blackness swallowed his words.  Ted stretched his arm nervously into the space but could feel nothing.  He grabbed a bar of soap and tossed it out the door as hard as he could.  It fell, fell far into the blank universe and out of sight.  Im dreaming!  I must be dreaming! Ted told himself as he closed the door and cowered in a corner.  He dared not open the door again and look into that terrible space.  Eventually, mind numb with fright, Ted fell asleep.  Early the next morning (though little did Ted realize, time was about to lose all meaning for him) Ted awoke, still curled into a tight ball of fear.  He walked slowly towards the door, rightfully afraid to open it.  When he did, nothing had changed.  The vast emptiness still stood before him, apparently encompassing all of existence except for his bathroom.  He began to scream again, hoping for anyone or anything to hear him, but it was futile.  By the third day, Ted had calmed down enough to find out his new world.  The toilet still worked, as did the sink faucet.  Not caring if he lived or died at this point, Ted drank some of the sink water and found it was quite good.  He also noticed that while he was thirsty, he wasnt ever hungry.  Whether this was permanent or the result of his shock, he wasnt sure.  The lights also worked fine, though Ted was too scared to shut them off for more than a moment to check their functioning.

A third of the way through his read, he decided it was time to continue with life and take that garbage out for his mom.  He washed his hands, tossed the magazine on top of the toilet and opened the bathroom door.  Ted stared into nothingness.  Outside of the bathroom there was simply nothing.  An infinite empty void stretched out in front of him.  Horrified, Ted tried screaming - first for his mom, then for anyone.  The blackness swallowed his words.  Ted stretched his arm nervously into the space but could feel nothing.  He grabbed a bar of soap and tossed it out the door as hard as he could.  It fell, fell far into the blank universe and out of sight.  Im dreaming!  I must be dreaming! Ted told himself as he closed the door and cowered in a corner.  He dared not open the door again and look into that terrible space.  Eventually, mind numb with fright, Ted fell asleep.  Early the next morning (though little did Ted realize, time was about to lose all meaning for him) Ted awoke, still curled into a tight ball of fear.  He walked slowly towards the door, rightfully afraid to open it.  When he did, nothing had changed.  The vast emptiness still stood before him, apparently encompassing all of existence except for his bathroom.  He began to scream again, hoping for anyone or anything to hear him, but it was futile.  By the third day, Ted had calmed down enough to find out his new world.  The toilet still worked, as did the sink faucet.  Not caring if he lived or died at this point, Ted drank some of the sink water and found it was quite good.  He also noticed that while he was thirsty, he wasnt ever hungry.  Whether this was permanent or the result of his shock, he wasnt sure.  The lights also worked fine, though Ted was too scared to shut them off for more than a moment to check their functioning.  A week had passed now.  It was confirmed - Ted no longer got hungry.  His thirst could be quenched by drinking from the sink. The toilet still flushed fine and the shower ran and drained properly.  By now, Ted had begun to lose track of time; his main daily activity was to open and close the bathroom door several times throughout the day to see if the normal world would return.  Ted got through his first month fairly easily.  He had started working out every day by doing pushups and situps, leg lifts, planks, and any other exercise he could think of that didnt require weights. Hed read his issue of All About Beer about 100 times and was fairly sick of it.  By the end of his first year, Ted was exhausted.  His life was boring.  All he did was work out, drink water, re-read his issue of All About Beer, and ponder questions about the nature of the universe and reality, as well as daily questions about suicide.  The one thing that kept him from killing himself was the thought that throwing his body into the void may somehow make him an immortal, forever falling into blackness.  He was still aging, that was certain, and he assumed that at least in this bathroom hed eventually die, even if he was raving mad by that time.  After 5 years, Ted decided to see how long he could go without a shower until he was too disgusted with himself to stand it.  He made it 47 days.  After 7 years, Ted finally ran out of toothpaste.  In his eighth year he ran out of interesting things to build with the empty toothpaste boxes and tossed them into the void.  In his tenth year, Ted decided to shave his now massive beard.  He didnt have a razor or shaving cream, so using tweezers he plucked a single hair at a time.  This irritated his skin very quickly, so he had to take many breaks.  The process took 3 days before he was finished.  In his twentieth year, Ted was strong enough to do 2-finger pushups like Bruce Lee.  He was also quite bored with his workout routine.  By his fortieth year in the bathroom, Ted had made friends with the light socket, because it seemed to have a little face.  He called it Socky and had conversations with it every day, going into great detail about the things he would do when he got out of the bathroom, and what the world might be like now.  Finally, at the age of 84, Ted had a heart attack and died.  Ted! shouted his mother from the bottom of the stairs, Youve been in that bathroom for over an hour now!  Are you OK?  When Ted didnt answer, his mom came upstairs to check on him.  Ted? she said outside the door.  When he still didnt answer, she opened the door and screamed.  On the floor was a naked old man.  He was bald and had a long scraggly beard which went down to near his feet.  His mouth was open in a twisted smile, though no teeth remained.  In his hands he clutched a yellowed copy of what looked to be All About Beer magazine.  The man bore a definite resemblance to her son Ted, though even after an extensive police investigation, he was never seen again.
