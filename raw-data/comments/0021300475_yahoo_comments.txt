Luke::Jeff Green has the same illness as Bass and Bynum, they have a touch of the flu and they want to go home to bed. They don't look like they want to play basketball for a living. But on a high note, it took less than ten minutes for Brad to figure out that Olynyk really stinks (regardless of what Tommy Heinsohn thinks) and sit his butt down. Right now they could send a few people to the D-League to eat seafood and win a few games, maybe. Ainge is my Lottery Hero!
scotty::One step closer to a  lottery pick.
LeBlow Job James::What the hell are the Bulls doing? This is supposed to be a tanking year. The Bulls need to be playing for a new franchise player, Jabari Parker. Garf or Pax needs to go down to the side lines and give Thibs a knee lift to the nuts. Why would any Bulls fan want to see them get ousted in the first round of the playoffs? They need to think of the future at this point and get the highest pick possible, preferably lottery.
Supa T::Think Chicago might be surprised with Jeremy Lin when he comes to town. although it would not surprise me if there are other teams that want him.
Michael::What happened to Jeff Green?
Daniel D::The Celtics woulda coulda shoulda season continues. Another game that they looked like they could have won but didn't. I am sure that they will be respectable by the end of the season. Might even make the playoffs.
Commenter::another low scoring game but bulls wins it 89 to 79
Garrett::Flagrant foul my #$%$. League so is soft now it's not even funny.
Michael::Wallace- 1 reb and 1 asst. in 17 minutes.  Is that worth 12 million a year?
FreakinObnoxiousGentile::Dump Green & Bradley , package them for pick.Olynyk & Humphries need more minutes.
