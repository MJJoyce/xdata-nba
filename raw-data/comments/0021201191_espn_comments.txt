pzzldpnthr::Green should be starting.  This might be the line-up to go with the rest of the way.
diehardnr1::GG Boston.....Oust Knicks and Heat please....growing tired of their "fans"
nhraven5200::LOL, Not gonna happen. Knicks in 5.
Tatter2tot::Careful now, never assume something is going to happen just because it happened in the past. Melo and JR aren't just going to gift us a series win, and it's just stupid to think they're just suddenly going to forget how to score because it's the playoffs.
diehardnr1::come on...it IS the Knicks after all....  BOS won more playoff games last year than Knicks have in 10 years... just sayin  Besides, I have watched Melo and JR choke in the playoffs WAY too many times to think they will just magically morph into playoff winners...
BillRussellRulesThemAll_11::Laker fans should learn to be more humble towards the franchise that has kept them behind for countless decades, because it's really sad when you compare the head-to-head records between Boston and LA and see not one advantage to the purple and gold minus the more playoff appearances (which obviously means more attempts to win more chips) and overall franchise winning record. Boston did indeed go through painful years of bad drafting and managing yet they remained atop the rest in chips. And yes the 60's have little teams and was not expanded as now, but what has team expansion done anyway? Teams that have won chips were majorly present during the time the Celtics were hanging banners, they just weren't s. h1t. Lakers, Knicks, Sixers, to name a few have championships and some were won before the ABA/NBA merger. Lakers won 5 chips in Minny and was indeed the first team to win the title, yet that's all they did till winning one 18 years later (yes the Lakers went through a drought too *gasp*). Other than a better franchise winning record over Boston AGAINST THE LEAGUE (not to be confused against the C's themselves) Lakers are and still remain at the bottom under the Celtics' 17. Oh and legitimately won in one city, ALL of them. Not that 5 here 11 there garbage, dumb little blue banner alongside the other 11 ones stating the other victories as saying "hey we have five more but they are not from this city" hahahaha! Stop it LA fans, go and get better at math cuz apparently to you 16 is greater than 17...
schubes05::I bet the Bucks feel like crap for letting Harris go...he's busting out!
..South..Central..Los..Angeles..::Boston fans,  how does it feel leading the league in titles(altho they won all of theirs when they were only like 8 teams and nothing but nerdy white dudes with female shorts) and yet the LAKERS get da most recognition in the NBA and worldwide.We got da most hall of famers,da 2nd best player in history(KOBE),located in Americas jewel,LOS ANGELES,should I continue??U guys aren't even da number 1 known team in ur conference,how sad.
BillRussellRulesThemAll_11::Cocky Laker fans always want to brag about how much relevant their team is and how proudly they rant about their banners when 5 of those were won in Minny, yet they continue to spew nonsense. Statistics of head-to-heads between Celtics and Lakers show the advantage in favor of Boston on regular season records 154 vs 124, winning % of .554 vs .446, playoff records 43 vs 31, winning % of .581 vs .419, the dominant 9-3 head to head in NBA Finals, yet y'all continue to talk petty trash. Though LA has indeed found more recent success let's not forget that Boston had to endure the tragedy of the deaths of both successors post Big 3 of the 80's, plus the bad management did not help. And even after all that downfall Boston stayed ahead of LA in championships and till this very day that remains. So in the meantime it is indeed cute for the little Laker boys to prance around with cockiness but please don't do it against the team that has kept you in second place for countless decades. Jimmy Buss is sure the amazing Gm now isn't he, and you guys can't even make a respectable 8th seed with an All-Star line-up, GTFO with your little ranting and hope your little organization learns how to draft cuz you guys are embarrassing in that and don't talk to me about big FA's cuz you ain't gettin' none in a while. Two more to go champ, then you can shout all that repudiated nonsense you barf out your mouth, or should I say realistically seven more to go! Oh and please retire your boy's Mikans number cuz his name isn't good enough and learn the difference between the back and front of a jersey, number "one" franchise. 17&gt;11 (5)
schubes05::did you forget about 2008? lmao. If KG didnt get hurt in '09 we would have won 3 in a row!
..South..Central..Los..Angeles..::did u forget about 09?? and no I wont type "lol" like a High school teen age girl.If Bynum didn't get hurt in 08 we would have 3 in a row.  Now how da fukkk can u say 3 in a row, when u could only accomplish one title with ur supposedly "big 3"
_I Am A Celtic_::Its sad when morons like this get a hold of a keyboard
schubes05::KG was great in only 19 mins!

Shaun0088::Heat "fans" exist anyways?
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Raptors would have more fans.
THECH0LPATR0L::Heat fans wouldn't exist

UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Keeping the black man down  -Augusta and KKK CEO Fred Ridley
diehardnr1::The penalty was not the problem....even Tiger admits that.   The REAL reason he is in a hole now...is that a perfect shot, for a chance at the solo lead, hit the flag....basically turning a birdie putt into a bogey.  THEN he was so shaken that the rest of the round was mediocre.   The 2 stroke penalty was just rubbing salt in the wound imo  BUT if anybody can come back 4 strokes at Augusta...it is Tiger!
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Tiger Woods was screwed.
Shaun0088::Hockey sucks.
THECH0LPATR0L::yup. The augusta folks aren't too fond of black people. or Blasians.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Fuzzy Zoeller liked your comment.
Kim Jong-Unnihilation::lmao
Kim Jong-Unnihilation::What happened?
diehardnr1::Karma screwed him when the perfect shot hit the flag...but blame everything else by all means...
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::This is according to ESPN. I was working and didn't see so the story could be completely wrong.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::He did it a day before and they said nothing. Go figure. RIGGED
THECH0LPATR0L::he dropped it like a yard behind his divot so the dist would be easier? I don't really get it....

Kim Jong-Unnihilation::hello?
celticsfanbutdonthateme::what up.
Kim Jong-Unnihilation::.........so do you think the c's make it past the first round?
Realityissreality::So celts were 4and 9 in their last 13 but bucks were 3 and 10 . nice attempt to tank so you could pay the heat you pathetic celtics. Cheaters never win though and it isn't work
celticsfanbutdonthateme::WTF r u talking about?
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::What were we going to pay the heat?
Navy Squid45::The Heat will win the championship I don't see anyone beating them in 7 games

Celticpride197::did espn make a mistake and it was LEBRON that tore his achilles
Celticpride197::do you think kareem is toasting to the FACT that Kobe isnt going to surpass him as the all time scoring leader like the 72 dolphins team does every year when the last undefeated team loses
AC130Time1::Watching the re-run of the Reds game, never noticed Choo got hit 6 times by a baseball this season, inaccurate pitchers, smh.
elchupanibre8::LMFAO Knicks will have to beat Boston, Indiana and Miami to reach the finals... We all know thats not gonna happen. Celtics might upset the Knicks in round 1.
ezerick305::"Can't wait to read Jason Terry's diary"    _ no one ever
oblique15::you, since you think about him alot
ezerick305::As much as i hate the Celtics, I actually think that they can pull off a win against the Knicks if they were to face them in the first round. The C's always play hard come playoff time. Even though very few things in the world bring me more joy than to see them go home in the playoffs ringless.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I hate my fellow Reds' fans.
AC130Time1::I'm a Reds fan.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Do you want Dusty fired?
AC130Time1::Celtics either draft Dieng or trade for Vucevic and/or Reggie Evans.
Navy Squid45::You are not getting Vucevic
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Reggie is on a one year deal if memory serves me right.
ezerick305::trade who?
AC130Time1::All I know is if the Celtics get just 2 consistent rebounders and Rondo back, we're dangerous.
schubes05::Maybe if Garnett could go back in time like 5 years, we'd be set.
ezerick305::they would either have to have an awesome draft or they would have to trade rondo to get those 2 consistent rebounders.
AC130Time1::Anyone think this trade would be good? Crawford, Williams, Melo 1st rounder for 1st rounder, Vucevic. Who am I kidding, why would they do this, lol.
Navy Squid45::Magic are not trading again let alone vucevic
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::“I texted Kobe today, I told him I put him in my prayers and I wished him well,” Garnett said. “No one in the world wants to see that happen to a great athlete, great players. I wish him well, man. He’s in my prayers.”  Gotta love KG
ezerick305::how about the time KG told Tim Duncan Happy mothers day while he was on the free throw line even after he knew Duncans mother died when he was a kid..... yeah bro.... gotta love KG
oblique15::THat is during the game, he will say anything during the game not after
chocolate__giddyup::or the dozens of times he's undercut jump shooters trying to break their ankles?
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::just like the entire world bought the honey nut cheerios scenario??? yeahhhhh okay.
ezerick305::Triple Double Stuffed Oreos - he called him cancerous  you bought KG's garbage excuse? wow... looks like you're the gullible one bro... these are just facts.
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::he called him cancerous
ezerick305::Triple Double Stuffed Oreos - lolol  or the time he called charlie villanueva a cancer patient because he has an auto immune skin disease?? oh yeah man.... gotta love KG
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::lolol
ezerick305::Triple Double Stuffed Oreos - how about people being gullible to shxt.  that is a known fact my friend... look it up $@%!.
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::how about people being gullible to shxt.
AC130Time1::Celtics draft: Olynyk, Dieng or Plumlee?
schubes05::Plumlee or Dieng. Somebody who can rebound.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::WCS
AC130Time1::Chances Rondo retires a Celtic?
chocolate__giddyup::He's outta there on the 1st thing smokin when his contract is up. He'll be looking to go to a real contender.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Right. KD will hop on over to Boston when his contract is up because he wants to play with the best. Not a chucker like WB.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::depends how much longer Ainge dangles him as bait. If Ainge if fired, he's a C for life.
AC130Time1::Rondo: Leads NBA in triple-doubles and he hasn't played since January. We'll be good in a few years, maybe not playoffs good in 3-4 years, but just below it. Rondo, Bradley, Green, Sullinger, Draft pick (Plumlee?) would be a great lineup IMO
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::And please don't say Plumlee. Please.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Works for me!
AC130Time1::I don't like Plumlee, I'd rather have Dieng.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Don't forget our addition of Josh Smith.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::He's coming to Boston.
Bhavik3Jain::Nah al Jefferson
AC130Time1::LOL, What?
youll get nothing and like it::knicks in 5 - done
chocolate__giddyup::Wait a minute.... We've got a team in the East playoffs playing 6 games under .500?? Damn shame....
chocolate__giddyup::Probably. But the 2 seed on down would struggle to be the 6th seed playing in the west.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::And yet a team from the East will win the title.
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::Sad injury for Kobe.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Very much so. i actually feel bad for him. Hope he comes back and scores 80 on the Heat next year.
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::same, tough nba season, so many devastating injuries. i'm not looking forward to this year's playoffs to be truthful. Not having Rondo, Rose, or Kobe makes me very sad.
youll get nothing and like it::does garnett sign with miami next year?
micheal3600::only in his dreams
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::KG would rather sign with the Bobcats.

UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I bet you don't hate Bass anymore.
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::lol true

UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Well, he's listed as Day to day.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::But I agree nonetheless.
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::I saw 42 today, you guys should take the time and watch it, good stuff.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::I've been thinking about seeing it. I'll trust your opinion and go.
GodofAcid::I don't care about beating the Knicks. i don't care about beating the Pacers. Hell I don't care about beating the Heat. I want to see the Celtics win another ring.
micheal3600::Celtics win another ring LMAO not any time soon time to rebuild
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::You better start caring about beating those teams then.
GodofAcid::We just saw Kobe rupture his achilles.. things like that happen.. could happen to Lebron, you don't know..
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::The only team we might not face is the Pacers. Other than that, those are the teams we will be facing.
GodofAcid::I don't. If the Bucks upset the Heat, good for the Bucks. It will make the road easier, but it really means nothing. Celts need to win their games, period.
AC130Time1::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFsqtgjVw_4 Wow, awful calls.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::If the C's can build an early decent sized lead, I think we have a shot. If not, we're finished in round one.
schubes05::we'd have a chance if KG could go in the time machine that Duncan uses...
micheal3600::You forgot one thing  Celtics Suck
micheal3600::Hahaha what are you idiots talking about the C's might beat the inconsistent knicks but that's about it. C's will get killed by the Heat, Pacers or Bulls
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::1. The Pacers suck 2. The Bulls aren't much better 3. We probably can't beat the Heat.
Celtics4Life941::knicks will fold in playoffs, like always. C's in 6!
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::i'm very nervous as well UK, this team is just not consistent at all.
youll get nothing and like it::you can't read?
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::you mean the knicks?
youll get nothing and like it::celtics are going nowhere but home.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::Is the word series a consolation prize for having the worst record in MLB?
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::you're clever -said nobody ever
youll get nothing and like it::and the mets might possibly win the world series.
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::the east is weak, if we squeak by New York, all bets are off.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::It's possible.
youll get nothing and like it::celtics to ecf?
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::it will get us damn near close
youll get nothing and like it::and since you don't have that, what will it get you?
Triple Double Stuffed Oreos::Healthy Rondo and Sully gives us an automatic ticket to the ECF's if not further.
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::We are not. But at our best, we can run with the best of teams.
azzyfbaby::if knicks lose this series i will root for celtics to go the whole way like i do every year
micheal3600::Miami walks through the Eastern Conference barring an injury to one of the big 3
azzyfbaby::worse case scenario...brooklyn goes to the finals
youll get nothing and like it::what a ...
azzyfbaby::its better than watching indy or heat win
American League Championship Series 2004::FINALLY a good game, even if it's Orlando...  Also, why's Garnett playing SG?
AC130Time1::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V36qX2_-Ko Proof that the refs hate the Celtics, watch whole video.
chanchoso::dumb
chanchoso::they hate them so much, that they have multiple championships.....
Downtimee::lol
PaulGarnAllen::Knicks might be in trouble here. Yeah they've beaten some odd combination of a wounded Celtics team lately, but in the playoffs I'm not sure they r going to let Melo go off every night. Unless the Knicks are hot from long range every night I think the Celtics can win a tough series
azzyfbaby::i think lol
azzyfbaby::i personally wish that brooklyn squeeze into number 3 spot and let chicago get that 5 seed and let them face the heat face indy or chitown in the second round...and who ever wins the knick celtics series will play either atlanta or brooklyn
youll get nothing and like it::knicks will let melo go off every night - has worked for them so far.  plus they have a "melo" on the bench in smith.  tough team to beat
azzyfbaby::the thing is if u dont double carmelo anthony he will destroy u...if u do double team him he kicks the ball out to our option of shooters...we would have to go completely ice cold in order not to hit them and we been alright all season...plus we got a nice pick and roll going with felton and chandler...hes no rondo but hell hes better than tony douglas or bibby
UK_Basketball_for_Life_BassEdition::The knicks are a much improved team. TBH, I wish we were facing the Pacers in the first round. But I think we can beat them if everyone shows up.
Downtimee::Who will win Knicks or Celtics?
AC130Time1::Celtics in 6.
seansean145::Funny how Garnett and Pierce sat out against the Heat, but played the next game against a horrible Magic team. Celtics don't want any part of the Heat.
chanchoso::was JUST gonna write the same exact thing...
oblique15::funny how Lebron was not gonna play, then he heard KG and PP are not playing and he played
youll get nothing and like it::teams do this all the time - nothing to see here
Kevin Maurice Garnett::I wanted to play but my ankle was sore.
seansean145::Kevin Maurice Garnett - I wanted to play but my ankle was sore.  LOL
PaulGarnAllen::So Shav played 3 minutes while White played 5? I guess that means Shav isn't in the playoff rotation. Seemed like he had done enough but I guess with KG back and Wilcox's experience and athleticism he's odd man out
