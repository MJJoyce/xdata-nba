Curtis::Damian is a superstar, but that doesn't make a champion.  Aldridge, Matthews, and Batum must contribute in order for them to win big.  But, we always did have a problem beating a team with Isaiah Thomas.
clint::42 minutes, really coach?
Devin::Didn't realize that Thornton was starting again.  I wonder if the Kings are trying to showcase him so they can trade him.
Andrew::Still down 10 Aldridge does fine on Offense. His Defense is less than average. Portland is far from a contender until they can defend much better.
Andrew::Thomas Robinson must be in the doghouse. Now Lenard is playing and Barton and are bunch is lacking (again)  Rebounding wins. Barton has zero business playing, his bball IQ is bad, terrible shot selection. Has no idea when to pass or shoot.  Stotts, why are you changing what worked? Robinson, Williams, Freeland, Wright, maybe Lenard at times. Barton gives you nothing.
ThirdyDot::Rudy is a on a mission on this game  and hopefully the rest of the season.
David::Portland is losing cool ...  used to be a hot cake #1 of the West, now the 3rd.  But 5 games away from the 4th place, still safe ... for now.  A really great team is a team that is consistently well performing, like Thunder, Heat, Pacer.   Warriors need to be tested more to confirm.
Professor::As a former coach now analyst of the NBA, I have to say SAC coaches should look at the deep stats.   Look at the +/-.  #$%$ +13, Cousins +7, Thomas -6, Fredette +12.  Look at the PER Player efficiency rating or efficiency per minute of play.
ThirdyDot::Sac should not 'play not to lose' this 4th quarter and stay aggressive offensively and being smart defensively as well.
Andrew::Send a memo to Teri Stotts Defense and Rebounding wins in the long run. Play the lineups that provide that Terrance.
