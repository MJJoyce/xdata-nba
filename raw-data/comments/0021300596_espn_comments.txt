Nick Mann::Remember when Philly started 3-0 with wins over Chicago and Miami...and they were the team to beat according to ESPN?    Ah I love ESPN and other idiot analysts affiliated with the league.
Trevor Hennington::Settle down, nobody thought they were the team to beat.  Even ESPN said the sixers will regress, and they did.
Kevin Valdez::the team to beat? no one said that espn had them ranked last before the season since we're tanking.
Sean Rhodes::Two struggling teams, disappointing seasons, hopefully the Bulls get it going.  See Red!
Jacob Mellor::Anybody know anything about Tornike Shengelia? Looks like he's coming to Chicago for Marquis Teague.
Robert Janousek::It's a salary dump.  He was the 5th pick out of 60 a few years ago and his contract expires after this year.
Jorge Fornes::Philly is.getting disrespected right now
Bobby Richardson::Butler chucking up way to many 3's this year
Raegon Gallant::Get rid of Cartier Martin please lol
Jo Neyens::Any chance Sixers come back to 10 points?
