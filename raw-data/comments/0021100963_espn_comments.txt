charlesshumway1962::I’ve been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 3 months straight now following this system. I found this system by Google searching the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for  anyone that is looking for a system that actually works and is tired of not winning your bets like I once was

DrewThomas3030::Toronto, Toronto, give it up already. Sell your team.
RaptorsJaysGiants::troll
screwhead2305::so whats next for the bucks??? what position is the greatest need?? cause i dont see a Center on your roster i would think that could be an area to focus on
-FEARTHEDEER-::center/sf but mainly center
Paddywaggie::See you next season boys
squidward tennis_balls::bye Milwaukee bucks enjoy your time fishing.

TYLILMAX::11-14-24-56-9 oops !! wrong lottery
kobe bryant is assaulting the lakers salary cap::i prefer trolling cleveland forums. ask them why they didnt resign lebron
losdog1118::knicks are pretenders, but sixers match up with bulls maybe a memphis san antonio from last year..banged up rose, both teams play great defense...this smells of a upset...
losdog1118::I am glad bucks are NOT in playoffs...milwaukee loves that 8th spot..one and done.. I am sick o fit and now they can add thru lottery some more talent..knicks will get beat down by heat..sixers may upset bulls...fire skiles and let hammond walk, rebuild thru draft and see if you can keep brandon and ellis together with some of the bench guys..need a 3 and another big
winfield47::tanking a game with back-ups is fine by me. surprised how close they kept in Milwaukee. The Bucks need a lot of improvements to be playoff calibur.
winfield47::Honestly, the 76ers, Knicks, Hawks, and Magic aren't that impressive. I wouldn't be surprised if 3 of them arent in the playoffs next year. I think a healthy Raptors team next season can compete w/ any of them.
dk 57::i would have rather seen them in the playoffs than not.  the difference between having one of the bottom records in the playoffs and one of the top records outside of the payoffs only amounts to a couple of spots in the draft, unless of course they get inside of the top 3 which isnt real likely based on their record.
losdog1118::bucks are right there...they need a three and one more big...theres hope in the draft that can push us up to 6th or higher in the east but they need a big either at 3 or 4 immediately...I am glad they are not the 8th spot
TYLILMAX::Anybody up for a game of ping pong?
kobe bryant is assaulting the lakers salary cap::Tyson Chandler will have a career ending injury. Amare is 100 million worth of broken crap. Anthony is a fat ass
TYLILMAX::hahaah
TYLILMAX::The buck stops here---&gt; GO KNICKS!!!!!!!!!
dk 57::i hate the heat, but give it a few weeks and so will the knicks
buckspackers23::And don't care.
TYLILMAX::Tyson chandler&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The heat
buckspackers23::Don't care.
kobe bryant is assaulting the lakers salary cap::i wish the bucks had made it. i hate the overpaid knicks. i hope amare breaks his knees and dies. seriously.
springfresh33::yikes
bw092892::let's go bucks! 2013 nba champs!
kobe bryant is assaulting the lakers salary cap::i feel sorry for who ever has to pay ersan whateveryoucallhim
dk 57::hopefully a small enough contract so milwaukee can get him back.
buckspackers23::He's going to get a shit ton this summer.
-FEARTHEDEER-::Go Pacers, Hawks, Grizzlies, and Utah/Suns
DeerandBeer91::im rooting for the Bulls and spurs..Chicago is like a second home to a lot of people in Milwaukee
Submerge25::Not at all.
WiscCHISportsFan12::Go everyone but the Knicks and the LA teams.
buckspackers23::Except Ramon Sessions, wish that guy the best.
WiscCHISportsFan12::Yes. Ramon is a boss. Too bad he is on such a scumbag filled team.
RaptorsJaysGiants::I think you Buck fans should respect the Knicks
-FEARTHEDEER-::I can't respect fans if they don't know how to spell
buckspackers23::Or, the Pacers. I can't respect a big market team that barely makes the playoffs with multiple huge contracts and has an army of bandwagon trolls.
WiscCHISportsFan12::Couldn't agree more. Go Pacers!
TYLILMAX::lebron cant guard melo
DeerandBeer91::melo cant guard LeBron
DeerandBeer91::Harrison Barnes has huge Bust potential
RaptorsJaysGiants::He will be a solid player tho
torontoraps054::that's perry jones...
DeerandBeer91::both and andre drummond
buckspackers23::Go Bucks... next season!   Go Pacers and Suns!
-FEARTHEDEER-::And Grizzlies!
buckspackers23::Going for the Pacers because they're succeeding as a small market.
RaptorsJaysGiants::y arent u rooting for the knicks?
knicks_11::because were aswesome and u  arent.
kingshovel::Clown College&gt;Canada
GSC72::What happened to gooden
jamesbik::Bucks players next year $45 million in salaries....future not so bright Larry Sanders - Terrible (like a young dan gadzuric) Monta Ellis -  inconsistent player who put up stats on bad teams  Drew Gooden - 3 years left on his horrible contract  Brandon Jennings - Shoot first point guard who can't shoot Tobias Harris - Only 19 could be a good player Luc Mbah a Moute &amp; Ekpe Udoh - Good Defense zero offense Mike Dunleavy - Just a guy
bmorenevermore::wtf happened to jon leuer? he was doing solid in whatever little pt he go.
dk 57::it all hinges on being able to lock some of that young talent up long term.  need a true  big which looks like a combination of sanders and udoh just might work with more experience.
jamesbik::And they need a superstar guy....right now they have a bunch of role players like every year
DeerandBeer91::im done bye
DeerandBeer91::you dont hop into the nba dominating..unless you are KD35 or russel westbrook
jamesbik::Crazy young means nothing if the players arent good....the bobcats are crazy young too
DeerandBeer91::but the bobcats got last place..the bucks almost made the playoffs
jamesbik::Potential just means you haven't done anything
DeerandBeer91::we are crazy young!!of course we havent done anything
-FEARTHEDEER-::Larry Sanders - tons of potential Monta Ellis - 4 30+ games for milwaukee Drew Gooden - couldn't agree with you more BJ3 - averaging 21 points last 8 games and tries more than anyone else on the team Harris - whatever Luc and Udoh - Both have improved on offense greatly especially around the board Dunleavy - GREAT bench player who is incredible from 3pt line You sir are wrong
jamesbik::its a horrible team
DeerandBeer91::ugh..where do i start
buckspackers23::Gooden is gone, Udoh has some offense, Sanders has potential, Jennings improved a lot, Harris does have a bunch of potential, Ellis is inconsistent, and Dunleavy puts up some nice stat lines.
RaptorsJaysGiants::Good tank job Raps :) Harrison Barnes 2012.
torontoraps054::Golden state fan= owned
TYLILMAX::Recruiting heat haters for the playoffs GO KNICKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-FEARTHEDEER-::I'm officially a pacers fan and really anyone but the knicks.
knicks_11::ooh... i wonder who talks about the pacers.. alot.. No One.
joshklann::true haha
WiscCHISportsFan12::You should be recruiting God. He may be the only one that can help the Knicks beat the Heat.
WiscCHISportsFan12::That doesn't mean much when the other team has LeBron.
knicks_11::or we already have a gift, the best scorer in the league In Melo.
buckspackers23::I like the Heat more than Knicks' douchebags.
knicks_11::thanks ;)
buckspackers23::^Sorry, you're out numbered by your trolls.
knicks_11::Hey Hey!
RiotVAN2012::Toronto Bostriches
WiscCHISportsFan12::Off topic, but it is good to see the Saints franchise go down the toilet. Poor Drew Brees.

knicks_11::we made the playofffs.
WiscCHISportsFan12::You seem suprised?
bmorenevermore::It would've been embarrassing for you if you didn't with all the money you spent.

torontoraps054::Bucks our my fav team after the raps If it wasn't for the bucks we would have never gotten Harrison barnes..  Thank you Milwaukee
korn7860::Remind me why you will get Harrison Barnes, you could get as high as 1st, I would be aiming or Beal or Robinson as a Raptor fan, they will be the studs of this draft.
