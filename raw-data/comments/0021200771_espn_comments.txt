Steve74811::Started betting with a system called SportsBettingStar now for a couple of months.  I found this on the first page of Google by looking up Sports Betting Systems.
jg181837::I was at the game courtside and cousins whined  literally from start to finish he is a punk
Kpmg allstar::No Jimmer?  Sorry Memphis fans, you wasted your money
machinegunkelley80::All UK guys talking about cousins complaining should consider the fact that it's a good thing.  It means he wants to win. If a person takes his lumps without standing up for themselves then you should worry
gw687::If you watch Cousins regularly, he isn't complaining about calls or wanting to win.  He is complaining he doesn't get do whatever he wants on the court.  He is whining he doesn't get the ball every possession.  He is whining about having to work to actually become a good NBA player.  Cousins is ridiculous.  He is absolutely one of these young, gifted players who seems destined to career underachieve because he can't get over himself and has 0 work ethic.  I went to the Nuggets game 3 weeks ago and watched him stand on the court for 4 straight possessions.  Literally he stood at the elbow on one side of the court.  Didn't run back on D, didn't move on O, just sat there and stared at the other 9 players play basketball.  I am not even exaggerating, 4 possessions (2 Denver, 2 Sac), didn't move a foot.
doof54::?? UK guys ?? I think not.  Pouting and sulking are your idea of someone standing up for themselves ??
machinegunkelley80::Autocorrect on my phone, so a guy complaining about a call on a losing team is immature?  Wanting to win is complaining?  You sideline experts kill me
jg181837::Cousins should play for the spurs as much as he whines
doof54::DeMarcus Cousins is a baby and a mental midget, rivaled only by D-Ho out in LOLakerLand.  Wastes so much time pouting, sulking, complaining...
dog_has_fleas::He is a kid that has had everything given to him since he was in AAU. Can you really blame him solely for the way him and many other young players don't develop as people?
dog_has_fleas::doof54 - I can now that he is supposedly a man. Time to grow up...  It will probably continue for a couple years unless he gets pushed out of basketball altogether. Some people grow up at different rates and the way athletes are now I am not surprised that kids are like this.
doof54::I can now that he is supposedly a man.  Time to grow up...
jg181837::Jimmer is good but he doesn't play because he does not have a defensive bone in his body go grizz
Bubba 7222::No NBA player has a defensive bone in his body. The rules are set up for scoring and Jimmer can do that as well as anyone. Crying shame that Sac has good players sitting while below average stiffs are playing. James Johnson is an athletic freak who can't get on the floor. Come on man!
WatergateSwag III::LEBRON JAMES, THABO STEFOLOSHA, TYSON CHANDLER, LARRY SANDERS, SERGE IBAKA CHRIS SINGLETON, TONY ALLEN, ANDRE IGUODOLA,   HAVE YOU NOT HEARD OF THESE DEFENSIVE PRESENCES?
jg181837::Understand didn't really care about til the grizz got here
jg181837::I do think they should get a point guard over 5'9 that would help
dog_has_fleas::Like I said, IT can be explosive and kill some guys, just other games he doesn't do so well. All I do know is if they do move, I will no longer have a favorite team. I will still watch the NBA but won't have much reason to buy anything as it will have nothing to appeal to me.
dog_has_fleas::I don't think he has an issue with it but with IT/Bizarro IT playing point it is hard to unseat him. He will have a huge game and then follow it up with a few stinkers. Add that to the fact that Sacramento has the weirdest coach when it comes to playing bench guys. Jimmer should get run over Brooks in my opinion.
jg181837::Jimmer should learn how to play the point
dog_has_fleas::I don't know if it is that he has NO DEFENSE, it is just that he has some work to do. Still don't see that as a reason for a DNP when they play Aaron Brooks.
dog_has_fleas::This is really the one time I can advocate for fans of Jimmer as they are clearly not fans of the team but I was fine when Jimmer was getting Brooks minutes. 20 minutes a game isn't bad and THIS TIME, Brooks had a good game but why not look into playing Jimmer over him?   I laugh at those who think it is race related as it really is just a cop out. No one here knows why other than Smart is maybe the weirdest lineup guy in the league. I mean he played Biedrins and Radmonovic, he also played David Lee and Louis Amundson along with the other two the next year. The fact is the Kings team is all black but one player and because he doesn't play him people look at it as racism. Wake up people, he might be dumb but he isn't a racist.
pastelpaul::Austin Daye looks great with the Griz. He's a tall guy that can shoot and they need a guy like that. Makes the Rudy Gay deal look alot better.
Jumeax::This shouldnt be a Shock he was shooting 53% from deep for the Pistons, but small usage, average 1 make from less than 2 attempts
pastelpaul::that inside out strategy works really well in opening up the floor for other players. You can see that Dwight H is not comfortable outside of that system in LA. He gets the ball and they swarm him and they don't have those kind of shooters there. He's not good with the DAntoni system at this point and the other players aren't either.
dog_has_fleas::They should have tried to nab Shannon Brown in the Nash trade. Guy doesn't play in PHX, would just make sense.
pastelpaul::it was a salary dump, but Daye really seem to fit with the team. They are more dangerous with a guy who can hit the open three and the offense seems more fluid and open than with Rudy in there.
dog_has_fleas::I think it was because they expected Gay to score more with the huge contract he had. Now they pound it inside and then toss it outside to Allen and Daye to hit the three. Sort of the way the Orlando team that went to the Finals a few years ago.
dog_has_fleas::I think getting rid of Rudy gay made the deal look good. Whatever they got back in return I imagine just came as a bonus to them.
Jumeax::doghasfleas, But they ended up with a better team, even if you don't count the huge finanical benefit/bonus  its not just a bonus comapred to amnestying gay and getting no one, Tayshaun, daye, davis &gt; Gay  on what they contribute on court this season
doof54::Contract albatross - true that.  Basketball albatross - iso ballstopper, hero-ball, high-volume shooter / low percentage scorer, regular 3 for 17 with an occasional good game like last night.
dog_has_fleas::doof54 - Tayshaun, Daye, Ed Davis, 7.5 mil trade exception, 6 mil space under the cap vs. 4.5 mil over...  Like I said, anything they got back was just a bonus for getting rid of the albatross of a contract.
doof54::Tayshaun, Daye, Ed Davis, 7.5 mil trade exception, 6 mil space under the cap vs. 4.5 mil over...
doof54::Thanks Rudy. Purreciate you guys beating the Nuggs.
blackdevilace::Come on Sonics you can do better than that stop trying to win, keep losing so we get that #1 pick!! :P
espnfirsttimer12::sacramento black panthers...its as simple as that... every time this disgusting team takes the floor its the equivalent of a panther pride rally... Only one player cont to have no reward system for his excellent play... while others (aka one ball hog extraordinaire marcus thorton gets to tell keith not so smart when they want to check in the game lol.... then go 4 for 18 and be rewarded with more min... meanwhile fredette to games ago vs utah came in for 8 min in the sec quarter and scored 7 points on 3 for 4 shooting... dished out 3 assist.. grabbed 2 rebounds.. and had a steal for good measure... this production came as jimmer was running the point.... how was he rewarded come second half... he played 2 min and 35 sec... and heres the kicker... he played as the two guard.... this is the norm treatment with fredette.... and no one in sac even raises an eyebrow due to either ignorance or the fact that no one care two cents for the kings organization... nevertheless,  i have never seen in all my years of watching nba basketball a team alienate a young talent, like this team has done fredette..... for the first two months of the season fredette was in the top 5 in points per 48 min.... top five..... this was rewarded (on a last place team i mind u) with absolutely no increase in minutes..... fredette has been the nba's #1 ft shooter all year long, top ten 3 point % all year.... and as of tonight, his racist coach still is hitting him with DNP's... you say fredettte will probably never be a star.... i say we will never know unless someone does the right thing and gets him the heck away from this hate monger of a coach....

cougarblitz::Keith Smart is a compete idiot. He deserves every loss he gets! Why he continues to hold on to a coaching job defies all common sense? Jimmer on the bench..DNP coach's decision? Cmon!!!
memphis 95::Im sure the timberwolves would take him and play him, they have a thing for white players, it'd be a perfect fit.
memphis 95::Who would trade Randolph for a healthy k love? If not, why? And if so, why?
gw687::Randolph for a healthy K Love, is a no brainer.  T Wolves would lose that deal though, and the Grizz would too when he leaves for a "big market" team next summer.
memphis 95::K love is Randolph's white twin, he can have a 20/20 almost every other game. Plus he's younger and he can shoot better.
david.smith811::no, because i'm not dumb.
philweilert::i dont get why Thomas Robinson isnt getting playing time. I dont get to see any of the kings games so maybe someone out west can help explain a little bit
gw687::Because of the way he is when he does get PT.  He has a tendency to "dribble quest" when he is on the court.  I think he is suffering form low minutes so when he does get on the court he is shooting it every time he touches it, not living in the post, rebounding, and making a living like the Kings would prefer.  He also plays on the most selfish team in the NBA, meaning he is being dragged down rather than getting better.
philweilert::ok thanks because everything i read before the season it sounded like he was going to start and was coming along really well and then he just hasn't played they made it sound
sklater::Their records are almost polar opposites of each other.
Soul_Sonic_Force_2::Go Memphis!!!!  Peace, Love and Grind
johnholmes6969::I feel like memphis is a very scary team!!!!
memphis 95::I can't wait till we go against Rudy gay next week with the comments saying his team mates in Memphis didn't trust in him, should be a really good game for the grizzlies. GnG.
MemphisTn7414::Go Grizzlies!!!
pismohoops::Fire Keith Smart!!!!!
DDMaclin::Who loved that dunk by Tony Allen?
DDMaclin::lol true...TA has stepped up a lot with his offensive game he is no longer a liability. If only he had a shot outside the three point line. Can't down the Grind Father a.k.a Mr North Memphis...Great game for him
emthomasjr::It was ridiculous in person.  I've seen him completely blow much easier dunks, which made it all the more amazing!  LOL.
emthomasjr::How many turnovers in the 4th quarter?  Yet the game never really seemed like it was out of control.  We are coming around.  This is a good stretch of games to get guys on the same page, and while there have been some pretty ugly spots, it looks like things are headed in the right direction.
Italics87::Coach Smart's name is the biggest oxymoron I've ever seen
nlwhittle::Keith Smart would single handedly coach the Heat into a bottom feeder!  If he were Michael Jordan's coach, he would have found a way to destroy that dynasty as well.  Give him a team like my Kings and you know we're screwed night in and night out!  I read people posting "free Jimmer", butI think we all should be posting Free Sacramento Kings Fans!  Dump Smart!
cougarblitz::Jimmer DNP tonight...Coach's Decision....King's lose by 6 and needing some quick points from Beyond the Arc in the 4th and Jimmer on the bench with a DNP???? WAKE UP SMART (or we should call him Keith Stupid)!!!!

123cityboy::Free Jimmer! Go Jazz lol

jack nelson 888::go cougars..
machinegunkelley80::I like the Daye kid,  he can score. Davis needs to bulk up a bit
memphis 95::He must've grown since the last time you played him because his player profile says he's 6'6
emthomasjr::I saw him at Lifetime the other day; he's definitely taller than 6'3" and if he's 6'4", he's a pretty tall 6'4".
memphis 95::Wroten has a really good upside being a 6'6 PG with great athleticism he just needs to develop a jump shot and he'll be set
TWolveRidnourYankeeZagSeahawkFan13::Yeah cuz kids don't grow in college...
jack nelson 888::Wroten isn't 6'6.. Ive played against him before in highschool ball. he's like a 6'3 or 6'4. Still has great upside though
memphis 95::He just needs more minutes he was a beast in Toronto, hollins don't need to bench him like they did hamed and like he does luer
machinegunkelley80::Not big on either of them,  I'd rather see wrotten get more burn
roy2daboy::Good win for the Grizz.  Now go into hibernation mode, get plenty of rest, and prep for next Tuesday fellas.
GoTigers2015::Rudy Gay's clutch game-winning shots make me disappoint  :(, anyways good game, Daye is a great shooter, I want more Ed Davis minutes, he looked good when he was out there (6 minutes). Tony Allen was a beast, that dunk was sick, Marc Gasol - please play like that from now on, don't be so unselfish
emthomasjr::Heck naw - vs. all of the West Coast teams, he needs to keep knocking those down!  Great assist from Rudy for the Grizzlies!
memphis 95::It actually helped the grizzlies out by moving farther up in the playoff race with Denver and the warriors with gays clutch shot
kcisney BYU::I know Kings fans get annoyed with Jimmer fans, but really... they should just trade him already. It's not like they're going to give him a shot. Let him play for 20 consistent minutes for a whole regular season before you give up on a 1st round pick. Or trade him to a team that will. Just my observation.
espnfirsttimer12::oh they wont trade him... they sign his extension.... then wont play him.... they like making sure he doesnt have a chance to make a splash smh... its like nothing ive ever seen in all my years of watching sports...
espnfirsttimer12::amen... and please dont be an apologist for this pathetic fan base... they dont care two cent what u think of them so dont be worried about what they think of you.... they cant even keep their franchise.. they don't even make a fuss that fredette has been treated so raw... funny thing is, even tho they wont play him, they have to pick up his option because if he walks, half their fan base walks as well.. heres hoping that seattle fans are smart enough to demand when a lottery/national poy starts the first two months of the season in the top five in points per min, that that player receive more min.... not less
GoTigers2015::Jimmer to Memphis please, thanks - need a shooter like him
memphis 95::He wouldn't get no pt in Memphis with the way hollins coaches, but he is a great shooter though.
1grizzfan4life::Great game Grizzlies! Way to head into the All-Star break! GNG!
Everyday im Shufflin 290::3 wins and a row heading to the All Star break will take it
Workaholic828::i hate how DMC is portrayed as a player with maturity problems. He is a winning player that is on a team that loses every single game. He gets bashed for hating on keith smart and his other former coach when half of the kings fans on here agree with him that his coaches so far have sucked. if they can start winning the maturity problems will go away.
espnfirsttimer12::l m a o... BOOGIE'S A CLASS ACT UR EXACTLY RIGHT.... I HOPE AMERICAS YOUTH IS LOOKING TO HIM AS A PRIMARY EXAMPLE
Workaholic828::the only flaw with his attitude is that he hates losing. he argues for calls all of the time because hes competitive and doesnt like to lose. i agree a good veteran player would be very helpful for him
Eric Forman.::He's a heck of a player but he has attitude issues. I just wish he could get a solid veteran teammate who he could look up to and learn from.
Chapmanx23::Seems like he's Pouting like a baby to me.
danjorams::winning can solve a lot of problems but it is how you react to adversity that shows maturity.  I agree he would be an allstar on a winning team
braineater000::He's a nut-job.  Get over it.
Chapmanx23::Another solid performance for John Salmons. 30 min, 1-5 FG, 0-3 3p, 2 Points. Coach Smart sees nothing wrong with this apparently.
braineater000::Coach Smart sees nothing.
stephenson1mattbyu::Wow did he really play 30 mins? It felt like he played 5 minutes. He really was non-exsistent  tonight
Chapmanx23::He's Tyreke Evans shadow.
danjorams::king James has retooled his game to taking less outside jumpers.  He isdoing things that are just amazing...fun to watch
rc021363::He is on fire, don't think anyone can stop the Heat right now.
danjorams::I agree...it will be tough.   I can't wait to see what he does next and to see if he can keep this up.  I think he could average 40/ game if he took 20 25 shots a game.
Chapmanx23::False.
