it is what it is::Does anyone else feel that Stephenson is the Pacers' MVP?  He is a triple double waiting to happen in any game.  Not only that, he sat out against the Hawks and the Pacers were totally out of sync and got embarrassed.  Granger will NEVER get to start again as long as Lance stays healthy.  On a side note:  I wish he (Lance) would cut down just a bit on the showboating.  "Dude, the fans are smart enough to know how good you are and when you make a fantastic play.  You don't need to draw extra attention to yourself.  They see what you do and can do".  David West may be the "leader" of this team, but Lance Stephenson is the "engine" that makes it run.
FeliciaM::66 points scored by an NBA team. Pathetic.
Michael::This game shows at least Paul George can swallow his pride on a bad shooting day and find other ways to contribute...13 boards and 5 assists...
yahoo user::really John Wall 1 for 6 in the 1st qt,with that sorry as jump shoot, he need to go to the rim or pass the ball, but right now he is on the bench, A very good place for him.
Francis::Pacers are playing great defense.
Commenter::indiana for the win babby
Kadak_Chai::Hibbert needs to work on his offense. He's an outstanding defender; however, if you want to go to the next level, improve your postgame/ jumpshot.   GO PACERS
Fernando::George goes for 2-14 and Granger 1-7 but they won with a lead of 27 points. That tells you a lot about how good they are. Miami fans must be p!"ss"ing  in their panties
Diony::Let's Go Pacers !!!
Naturally Tanned Man::i know pacers have great defense but wow wiz cant score if their life depended on it
