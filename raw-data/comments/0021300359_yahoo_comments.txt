Donald::I did not know that Michael Carter-Williams had a skin infection.  I wonder what happened to him.
Sbin Nibs::35 assists is pretty good but I guess not so difficult when the team shoots 60% 3 pointers and 60% 3-pointers.
Peter::76ers should just forfeit the rest of the season. Their body language already shows that. Absolutely NO defense whatsoever. Worst team in the NBA.
NBA Man::PKM, no one plans for the 7th seed, you moron. Why not get the first seed, they get the second, and you don't have to play them till the conference finals?
Ali::Remind me why I dropped Joe Johnson on my fantasy team -__-
Guest::Wish MCW would get back on the court. He is going to miss out on Rookie of the year with this knee problem. Too bad, that kid was looking good.
PKM::Nets want the 7th seed so they can play the Heat in the first round.  Heat can't match up against Brook.
chuck d::Hawes gets 4 shots , guess the players run the team not the coach.
Peter::Nets       minus Kidd      equals       success
michael::That's good that the nets r getting the games together on a winning streak and I'm happy for them, okay now keep it up!!!!
