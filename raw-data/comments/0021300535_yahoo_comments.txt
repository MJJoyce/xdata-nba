clint::Ben Gordon, has he been working on his game, because I can't remember the last time he was a productive player.
dealwithit::Another wolves blow out, another shot at getting past 500 awaits them in San Antonio.  Anyone want to be bet they lose a close one and go sub 500 again?
elemental1::As usual you know nothing, Turd (a.k.a. Davey Crocket, South Park, Bob, Greg, Barney, Michael Scott). You especially have no idea what it is like to be a fan of the Wolves since you are NOT a fan. All you do is troll and hate.
El Jefe MN::Wolves have no attitude or "killer" instinct....too nice.  Maybe this KLove thing will kick them in the #$%$ and get them to start playing with a bit of a chip on their shoulders.  Just once I would like to see a "tough" foul when those opposing guards come down the lane.  Got to send a message at some point.
brett::Scrubs will win, the big question is which scrubs There's a Youtube vid called MIND BENDING THUMB BENDING where Kevin Love says his father, a backup singer for the Beach Boys who didn't write any songs, is more talented than he is.
whoaaa::I want the T-Wolves in the playoffs.  This team just needs toughness.  Its certainly skilled enough.  They need to trade for a player that isn't necessarily good, but just crazy and tough.  A Reggie Evans type player, just plays hard and is tough.
PKM::Twolves can't string wins together.
jailere::Wow only 3 teams in the East over .500 and we are worried about the Wolves being a troubled team.
Ray::Rubio might be the worst shooting guard in nba history, smh...dude cant find the basket.
Michael::Looking forward to seeing big al jefferson at target center  he is a double double machine, and was big part of kg trade in '07
