Steve B::This was the most exciting game they played all year and against the one team whose long time rivalry they  have seems to give them that emotion that drive to win as the Lakers hate those Celtics .These once 2 mighty NBA teams will one day return as the best of the best .The question is when
Chia X::See, Marshall is such a turnover machine but nevertheless Lakers are committed to him. Not a lot of point guards get that much tries.
Hair Club Dooley::I feel much more secure wearing this adult diaper.
Michael::The Celtics are clueless and so is the coach.  Rondo is being showcased for a trade by Tank Commander Danny.
Denis D::Bradley killed them in this game,my grandmother could have done a better job putting the ball in the hole.
Larry::Are they really the Dooley maniacs?
bob Z::Big free throw difference.
righteousaurus::You know...even though both these teams stink this year, it still is overly satisfying to see the Lakers beat the Celtics.
Phillip::Both teams are tanking for the lottery.
The Most Interesting Man in the World::This one hurts a lot.  With Rondo back, coming off our first win in forever, our biggest rival the Lakers in town.  And to just let this D league team outplay us on our home court is embarrassing.  We FOLDED up and did not score or defend the last 5 minutes and coughed up a nice lead AGAIN.  And holy #$%$, hire an assistant coach who understands rotations and perimeter D already.  This is getting old quick.  But I'm glad Rondo is back.  At least there's that.
