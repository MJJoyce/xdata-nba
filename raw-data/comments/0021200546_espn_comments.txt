Joey White25::Derrick Rose = Brandon Roy
DBrownDrose::this an easy fix up GO BULLS
raidertatonmyarm2::yea man and shuperts playing this week why isnt rose playing already im sure he rehabbed harder and stronger and longer then anybody... given his track recrods and what all the coachs and players say about him and the fact that oj mayo and westbrook wanna work out with him in the offseason
DBrownDrose::hes not playing yet cause hes the face of the franchise, bulls management dont want to rush him too fast
chicityflyer87::I think 98% of the miami heat fan base live somewhere in middle america and work at burger king thoughts?
DBrownDrose::or live in cuba

nonaligned::its almost as if the bulls are missing a key player or something....
winfieldbus::bulls, why are you so sad at home?
CandySparker:::);)
562-bell gardens::CP3&gt;DRAGIC CP3&gt;DGLASS
CHITOWNBULLS1991::The Bulls should try to work out a trade with either the Orlando Magic for J.J Redick, or the Charlotte Bobcats for Ben Gordon. We need more scoring.
arizonasportsman::Truth is, any team can be beaten by any team on a given night.
Arbyrick::Exactly, thats why betting on NBA games is amazingly difficult!
Jesse07771::Comment of the night
miamiheatnotsosweet::what the H is wrong with this team - beat great teams and lose to the bums?
supe540::What?  Bulls are 12 - 3 against weak teams and 8 - 12 against good teams.  What have you been watching?
nba is the worst::13-3 and 7-12 vs .500 and above as of this morning: http://espn.go.com/nba/standings/_/type/expanded
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::hard to watch but think of it this way the bad teams won't be in the playoffs
matthughesprospect::D Rose and Dominated, shutup, you're an embarassement to all Chicagoans. Chalmers, What does MJ's personal life have anything to do with how he beasted everyone with ease for pretty much every year he was in the league? Do you know why he's the GOAT? You can say, "well Bill Russell has more championships, and Kareem has more total points, and the Big O was the most effecient and Wilt Chamberlain was the most dominant force". Yeah, well, you need ALL those people to put up against Jordan. He did it all at the perfect time and took the world by storm. It is what it is. LeBron passes up final shots, Michael accepted nothing less than being the one to take it, that's what seperates them, not skills or strengths or lack thereof, or their teammates or how LeBron had to run like a sour puss to Miami to win his coveted ring. Mike earned it, LeBron bought it. That being said, LeBron is definitely in my all time top 10. DUDE CAN HOOP!
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::calm down dude just trying to flush out the trolls that were in here infecting every comment with garbage
superman253540::Fact:  Chris Bosh before basketball worked in a chocolate factory packing fudge.
superman253540::Well he is going back to his old profession the minute he is retired from the NBA
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::i didn't know it was legal to hire dinosaurs
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::tough game monday atl always gives us problems
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Ight well im out Peace out Bulls fans, Bulls will definitely bounce back.  GO BULLS!
Smokez4Dayz718::3rd time you beat the knicks and lose the next night. trying real hard vs the knicks, huh?
KnickshaterfromNY::Of course they'll bounce back, just need the knicks on their schedule
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::peace dude im sure we will chat again
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::.
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::nailed it
superman253540::Define childish.  Is it making fun of a player getting injured?
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::well I don't make childish remarks like killing myself
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::no just childish remarks through out the rest of your life
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo1UlzDeY-o  HAHAHAHA
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::that is giving h.omo's a bad name
superman253540::cHeat fans=homos
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Karma is a B!!TCH ill tell you that loser
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::What makes LeBron better than Jordan? His unselfishness, his smile, his humbleness, he didn't get cut from his high school team (LMFAO). Off the court, LeBron helped kids learn how to read, write, and do math  Jordan cheated, gambled, divorced, smoked, drank.. did crazy stuff.
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::.
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::.
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::What is it with Chicagoans obsession with murder?
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::flagged for threat
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::with all that bad karma the heat fans are throwing around it won't be long till something happens to there team
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Well we already know they are going to suck a$$$ after next season
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::true true
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Miami Heat fans: Established in July 2010
Kreator78::Your sense of humor has yet to be established.
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::this mario chalmers is a complete ball licker
superman253540::@ D. Rose I just couldnt tell. Carry on
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::Don't you dare speak about Rose's Daddy like that.
superman253540::The real 1 or the one on this board?
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::both
TheReturnOfNumber1::Tough loss for the Bulls, but I'm confident they'll bounce back on Monday. G'night everybody.  Go Bulls!
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::and don't let the door hit you on the way out BIOJ! haha
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::I don't even think any of these Heat trolls in here are actually Heat fans. They are probably Knick or Celtics fans on secret accounts trying to get entertainment lol
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::hahahaha
heat nation toronto::I'm a die hard heat fan since 2010, at least I'm honest
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::well when michael and the boys won ther last title i was 16 and enjoying every minuite
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::You better hope someone invents a Time Machine because that's the only way the Bulls will win another.
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::Guess what Bulls Nation!  JORDAN SUCKED! THE GUY CHEATED AND WON 6 RIGGED TITLES. LMFAO! Gotta love how those refs got hard for Jordan every time he went to the basket
superman253540::Hey Chalmers, u really wanna talk about rigged titles as a cHeat fan?
TheReturnOfNumber1::If Jordan won 6 rigged titles, then the Heat have 0 non-rigged titles in their franchise history.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::LMAO
heat nation toronto::Been a heat fan since bosh joined the team.... # loyal to former players
TheReturnOfNumber1::You basically represent 80% of the Heat's fanbase.
heat nation toronto::I don't care.... Heat is in my blood now
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::lol
I Took Passing Lessons from Kobe::Im out Most of these Bulls fans were 5 when Jordan won his 6th ring anyway. I feel bad for them. They've never really experienced winning a championship in their lives. They'll choke once again this year. They lost to the bobcats and suns AT HOME LMFAO, yet they still rely on the overrated Rose to save them. Rose is nothing if he plays a good defender like LeBron, look how that turned out. He got shut down.  See ya Bulls fans lololol have fun being the usual losers yall are.
bycrackyrules77::idiot!!!
TheReturnOfNumber1::He's calling us losers, yet he's trolling our board in the middle of the night.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::All Heat fans are Bandwagons, so it's not like they experienced anything themselves
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Don't listen to Heat fans, every single one of them is a Front runner/Bandwagon
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::they will be laker fans in 2 years
Jordan_93_29::"I'm not a frontrunner, I've been a Bulls fan ever since Jordan started winning championships" -Bulls fans
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::me 2
My Name Is Goran Dragic. You Stole My Mentor. Prepare To Die::Sure.
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::All these "Bulls fans" weren't even alive the last time the Bulls were relevant.
TheReturnOfNumber1::Nice try, but I grew up watching MJ and the Bulls teams of the 90's.
TheReturnOfNumber1::Much better than becoming a Heat fan ever since LeBron won his first and only championship.
heat nation toronto::D-Rose is the best pg in the game.... hope he comes back by playoffs... can't stand watching Chris "overweight" Paul taking Derrick Rose's throne
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::I came back to say your comment is fu.cking stupid. Fu.kRose and i hope he rots
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::karma is a bit.ch
heat nation toronto::u a troll now for hating on d-rose
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::Rose is a lesser version of Westbrook.
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::Westbrook has been to the Finals and has never missed a game of basketball since High School, College and the NBA.
heat nation toronto::westbrook is a poor man's rose
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan Iverson carried a scrub team to the Finals.    Rose chokes with a 60+ win team.  lol you sound like a moron. Rose was the "MAIN" reason the Bulls won 60 games. He doesn't have one other player on his team who can create his own shot. Stop hating loser
TheReturnOfNumber1::They don't hand out awards for getting your team to the finals. Iverson carried a scrub team to 0 championships.
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::You have to get there to win it.  Rose wouldn't know anything about that though.
Jordan_93_29::HOLDING ONTO HIS KNEE, HOLDING ONTO HIS KNEE AND DOWN
Jordan_93_29::Remember when D Rose got completely SHUT DOWN in the 2011 ECF? HAHAHAHAHA
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::After the first game, I think he shot like 32% or some garbage number.  He was shooting 9% in the 4th quarter, getting shutdown by a guy 50 lbs heavier than he is.
I Took Passing Lessons from Kobe::AND HE WAS HEALTHY YET THEY STILL MADE EXCUSES LMFAO
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::SMD Bulls fans. I'm out.
TheReturnOfNumber1::Goodbye, frontrunning Heat fan.
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::go fuc.k your mother and get aids
Jordan_93_29::You mad?
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::Fu.ck all you Bulls fans. SMD.
TheReturnOfNumber1::Should be interesting to see how many so-called Heat fans jump ship after LeBron leaves them next year.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Yup probably 90% of the "HEAT FANS"
Mr. C1ean::It'll be like some Laker fans this year.
Jordan_93_29::D-Rose is the poor man's Allen Iverson.
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::you have made your way to the fool's zone
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::Iverson carried a scrub team to the Finals.  Rose chokes with a 60+ win team.
kensuave90::I'm SOOO glad we picked Kirk up during the offseason
kensuave90::Oh I'd like to believe that. Honestly, as a Bulls fan who was in the stands praising Captain Kirk's 3's those years ago I really do wish it was just an "off game". But averaging 6.8 points a game?!?! With 5 assists per game?!? Giving up the most fouls on the starting lineup? I fail to see the return on investment.
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::kirk is good he just had a off game
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::D.ROSE AND DOMINATED i can't wait to see the heat fans standing outside the arena crying and burning jersey's in 2 years  Nope they will just hop on the Lakers Bandwagon lol
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::Like the Heat fans were standing outside the arena here?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncCEMZvA5m8
Mr. C1ean::I hate the Heat (no more than the Lakers), but you need to attend grammar school.
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::ahahahahahahahahaha
I Took Passing Lessons from Kobe::How many championships do the Bulls have ever since Jordan left? NONE  How many times have the Bulls gone to the Finals since Jordan left? NONE
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::6 &gt; 2  I've seen 6 you've seen 2. What's better loser?
bycrackyrules77::you weren't born when Kobe $@%!$@ your mother moron!
I Took Passing Lessons from Kobe::You weren't born when Jordan played LMFAO
DandifiedOsprey::are we sure rose even wants to come back to this pitiful team?
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::Rose needs to go away
Jordan_93_29::Why the hell haven't the bulls amnestied Boozer?
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::i can't wait to see the heat fans standing outside the arena crying and burning jersey's in 2 years
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::Like the Heat fans were standing outside the arena here?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncCEMZvA5m8
TheReturnOfNumber1::Tough game vs Hawks coming up Monday at home. Gotta take care of business at home.
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::aka, tank
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Q: How many titles has LBJ won in a Full Season??  A: 0  LBJ has and always will be a loser and Choke artist. Jumping on D. Wades team will never change that.
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::Rose couldn't even win a NCAA Championship after cheating on his SATs to get into college.  Like always, he choked at the Free Throw line and let Daddy Chalmers bang a 3 right in his face.
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Rose has been in the league for 4 years LBJ has been in the league for 9 years MORON
Jordan_93_29::How many championships has D Rose won period?
I Took Passing Lessons from Kobe::Its still a ring  How many does does Rose have? NONE
TheReturnOfNumber1::Mario Chalmers was ballin' tonight. 34 points!  Then again, it is the Kings..
hammer1095::Poor Heat fans....leaning heavily on Mario Chalmers...gotta love it...
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::You talking about Derrick Rose's Daddy?
Mario Chalmers is the Greatest PG Ever.::LOL he got no daddy. Rose only has a fa.ggot mom
BullsIrrelevantOutsideJordan::D Rose . . . . . . . . . Then D Fell
D.ROSE AND DOMINATED::don't worry bulls fans there will be no heat fans in 2 years
TheReturnOfNumber1::Seriously Heat fans, why do you feel the need to troll a Bulls board?
BearsBullsBlackhawks2013::Because their are losers who need entertainment in there day
