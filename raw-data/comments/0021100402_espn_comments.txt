adeptimg::Andy's out. We're done. Ho-hum, another  #1 draft pick.
1mproperDancing::Without Varejao we're not going to be winning many more games this season.  It reminds me of last year.  The team was off to a decent start, then Varejao went down and the wheels came off.
adeptimg::I am pumped though. We're gonna get answers about the younger players on this team and have a better idea where the needs are.
adeptimg::It remains to be seen if they're gonna be as bad as last year. Doubtful now that Mo and JJ are gone. That was rock bottom; but that may be what it takes to get a top pick. It may not be #1, but it's gonna be a good one. The draft is a deep one this time.
bababbaloo::Just wait until Gilbert outbids New York for Jeremy Lin when his contract is over. Think about it: Kyrie, Lin and Andy. One Word: Deadly. Lin moves to Shooting Guard and gets his playing time and Solves our problem there and Makes it easier on Kyrie with less pressure.
Jganon93::ahahh wow that is funny
william peragine::lmao
1mproperDancing::Why would Cleveland want two point guards?  Why would Lin want to go somewhere to be a back-up when he's starting in New York playing in a system that makes him look better than he would look in every other system?
DeanGibbz::why would he go to cleveland?????
kingdman2011::because clevelands better then detroit
chefcoolness11::semih erden should not have started.... hollins way better.
bababbaloo::Good Joke
Blazelover13::Really hope to see BOTH teams in the playoffs. Good win, Sixers. Cavs, don't let your injuries overtake you; you're an up-and-coming team and you're fairly talented. Keep fighting!
william peragine::only one thing i can say to cav fans...LEBRON JAMES....
BuckeyeheadKyle::Thanks, but when your two best players are injured. It's really hard to play good D, or be able to shoot. But, if we had a healthy Andy V at PF Antwan also at PF Kyrie at PG Sessions at guard. We would be good.
Giggity.iggity::Okay, this team is going to be god awful the rest of the year without Andy.  They're not very good to begin with but without Andy, this team has no center that can give us quality minutes.  As much as getting rid of Jamison for something sounds nice, what is this team going to do next year without a capable PG coming off the bench like Sessions or "the Jump-Shooter" at the 4&gt;?  I only see this team getting worse next season due to the lack of talent and the lack of ability to draw talent to this team.
PackinBay::Kaman to the cavs now!!!!
kingdman2011::wouldnt it be awesome if the cavs traded antawn jamison and sessions to orlando for an unprotected 2013 first round draft pick and turkoglus large contract
kingdman2011::reason i say that is you know howards gonna bolt, and we all know that team without howard will end up with a real high lottery pick, plus turkoglu not that bad of a player, we could probably turn around and trade him down the road for the missing piece, or worst case we buy him out
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I'm a little iffy on Sessions. I like his playing, but if we're going to build around Kyrie then build around him and trade Sessions while the iron's hot.
rockndoc2::Just Jamison please.
dprice5811::Leading off Disney's Sportscenter tonight:  Knicks vs Timberwolves.  Unreal!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Coming soon. The Lindex will be it's own anaimal on espn.com
dprice5811::b/c Rubio puts up a tough resistance on the D end.......  what a joke Disney is when it comes to sports, but yet I'm here.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I'f I knew another live chat site, I'd probably be there, but I also like to discuss football and baseball too. It's a one-stop shop.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Watching SportCenter this week and expecting a different lead = Linsanity.
dprice5811::Sorry, I'm a basketball fan, not a fad fan.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::As a post-LBJ Cavs fan, I know how you feel.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Nothing but Lin and Rubio highlights?
dprice5811::who and who?
BuckeyeheadKyle::Should we trade Antwan Jamison? He's had over 20+ points in the past 3 games and has rebounded for more than 10. The problem is he's 35. 35! His wheel's are going to fall off FAST after 37. I think we should trade him and maybe our 1st rounder to move up early in the draft and get a replacement like Anthony Davis or Andre Drummond. Comments?
kingdman2011::dont forget barnes, he's gonna be a star in the nba
iWitnessAccount::this is a bit like saying that you support world peace (and I am not talking about the ron formerly known as artest), namely, we can all agree its a good idea in theory but the devil is in the details.  which rebuilding team is about to give us a high lottery pick for a lower pick and a 35 year old PF?  If you can find one, trade with them and run away, run away quickly.  The teams that will trade for him are playoff contenders looking for bench scoring, they do not have lottery picks.  hence the rub.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::With the upcoming draft deepened by the lockout, I wouldn't mind the lower pick.
rockndoc2::its 15mill this year.  You have to take 15mill back
rockndoc2::His contract isnt a cap killer.  Its over after this year.  The problem is what you have to take back kills your cap
kingdman2011::true, but the cavs were willing to take on that awful baron davis contract and how did that work out, i know he was amnestied but nobody knew amnesty was coming at the time, not to mention if it wasnt for that trade you would have mo williams and jamario moon instead of kyrie irving, besides no big name free agent is gonna come to cleveland so the best we could probably do in free agency is signing a second rate star like iggy, granger, or gay to a max contract, so i see no problem in taking on a big contract
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I knew it expired this year, but what about this year? How does it affect this season's cap?
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::The question isn't IF to trade him, but to who and for what. His contract's a cap-killer, but on a team that needs that's final piece/depth, he can make a world of difference.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::No "twolls" from Minnesota. No "LBJ is gone" trolls. Kinda nice, actually.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Games like this will give the Cavs a deeper bench when the starters like Kyrie and Andy return.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Someone on the Knicks page just posted "Lin for Prez, Tebow for VP and LeBron for UN Ambassador." ESPoliticsN, anyone?
Madhouse_United::lol
KingGeorge53::Gotta run.      Good chatting with you as usual.     Let's go Cavaliers!     btw, sincerely, best wishes to the sixers and their fans.
rockndoc2::Later
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::"Night!
yata9arasu::Andy has a broken wrist.......  :(  Wow....  Out indefinitely........
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Ugh.
KingGeorge53::IMO, the best player at the moment on the team.
yata9arasu::I am happy with Jamison!  Him and Sessions keep raising their trade stock!  :D
rockndoc2::Speaking of last years draft, the upside of Andy's wrist is Thompson will get alot of run.   He needs it to develope his game.  I hope he becomes more than JJ Hickson
rockndoc2::I'm not sure.  Blake would be adequate for two years behind Kyrie, and the LA or Dallas pick will be around 20-25.  That could get you a true center in this draft.
KingGeorge53::and they say it's a deep draft.    However, it's only as deep as the GMs pick.    this past year was suppose to be weak, but there are a lot of very good rookies.
rockndoc2::As for Sessions.......to LA for Blake and a first makes sense for both teams.
KingGeorge53::dang....   double post
KingGeorge53::Do you think we get good value for our needs with this trade?
rockndoc2::I'm trying to find a trade that makes sense for Jamison, but I just cant find one.   I cant find 15mill tha the Cavs would want to take back, while at the same time a team would be willing to jettison.
KingGeorge53::Maybe this new kid Uzah will be Cleveland's answer to Lin.   ;p
rockndoc2::Good point .   You would have to take back a real bad 2-3 year deal and get a first
KingGeorge53::Hoping Grant can pull another MoFlo, Moon for Kyrie and Baron Davis type trade again.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I think this an acceptable "wait for next year" situation. Sessions for a first-rounder, Jamison for cap room...
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::It seems like he's not in his groove in Scott's system when it's fully running. Think Dallas might take him for a draft pick?
KingGeorge53::Jamison is getting a lot of negative comments, I was one of those, but he has value to a contender.    Scoring machine still at his age.
KingGeorge53::Y E S !
ScalabrineSwag::Wait until the Bulls beat the Knicks by 30. The hype will stop then.
Madhouse_United::I can't wait until we face them.
kingdman2011::like this if youre tired of hearing about jeremy lin
rockndoc2::Its New York.  Yippee.  they have something to cheer about because they will be tortured by Melo.   He will come back and put a stop to all this.
Madhouse_United::I personally am almost at the breaking point. I don't mind Lin, But the hype is getting excessive.
Madhouse_United::Well he plays, for NY. Of course they will try to get the most out of the story.
KingGeorge53::It is... but it's ESPN.   If you don't pay attention to ESPN, you'd never have heard of the guy.  Jamison has had an outstanding week scoring, but ESPN would NEVER report it.
KingGeorge53::whitney houston fan?
yata9arasu:::(  R.I.P.
KingGeorge53::Sad.    So much talent used and abused.
rockndoc2::Wow, I heard she expired.   Another life taken by chemical dependency.
rockndoc2::BTW, just got back from the game.   I called it at 105-79 and it was about that.   Cavs have nothing inside without Andy.   They looked like the same team that lost 26 games last year.  Yep, that was them.
yata9arasu::I am in NE Ohio..........  Soooo..........
KingGeorge53::Not too bad in Central Ohio.     We've got some snow, but not as bad as what you guys are talking aboutl
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::You ever see "lake effect" snow?
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Well, there goes my plans for tonight.
yata9arasu::The roads were horrible today.....  I couldn't see anything after a couple hundred feet.  Plus my car and others were sliding around.......  :/
rockndoc2::Not real bad.  Back in Mentor now.  But worse than we've seen this year.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I agreed about 50 posts ago. I heard roads are getting bad. Is that true?
yata9arasu::Knicks fans were horrible this year.  By far the worst and I couldn't believe the Trail Blazers fans....
KingGeorge53::agree.   I've had a lot of good conversations with pre-july 2010 heat fans.
yata9arasu::I know.....  I don't get it.  I really expected the Heat fans to be the worst.  They are still bad but the true Heat fans are not that bad.
KingGeorge53::What's up with Portland fans this season?      Did a bunch of peeps from Florida move to the NW?
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::ESPN does a great job covering sports in ALL of the U.S. as long as it's within 150 miles of Bristol Conn.
Madhouse_United::It's sad sometimes but I don't mind it all that much.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::"National" baseball writer Peter Gammons gets paid by the Red Sox reference.
Madhouse_United::Fact.
rockndoc2::Dont worry Philly and Bulls Fans.    Lin will fail.   He cant get past Melo.
ImYourHuckleberry.::HAAA!!!!  Melo plays sweet D against his O.
Madhouse_United::I never thought that with those two they would dig themselves up in the hole that they did early on. It will be interesting to see how it plays out when they are at full strength.
KingGeorge53::Will the Knicks be worse when Melo and Amare get back?   Who takes the shot?
yata9arasu::Lin is great and all but you have to know he is playing well because of a couple reasons: 1.  The system is very helpful for him.(  NY offense is a fast break offense like D'Antoni with the Suns). 2.  He shot 30% and had a bunch off assists and reb. 3.  He is averaging 40+ min a game. 4.  Only scoring option without A'mare and Anthony.
KingGeorge53::add to it there's not a book on the kid.   Now that he's played for a week, teams will get wise to what he uses as his finish move when he drives to the basket.
ScalabrineSwag::My thoughts: True fans of the Heat, Bulls, and Sixers hate the knicks and lin right now bc we recognize them as a potential threat. You guys with me?
Madhouse_United::Lin could still be a threat with what I've seen though.
ScalabrineSwag::Rose is scores better than Lin.
Madhouse_United::Lin: sure, The team as a whole: Not really.
ScalabrineSwag::Phili fans: I'm a bulls fan and since you guys are a fellow eastern conference elite team im asking Are you tired of Lin yet??? Knicks fans are so freaking cocky right now. They're getting to the point where they are almost as bad as the heat fans.
rain_man429::I don't pay attention to them much...Let them enjoy it while it lasts...
Mja10178::yeah scal's i like Lin but not all this ridiculous hype from espn and knicks fans....its nauseating.
KingGeorge53::I had to laugh at ESPN today.     Every other thread they had was "Lin".
kingdman2011::makes it worse that those same clowns won the super bowl
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Cavs fan, but NY thinks it's self-entitled to own the world.
Madhouse_United::That's why I dislike them. But they will fall as usual. Take it from a Bulls fan who has enjoyed watching them fall at our expense :) They still had a good team back in the day though.
ScalabrineSwag::Basically saying championship for knicks...lin for MVP. First of all the elite teams in the EC are the Bulls, 76ers, and as much as it pains me to say it  the Heat. Not the Knicks.
Madhouse_United::Knicks will falter at some point. I'll admit however that they are playing well. Fellow Bulls Fan here.
yata9arasu::They are being cocky.  He struggled tonight.  I still think he is a good player but I do not think he will keep it up.
EliNeu06::He struggled and still went for 20 pts 8 dimes 6 boards...and his team won..hes the real deal.  Im a sixers fan.
yata9arasu:::(  Missed the game....  Good game 76ers!  Hopefully we can get Irving, Parker, and Varejao back soon.  Good luck Philly!  :)
KingGeorge53::Sixers a rising team.    It's always a bad thing when we have to start Erden.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::It was just as good as one would hope.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Trolls who make LBJ references will now be referred to as "Sonics fans" since coming into a Cavs page with that outdated a reference is like going to Seattle expecting to find grunge rock everywhere.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Another weapon I use against LBJ-based Cleveland bashing. Maybe Gilbert was right about "taking it with him." http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45hdlg/1-miami-fla/#content?partner=yahoore
hotepbubba::Seattle is one of the greatest cities in the USA.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::True. Maybe I should call them "Knick fans" instead. That'll really throw them for a loop.
KingGeorge53::I think some of the mods are the ones starting the trolling.
KingGeorge53::I just click the flag button for those posts.    Perfect example of ESPN's troll rules.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I don't trust the mods, who can't even find spammers.
Frank Reynolds 5::Crap teams nba tv tonight
KingGeorge53::Rooting for the Sacs every game this year.     Want that extra pick.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::How noble and selfless of you.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Suns-Kings. Whoa. This matchup could have MASSIVE draft lottery impact.
Frank Reynolds 5::Yea it's him lol
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::For a second I thought one of the Suns looked a lot like Grant Hill. Then I realized...
Frank Reynolds 5::It's the very old vs the very young
KingGeorge53::Crap trolls on the ESPN threads tonight as well.
Frank Reynolds 5::That is normal
76ers fan 11::sweet game by Jure tonight love his go to the hoop mentality tonight
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Scott should pull some of his players aside and show what aggressive ball is.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Next season's going to seem easy if we stay healthy. With a good draft, I'd say we're the Nuggets of the East.
KingGeorge53::They played very aggressively last night.    Just fell short when Jamison missed the free throws at the end of regulation.   I'm happy with the overall way the team is working hard.    B2B2B are always difficult, especially with so many injuries to 3 key players.
KingGeorge53::Seems like the young man has good potential in this league.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Aww, did we just successfully mess with Texas?
KingGeorge53::Here's a random entry from a "fan" of neither of these teams;    Chompster777 spurs will destroy your team 2 fans like this. 22 Minutes Ago · Like · Reply · Flag
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I give them extra points if they don't refer to LBJ.
KingGeorge53::However, that's not really a bad trolling statement.   A trolling statement to be sure     Just simply a strange and random message aimed at making fans of the Cavs angry.
KingGeorge53::Ding Dong alert.   LOL    It's always interesting to see what goofball will show up on any given night.    Tonight it must be the re.je.cts from San Antonio.
Chompster777::i am very sorry for saying that then, ill just tell the mavs they suck
theSwayzeExpress::SA is dirty this year, I'll give them that, just a deadly consistent team that can play D.  There gonna make some noise in the west this year
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Don't know what to tell ya then.
Chompster777::there arnt any
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I don't think nets fans will respond any kinder.
Chompster777::i meant nets....
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Maybe...maybe not. But coming on here with "The Spurs will destroy your team" doesn't sound like you're trying to make friends. Or at least me. That's not how I roll, G.
Chompster777::am i trying to make anyone mad??
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Yeah. That's what I said.
KingGeorge53::It's always amazing to see what group of fans randomly bop in an attempt just to try make some other teams' fans angry.    I see those posts and click on "Flag" with the inappropriate comments.
Chompster777::up 19
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::They're bored from being up by 19 over NJ tonight. But then again, if NJ fans can handle Knicks trolls, then Spurs trolls should be  easy.
Chompster777::??
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Guess not. You're still here.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Ugh. Just looked at the box score. Another game below .400 shooting.
KingGeorge53::Yeah.    Poor shooting and even worse D tonight.    It also looks worse after such a good effort the past week.
I know more than you boy::Expected that with our 2 best guys out.
KingGeorge53::Not enough Kyrie's.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::But even when they're healthy, it's still not good. We're one of the lesser-shooting teams in the NBA. Even FTs.
KingGeorge53::Tough loss for the good guys.        Wild Thing, AP and ROY on the bench.    However, good road win for the Sixers.     Best wishes to the improving sixers and fans.  Let's Go Cavaliers!
Frank Reynolds 5::The Indians should bring back ten cent beer night I would make the 8 hour drive for that.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Bring some Geno's when you do.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I'll trust your judgement, sir.
Frank Reynolds 5::I would bring some better steaks from a better place lol
TomBradyisoverrated::Hey Cavs fans....when is Lebron gonna come back and save ya?
gkm456::i am a cavs fan but a michigan fan too so i hate ohio but the cavs have a lot of work to do they need to get another top 5 guy this year and a top 10 guy next year and they will have a good bench to maybe make the playoffs
TomBradyisoverrated::Ohio is the state everyone laughs at.

I know more than you boy::Cavs have a brighter future than the Spurs. Fact.
KingGeorge53::flux capacitator
I know more than you boy::Let's see .. the Cavs have the ROY, and will have a lottery pick in this deep draft coming up, and the Spurs have an old Duncan, old Manu, and aging Parker. Yeah I'm sure the Spurs will have the brighter future....
TomBradyisoverrated::LOL! You are why Vegas gets rich.
Chompster777::ur dumb
I know more than you boy::Maybe they'll find a Delorian.
Chompster777::it can happen...
I know more than you boy::Oh I forgot Duncan, Manu, and Parker are gonna step into a time machine and go back to their primes.
FlyGuys623::dont get why there r so many spurs fans here anyway. saturday night and ur spending it on a sixers-cavs board smh
KingGeorge53::Good question Flyguy.    Usually the spurs have better fans than this, but I guess every NBA has it's re.$@%!$ and they happened to pop in on our board tonight.
TomBradyisoverrated::get help. You sound like a serial killer
TomBradyisoverrated::Cleveland is known as the mistake on the lake. What a joke these dumb @ss people are.

TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Portion control, eh?
DannyMejia15::yup
lonislonisloins2.0::Cool
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::This game feels a bit like last year after we lost Delonte, Z, Shaq, and that other guy who's now in Miami. Playing with nothing but the end of the depth chart.
lonislonisloins2.0::Anyone who thinks Charlotte is better than Cleveland needs to die
I know more than you boy::We are sooo screwed without Andy. Silver lining in his injury is that we'll get a better draft pick.
