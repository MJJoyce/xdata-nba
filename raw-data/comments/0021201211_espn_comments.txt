mpoph::Wow! Goran Dragic is always elbowing Jeremy Lin left and right every single time they meet and he of course did it a lot more when the games were in Phoenix. Dragic has repeatedly (thus they weren't accidents) taken cheap shots against Lin who is playing his former position with his former team.    Next season would be payback time for Dragic if not sooner. What goes around comes around for the guy who's turned out to be ruthless and brazen to be doing it all the time. Lin should pay back the recurring "accidents" himself. Harden gave him one but Dragic is owed about 16 more from 4 games. Dragic should have been a hockey player.
Denzel7587::The Rockets play so much better without Harden. Better ball movement, aggressive plays. Harden sucks out the competitive spirit of the Rockets with his kind of play. When Harden struggles in his shooting, he tends to revert to his ballhogging ways and usurps the PG role from Lin and Beaverly. There is too much politics within the Rockets that results in the unfair treatment of Jeremy Lin. If Lin is not able to play his role, better sit him throughout the game. And if Beaverly is politically acceptable to Harden, let this talented PG play his role. With Harden playing, Beaverly barely makes assists. this is crazy because this guy can make 3 fast assists in two minutes of play.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Lin went off becasue of Kendall Marshall worse defender in the league, he still played well but Dragic has his number.
Centre01::It is better for the Rockets to stay at 7th place, otherwise they have play Denver in the first round of playoffs which both teams play similar type of games, and Denver is better at it.
laraven1216::Harden 5-19 4reb 4to Lin 8-19 4 assists 2 to  Tucker 21pt 5reb Dragic 21 14 assists  Does anyone get what I am saying they both sucked last night -8 when Lin on the court -20 when Harden on the court both have to be at their best for us to win in the playoffs neither is Michael Jordan or even Durant but we need both too win move on with the LIN VS HARDEN stuff.
fred3857::Rox had retrieved from 11 pts behind at 2nd qtr until Harden come back with no score ,TO and no D.Then, again at last 5 mins everybody disappeared and just watching Harden played his iso,TO and scoreless no D lost game.
dasun47::Lin started slow during first quarter but was amazing afterwards. Only when he left at the end of the third quarter, after which he led the team to its only lead, did the team began spiraling down. McHale never put him back until less than 4 minutes left in the game, during which he was never put in a PG or facilitator position - which he obviously excels - nor did he one time. He was without a turnover until under less than a minute when the game was already decided. No, Lin didn't suck at all. Given the leadership and role of facilitating, no doubt the team's chance of winning would increase remarkably. Unfortunately, that has been the most  significant letdown all season long. Hard to imagine the coaching staff, let alone management, can be this stupid not to make this simple revision to emphasize Lin's role to everyone and make changes accordingly. The "experimentations" by the coaching staff went too far. Until this happens, the Rockets will reflect the same team that has been shown this season - low end playoff team at best. If the change had been made earlier, I really think they could have been ten games better in the standings
MTN_HIGH_CO::Who's afraid of the big bad Nuggets?  Hope you get swept by the Spurs....
Dezagcoog::The suns aren't going to the playoffs. DUH
WholeoftheLaw::If I were a Rockets fan I'd boycott the rest of their games.  Don't buy into the hype of OKC versus Harden.  Isn't your favorite team more to you then some media spectacle?  Screw this garbage.  They could have and should have won yesterday's game if the coach COACHED and they didn't let one man dominate the show.
dasun47::Hey Dez, too bad you are a very stupid one - if a Rox fan at all. Whole is actually right on with his comment about the Rox.
Dezagcoog::Good thing you're not a Rockets fan then huh?
dplunk18::Don't know why Rockets fans are so upset..they are only a decent team at best..they could very well finish with the final playoff spot in the west
dasun47::@dplunk - the fans are mad knowing the team could have been way, way better than where they are now despite their "inconsistency". With new coaches and slight revision to its offense and defense, as well as players' roles, they could easily be ten games better - and that's with the player personnel they already have! You are looking to deep into your $@% to think the Rockets are only a "decent" team at best. Teams making the playoffs are way above that.
TX rainman::yawn, shut up
bassadilla05::The Rockets are still pretty inconsistent. Young teams always are. That's why the Cav's, Wizards, Magic, and Kings all CAN look really good at times, but you never really know what you're going to get. The Rockets are certainly a step or two above those teams, but the comparison is there. Harden, Lin, Parsons and Asik have all grown into their roles this year and we're in the playoffs, but in another universe we probably end up behind Dallas in the West.
Queen88022::Some "Rockets fans" should watch the game before bashing Lin based on his assist numbers.  Lin dominated the 2nd Q and run offense perfectly. Rockets were leading. Lin outplayed Dragic. But after Harden came and played as a heroic PG late 2nd Q,  Rockets lost the leading.  Harden CAN'T play PG. He can't assist against tough teams. He could be a good SG. Face the facts. Period.
fred3857::As a former basketball player,we know very clearly that many games lost are all bcs of Harden's selfish iso,no D,more TO and scoreless at last 3-5 mins especially when Rox face tough defense teams as no matter Harden get how many scores,they gave away more to their opponents. If Rox coach staff don't realize this truth to adjust to play more J-Lin as PG and Harden pay more at D and PG,then they will have no chance to advance to 2nd round playoff and even been blew out.
dasun47::It's pretty evident by most observers - media, fans alike - that they hold the same thoughts as you about the team and its players, not to mention the failures of the coaching staff. I can't imagine that this team will be playing the same exact way, with the same players and coaches. If they do, I can only hope that Lin, Parson, Smith, Jones, and maybe even Robinson, find themselves elsewhere on other teams who can appreciate their skills. Maybe they can be traded to the Lakers for Howard!
hupirate06::If the Lakers beat the Rox tomorrow, the Lakers will move to 7th and Rox goes to 8th, even though Rox will still have the better record?
dasun47::It's like, go ahead "take your pill" - OKC (8th), SA (7th), DEN (6th). So, no matter what anyone says, YOU can determine your own fate in the playoffs. Answering the question "Who do you most match well against?" can have a way to influence a team's play during the last few games of the season.
dplunk18::Both teams record will be the same (LA will have better conference record)
pico2013::what is the point in Suns winning these games?????? they need a lottery pick. This Suns win helps the Lakers big time.   If Lakers beat Rockets tomorrow night, Lakers get the 7th seed, Rockets 8th seed.
dplunk18::What's it to you if this win benefits the Lakers, since the Suns arent in the Playoffs anyway?
CaliHurricane::Suns have our(Lakers) first round draft pick
CaliHurricane::They have our 1st round draft pick
GEORGE .W. BUSH IS THE MOST BELOVED PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME::OMG OMG I KNEW IT...IT WAS HAREN'S 5-30FG, 9 TURNOVERS AND ZERO DEFENSE THAT KILLED THE ROCKETS AGAIN! WHEN WILL MCFAIL EVER LEARN THAT HAREN'S ISO CRAP 3 TIMES IN A ROW WON'T CUT IT?;)
HoustonPittsburghfan::Why are people still bothering to compare Lin to Dragic?  Who's on the team that's heading to the play-offs?  Who's on the team that's gonna finish last?
dasun47::Lin is way, way better than Dragic. Not even in the same conversation. @TX rainman - of course I expected that from you. Not sure why you even follow bball if that stupid.
moncindy007::Dragic was Playing THE pg in his team. JLin was not playing his real role  pg in rockets today. Dragic should match with Harden.
TX rainman::dragic &gt; lin.  11 more assists? and u already know better shooter.
MadeFreeThrow::If LA beats HOU in the final game, does HOU drop to to the 8th seed?
dplunk18::With a Laker victory, LA would tie the season series with Houston and, by virtue of the next tiebreaker (record against conference foes), would leapfrog Houston. In that scenario, the Lakers would be the No. 7 seed and the Rockets would be the No. 8 seed.
george3dale::Yes!
Denzel7587::End of first quarter with Harden as the playmaker: 28-39 Suns. 11-points deficit for the Rockets. Lin as playmaker in the first six minutes of the 2nd quarter (Harden on the bench): tied the score to 50-50.  Harden came back and the Rockets never caught up with the Suns. What's really annoying with Harden is he can contribute more to the team when he focuses on his role as SG. After all, he's the only ELITE SCORER of the Rockets. But for some reason, he is really trying to be PG of the team and giving less attention to his role.
Denzel7587::Harden is the only reason the Rockets are in the playoffs. Wow, really??? The contributions of Asik (very high contribution to the team), Parsons, Lin and other players have no value at all. Maybe, the Rockets should try to put the Beard alone in the court against five players so we can see his superhuman contributions. I'm really annoyed with statements that Harden is the only reason we're in the playoffs. he has sucked several times this season and he's still the only one that matters.
bassadilla05::Harden's arrival helped change the mindset of the team. His presence gives everyone else confidence. I think he's brought the team some synergy at the same time that our other pieces have stepped up their game.
TX rainman::without harden, we would be 20-52
Denzel7587::Dragic 15 assists Lin 5 assists. Thus, Dragic &gt; Lin. Agreed at this point, but Dragic plays the PG in his team, while Lin is not. Harden is the team's PG now. Dragic's 15 assists should be compared to Harden's assists. It's not really fair to Lin because people are judging him always as a PG but he's not allowed to play his role.
realityonetoo::Congrats, Suns. You just moved down in the draft by a spot, all else being equal... Idiots.
typical 3-pointer::As a rocket! I am not upset we lost against PHX.   I rather face SA then DEN ...  SA is just too slow for us ... DEN on other hand has speed and skill
CaliHurricane::If you lose Wednesday you drop to the 8th seed and play okc tho
truth2dat::Harden fans are phony. they talk LOF this LOF that, but in reality they are the true "player-ONLY" fans for caring ONLY about Harden. Lin fans want the team to do well (most are fans of team basketball). Harden fan=Harden fan. TRUTH!
TheTruthDontLie7::Ya thats' right cuz Lin gunna beat those L.A.'s tomorrow just watch!!!
TheTruthDontLie7::Team yes maybe, only if they pass ball to him, and McFail let him have the ball. Don't doing stupid subs taking Lin out way too early...hope Haren don't play PG or I won't care about this team very much
truth2dat::no, Lin &amp; the team, get that right! lol
TheTruthDontLie7::I ONLY WORSHIP GOD OF LIN, BEFORE GOD OF YAO MING, BEFORE THAT ATHEIST

123abc456xxy::Paul Coro #Mercury No. 1 pick Brittney Griner's first dunk at US Airways Center. http://t.co/mlkETOaVMe 42 Minutes Ago if she play in nba.... guys love to  guard her.
wrongcolor::McFail and Morey got their wish..OKC vs Rockets and first round exit.
123abc456xxy::even if he know mc-dumb cant coach, mc-dumb has 1 more year. he cant just fire him,
NDFRockets18::they haven't "gotten their wish" yet. Last I checked Houston is still the 7th seed about to play a Kobe-less Lakers that were already a disappointment with him
NDFRockets18::lol awkward typo
sportsfan1014::7th
123abc456xxy::its not morey fault.. it harden and coach mc-dumb fault.
bassadilla05::LOL, McHale is getting some national attention for the Coach of the Year award. Looks like you simply can't see the benefits McHale brings to the team.   p.s. - Not saying he'll win, but he is being talked about as worthy of the award
Skatingseveneleven::Nothing wrong with Harden , you fool!  Don't put Harden together with Mcfail .
wrongcolor::Morey should have known that McFail cant coach.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Rockets are better without Harden.
LetsGoAtlantaHawks::am i the only one who thinks rose is gonna make a surprise return in the playoffs?
123abc456xxy::YEA. u the only 1.. this is not a bulls blog. like we care if rose play or not.
Bulls Bears Cubs::Well, I do care...  so he is not the only one.
sportsfan1014::nope, not before he passes his SAT
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::They went on 12-3 run because the worse defender in the nba Kendall Marshall was guarding Lin. Lin played well tonight but Dragic got no calls I love that bs call where Lin lost the ball and they gave him 2 Fts Dragic got hacked on his first 3 and no call.
123abc456xxy::TALKING ABOUT HACK.. ROCKETS GOT HACK MORE THAN THE SUNS.. REF JUST GIVE THIS GAME AWAY.
Swish3And1::How do you know Marshall is the worst defender in all of NBA???
sportsfan1014::because he said so..
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Lin only had 6 points on Dragic.
Swish3And1::Good point... Lin let Dragic get the better of him.
sports guy12::I wonder how many team's fans will be rooting for the Rockets on Wednesday?
NDFRockets18::Yeah forget the Cowboys, we can claim the "America's Team" nickname for Wednesday if Utah wins and we are the only thing between the Lakers and the playoffs
ayezeee123::Lakers' game winner vs. Warriors: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRumli2qLqg
NDFRockets18::hilarious
sportsfan1014::would be USA Rockets vs Starn, Refs, &amp; the Lakers on Wednesday
Hoops Sharpie::won't matter, utah won't win in memphis
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Dragic 15 assists Lin 5 assists.
Skatingseveneleven::LOH , go away ~
Hoops Sharpie::lin is terrible, we all know that except for the LOFs here
sportsfan1014::for those LOHs, Lin is always terrible no matter how he plays
Swish3And1::To be fair, Lin is not terrible. He's not superstar either.
sportsfan1014::Harden 2 asts &amp; 4 TOs
sportsfan1014::then should have been rested, Rockets made the run &amp; leaded by 4 before Harden back in the second qt.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::He was hurt.
123abc456xxy::I am not hating on Harden,   sometime when he is OFF, he should try to TRUST his teammate more.,and stop try to hero ball every game. When Harden was out, Lin still can win 4 game in a row without Harden. when Harden came back and played Denver, he play hero ball and loses that game too.
rm90025::I don't think Houston knows what offense to run.  It's going to cost them in the playoffs.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::He only played 5 mins in the 4th only took 2 shots.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Harden averages 6 assists
123abc456xxy::JAHII...SO LIN AVG 6.2 AST AND HAVE LESS MIN  THEN HARDEN
Hoops Sharpie::great outcome tonight, spurs are now ours in the 1st round which was our only chance of making it a series.  that being said, our PF's continue to be utterly rancid. too bad mchale was only willing to play DMo and robinson that whole time - both are utter trash and neither should be on the roster next year. one should definitely get cut or traded, and the other to the D-League.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Dragic had 15 assists Lins 5 assists.
Swish3And1::So the story goes, your PG Assist stats are only as good as your team shooting %.
rm90025::...and Lin had 20 points and brought his team back from a 10 point deficit in Q2 to a 4-6 point lead before Harden came back into the game and Houston subsequently relinquished the lead for good.  The other Houston players simply did not shoot well and turned it over too much.  That's why his assist number is about 3 or 4 below what it probably should've been.
Swish3And1::This is misleading, SUNS were shooting lights out in 1st quarter, like &gt; 60%. And Dragic was the only PG during that stretch. He already had 9 dimes in 1st Q.
123abc456xxy::harden 26 point per game, but he give up 15+ point to who ever guard him.
Swish3And1::Add to the list of things to improve next season. 1st item = DEFENSE... lol
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Harden is more than a scorer Lin only had 5 assists tonight.
Swish3And1::In today's game, when Harden came in, the Rox offense just slowed down and more TOs.
123abc456xxy::harden 0-9 whole 2nd half and you worry about assist.
123abc456xxy::LOTS OF YOU SAY B/C OF HARDEN , ROCKETS MAKE THE PLAYOFF... YOU BUNCH OF FOOLS... IT TAKE A WHOLE TEAM TO  CHIP IN... HARDEN -SCORER... LIN- TEAM PLAYER.. ASIK.. DEFENSE .. PARSON ALL AROUND PLAYER AND SCORER..
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Dragic and Harden would be cool lets give them some nicknames. SouthPaw?
123abc456xxy::THIS GAME, if harden got hurt that bad, ALL HE HAVE TO DO IS TELL MC-HAIL..  "MY KNEEL OR FEET HURT".
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::They wrapped a Brace around it he started 4/5 then ran into Scola retweaking it, it looked like just calm down.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::I was at the suns game tonight. This LOF behind me kept yelling at Harden, I then turned around and told him hes the only reason the Rockets are in the playoffs, then he gave me a classic LOF quote "If Lin ran the pg we would be a better team Harden is overrated" Idiot.
Bulls Bears Cubs::why harden is the ONLY reason Houston is in the playoff?  I guess other 11 players are just in the game for nothing.
Swish3And1::Did you just make that up?
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Yea but there was a LOF yelling.
AlexLeSJ::Yup, it's how it is here in H-Town
LetsGoAtlantaHawks::OKC is very beatable this year without harden
Hoops Sharpie::'very beatable'? uh no.
sports guy12::probably not for at least 2 rounds
LetsGoAtlantaHawks::i seriously dont get why teams dont double durant
Skatingseveneleven::Durant is always double teamed
Pete AZ::Well there goes the 3rd pick.
sports guy12::PJ Tucker missed the memo
Pete AZ::Apparently, as if he and the rest of the team had something to prove.
123abc456xxy::harden is a great scorer when he is a SG. HIS SHOOTING % IS HIGHER WHEN J-lin runs the pg. WHEN LIN IS THE PG, HE RUNS AROUND ALLOT FREEING UP SPACE FOR HIS TEAMMATE. HARDEN BENEFIT ALLOT BY STANDING IN THE 3 POINT LINE  AND HAVE EASY LOOK AT THE BASKET.
123abc456xxy::ANOTHER DR PHIL WANNA BE ..WHO CARES.. THIS IS NOT A SPELLING BEE CONTEST. HARDEN 0-9 THE WHOLE 2ND HALF
Skatingseveneleven::So what ! Harden is still the best !
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::U need to go take a breather. Lin ran pg most of the game today, Harden was hurt in and out and make sure you use spell check.
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Harden was hurt he looked slow.
123abc456xxy::SHOULD'NT HAVE PLAY WHEN HE HURT, COST US  A GAME. STOP TRYING TO BE A HERO EVERY GAME.
ayezeee123::shut up with those god danmn terms
Skatingseveneleven::Harden only hater ... stop liking your own ...
sports guy12::they said he banged his knee in the 2nd quarter
rsfhouston::Harden tries to get fouled too much when he drives. They won't be calling as many of those come playoff time so I hope he doesn't continue to play for the foul as much as he has during the regular season.
rsfhouston::OK. But they certainly won't call them down the stretch of a close game.
nuggetzalltheway23::That's what an ESPN broadcaster said. (I don't remember who) He said he would only average about 6-8 points a game if it was street balls.
NDFRockets18::To be fair they call those way more come playoff time.  I do agree though that the past month he has expected to get the call too much and doesn't always follow through with he shot or takes an ill advised one.
LetsGoAtlantaHawks::i honestly think if yao hadnt got hurt, the rockets would have won it all in 09
LetsGoAtlantaHawks::i think t-mac got hurt too
LetsGoAtlantaHawks::that was the end of his career basically
NDFRockets18::yeah he had micro-fracture surgery earlier that year in February
NDFRockets18::Seeing how every time Yao and Dwight played each other Yao absolutely demolished Dwight, that's not a bad statement
Dwight Howard Jnr::like if you would do Brittney Griner
wrongcolor::whats her cup size?
rm90025::Morey's comments were uncharacteristically critical of the team's performance.  I think he is upset by the benching of Asik (only 15 min played) by McHale.
NDFRockets18::good catch. I would be too, they got way too many offensive rebounds
