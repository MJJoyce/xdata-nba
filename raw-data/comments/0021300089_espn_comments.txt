John Keros::Defending Champ & MVP LeBron made $6,300 that last minute.
Art Salmons::HMMMM... when the Heat get their butts kicked in a stunning game, ESPN is not interested in putting that on the front page. Maybe somebody should call somebody else gay so it can be headline material.
Clinton Alford::We all know that ESPN is the official reality channel for Queen James and his cHEATS.
Patrick Fitz::Art Salmons...EXACTLY! if this was Lebron over the Celtics it would be replayed over and over and over again all night.
Jeff Brown::Doesn't ESPN give heat exclusive coverage with a daily South Beach update? Give me a break.
Tray Day::LMAOOOOOOO  JEFF GREEN NAILED A GAME WINNER IN LEBRICKS FACE......LEBRICK CHOKE JOB ONCE AGAIN....THIS TIME ON DEFENSE...LMAOOOO

Justin Jenkins::Brandon Tigues he did choke....all he had to do is play solid defense on jeff green for 0.6 seconds. how hard is that.? i thought lebron was a 1st team all defender? looks like hes just overrated on defense.
Nilla Di Nilla::Justin Jenkins good point bro

Kevin Gipson::That's hilarious....UP YOURS MIami Heat fans.
Harrison Moore::Lol Stewie is a Boston fan. Cool beans.
James Slattery::Dwyane Wade choke hahaha.
Clinton Alford::along with Lebron's terrible defense at the end of the game that allowed Green to hit the game winning shot.
Sherman Dudley::Wade didn't choke, he is just an idiot. All he had to do is to make the free throw and make it harder on the Cs but he tried to outsmart everyone and cost his team a win....oh well I'm happy we won
Shack Zaarur::Sherman Dudley   out smart and idiot in the same sentence....
Chelo Mejias::Love all the bandwagon fans of other teams are calling celtic fans bandwagon fans....that's irony at it's finest
Adriano Wind::More like, where are the Celtics Haters at now?
Chelo Mejias::Adriano Wind   They will be around, no matter if the c's win or lose....they love to linger
Adriano Wind::Ya that shows they are jeolous of the 17 banners. I thought u were a hater?
Nerissa C. Valido::Well done Boston!
Octavio Reed::COME'ON C'S PULL THE UPSET!!
Scott Struble::Even the empty seats are laughing.
Drew Korth::I miss the old ESPN boards for nights like this
Ed DeSalle::Spoelstra and Wade = Dumb and Dumber!!!

Wayne Bradley::Tony Familyman Blackburn lol!
Nilla Di Nilla::where was the "murder" you clown???????? HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAAA!!!! SUCK IT U HOMO!!!!
Mike Williams::A Brad Stevens led team defeated a team better than his? Nobody in Indiana is surprised.
James Slattery::What is Dwyane Wade is an idiot.  How stupid to not even hit the rim on that last free throw haha.
Sherman Dudley::A classic example of outsmarting yourself performed perfectly by Dwyane Wade
Robert Walter::Beautiful!!! Great win Boston! From a Bulls fan.
Marshall Burge::Beginning of end in Miami?
Ed DeSalle::like ur receding hairline?
Michelle Powers::Ed DeSalle , it should have been, "like your hairline."  Not what you said because what you said is his receding hairline is ending, which is a good thing for him.
Ed DeSalle::Tim Texan Stand corrected
Arlonte Duran::Wade choked this game
Art Salmons::They always say that down the stretch in a close game, to give the ball to your superstar and let that guy earn you points at the stripe. For Miami, that guy is Joey Crawford.
Derisse Bukle Perry::OMG....love my team Celtic pride yaaaaaaaaa
Casiano Servaz Tubana III::Suck on that Heat fans..
Adriano Wind::ESPN must be fuming because they were hoping to god that the Celtics would stink this year. Once again their hate makes the celtics stronger.
Joseph Giardina::C's have done pretty well even drafting in the mid-teens.  They got Al Jefferson there and spun him for KG.  So not too shabby.  Also got Rondo 21st in the 2006 draft.  Ainge has been solid finding talent no mattr where hes drafted
Adriano Wind::Ainge has drafted ok, but he's still a Loser who publicly admitted to Tanking and losing games just to risk a draft pick. He's a fraud and probably pissed they won tonight against the Champions and considers his own team losers haha.  Stevens needs to be the GM/coach like Red used to be.
