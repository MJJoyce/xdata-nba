Allen6338::I knew Blake was not all that good just a dunk from reality soon as teams figure out how to play him. If he does not get any dunks he can not be dominant or win:)
ididnotairballijustmisstheshot::Perkin hard foul on blake.griffin..retaliation???  you tell me  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc5ct27KJB8
Canes2082::And now we will watch the Clippers bandwagon of fans come slowly apart......
A-Dude-Playing-A dude-Disguised_as-another-Dude::Some1 for love of GOD, put a brown bag over Griffin head, one ugly dude
SJYankee1::BLAKE GRIFFIN IS A FRAUD
Pinkycuh::Clippers shot 29 3 pointers. Sounds like the 3 point contest.
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::Live by the 3, die by the 3.
tokken88::Nik Young needs to drive to the hoop. He is shooting over 90% since he has joined the Clippers. He needs to be averaging 10 FTA's a game.  Is it still possible to get an MVP for Chauncy? When Chauncy was in the line up the Clippers were serious contenders, without him the Clippers are playing like the Clippers of old.
Allen6338::Lets be for real Chancy is good on defensive player and sometimes he hits 3 point shots but he is no way a Super star that can take a team anywhere..There is a reason why other teams had gave him up. Chris Paul is out of shape and Griffin needs to learn how to take his game to the next level dunking is not going to get you a championship. Once the Lakers did not get Chris Paul the Clippers thought they were going to be the leaders in the West.  It will never happen.
drmcfunk::Next year with Chauncy back, hopefully a new coach and HOPEFULLY at least 1 series playoff series this year plus a regular length season we should be serious contenders.
Clipshow07::Wow, we're back to being a laughing stock.........what a surprise. Clipper curse in full effect. We absolutely suck! Worst defensive team in the league, can't even watch anymore.....and I thought it was bad watching when Kaman was on the floor....
drmcfunk::WE NEED A NEW COACH!!! DON'T LOSE HOPE CLIPPERS FANS ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS COME DOWN TO OUR OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS NOT WORKING!!! GET RID OF VDN
brob715::Tony Brothers needs to go, those technical fouls on Westbrook, Thabo, and Harden were unwarranted.
JLobello4::derek fisher going to the thunder gives this team a good veteran to help them go to the finals
E. Jack Culator::So which one of the ninja turtles does russell westbrook resemble most?
Westjag::yo mama
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::I for one am glad we signed D.Fisher, we have been needing help since Maynor is out all season. Oh and his basketball I.Q. and hus 209 post-season games will just help us in the Playoffs. Not to mention if we see the flakers in playoffs he will be able to tell the team all their moves and plays. Oh don't forget he has 5 rings to, how cool would it be for the Thunder to win it all this season. Just so Fisher can tell Kobe that he has more rings then him, since we all know Kobe want another so bad. Well Fisher has alot better chance at that 6th ring playing for the Thunder then any other team in the west. Glad to have you Fisher, welcome to the best Team in The NBA. GO THUNDER!!!!
WddNews.com::What will be funny is if the Clippers don't make the playoffs.
skippa18::clippers need a coach..
sanctie170::Mike Dunleavy!!
ChuckOlajuwon::This game kind of shows how far the other teams in the West are to being able to compete with OKC.  Spurs healthy maybe.
drmcfunk::last time we played OKC we dominated and they never came within 8 points, we can easily compete with them it starts with getting rid of Vinny Del Negro and getting a coach who can implement a well rounded offense and at least some defense
ichigo1783::The Spurs have OKC's number and have pretty much since the Thunder started. Granted I still think OKC wins in 7 in a playoff series, but the Spurs are a scary team. Only team in the west that I think can actually beat OKC in a 7 game series.
mydogtyson24::Chris Paul, holds on to the ball too long. This is what happens. The most over rated point guard in the history of the game.
drmcfunk::you guys clearly dont know what you are talking about, 2nd most steals in the NBA, 4th in Assists and 6th in overall efficiency, and 2nd highest scorer in the 4th quarter. No one is better at finishing out a game or getting other people involved.
mydogtyson24::I dont understand why you would need Paul, when you have Mo Williams? Relinquish Pauls salary cap and get better players around your current team.
Martin Rodriguez677::Not overrated. Just a hybrid of what's to come in the NBA.
mydogtyson24::The team was much better off with Gordan. I would put Mo Williams over Paul anytime!
ididnotairballijustmisstheshot::Jamess harden can balll  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ctt9IgKpaE
ididnotairballijustmisstheshot::fisher with the assist?? miss him already so weird with that okc uniform   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfKJ6jSNK8c
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::Get mad about the Thunder being +11 with D.Fisher on the floor. Great move Thunder great move.
ChuckOlajuwon::It was his only one, so dont feel too bad.
Gilchrest89::Startin' to look like the same Clippers as in years past!  Obviously missing a few pieces still and I think they are now in 5th place in the western conference.
ididnotairballijustmisstheshot::derek fisherr in action? haha  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfKJ6jSNK8c
Martin Rodriguez677::I'm a Lakers fan to the bone.   But it's not right that some Lakers fans are cannibalizing the Clippers right now. Show your seniority and some class, you f_gs. The only reason this was ever even a story is because NBA historians wanted to see some of those 'Magic-Sleepy Floyd'-type matchups interdivisionally, back when the Lakers really were legendary, and not just hated. I vote the Clippers should move back to San Diego. They're a legit mid-market city now with the Chargers and Padres. Or maybe Anaheim we know they want a team. It's a great budding rivalry. Any genuine Lakers fan knew eventually the Royal Blue &amp; Gold would emerge this year, at least in momentum towards the stretch. To me, just another metaphor of Lakers' lore that is great to see repeating. Clippers still have more than a fair shot to still take the division. I just think it's unlikely.

Forrest8732::the clippers suck
dscprecise::Lol at the Clippers giving Deandre Jordan 10.5 million a year in the off-season.  So If CP3 and Blake re-sign, the Clips will have 45 million per year committed to 3 players....... and a prayer that their owner will actually dip deep into the luxory tax just to add in some additional pieces.  In other words, enjoy your annual first round exit from the playoffs, Clipper fans.
NBA_refs_are_weak::said that literally the moment I heard the news on ESPN. They did so well in building young talent (at the time it was gordon, who translated to cp3) but either way they were looking good. But they just HAD to panic and overspend on jordan. They shouldve just let him walk if another team wanted to spend that kind of money on a pretty limited guy. Now as you mention, you look at their team and its easily going to be the thing that hampers them from taking the next step. Reminds me of dallas when they were stupid as hell and gave dampier that contract, and had some really good regular seasons but couldnt get over the playoff hump because they had a gigantic black hole of a contract that wasnt producing
slickSixtySix::is the guy adding any value at the moment?  (jordan)
DTangMF::I guess Clipps are not that good...
Lakermagicshowtime::duhhh
slickSixtySix::griffin and paul signed through 2013 right?
slickSixtySix::hop in griffin's kia
Lakermagicshowtime::lol
Lakermagicshowtime::screw them they need to get the f u c k out of staples
slickSixtySix::poor guys
Lakermagicshowtime::yeah thats it
Lakermagicshowtime::this bandwagon got empty fassst
Lakermagicshowtime::the stink of losing the clippers way is coming back
truesportfanman::The clips are 5th spot and falling fast.....
Lakermagicshowtime::Have to give it to Mike Brown he said that the team would be better as the season progressed
Lakermagicshowtime::Donald sterling have proven time and time again that he can turn a bag of gold into a pile of crap, paul and griffing will be gone after next season
HOLLOW51386::ARE YOU SUPRISED? ITS THE CLIPPERS. THEY COULD GET 5 ALLSTARS AND STILL LOSE. THAT FRANCHISE IS DAMNED
truesportfanman::Once a decade the clips are just a blip on the radar
Lakermagicshowtime::correction 6th
truesportfanman::bingo, falling and I can't keep up.
DaftShadow::Thunder vs Lakers Western Conference Semi-finals. Thunder 4, Lakers 0. Fisher will have the last laugh.
ichigo1783::OKC &gt;&gt;&gt; Lakers this year. Lakers got a bit better with Sessions, but overall the Thunder are the better team. If they meet in the playoffs I will give it to OKC in 5 games.
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::You faker fans are so full of it, it's becoming pathetic now. No team is scared of the fake show. Keep dreaming idiots, just like y'all said y'all would 3 peat last season. Y'all will not even make it ti the WCF. keep dreaming faker fans, the West goes through OKC.
lakerfan293092::1-0 la advantage in playoffs nuf said
BakoCowboys::Yeah Ramon scored 17 points and 9 assist thats pretty damn good its better then anything fisher has done all season so you can have him and everyone is giving the Thunder the title before they go through the Lakers twice we will see. They are going to be playin at staples
HOLLOW51386::WHAT A DUMMY.FISHER WILL NOT B THE REASON OKC WINS. IF THEY DO. IT WILL B DURANT AND WESTBROOK.
Lakermagicshowtime::Nah dont think so if OKC beat us is because of them having the better team not because of Fish he scored as many points as a backup tonight as he did as a starter on the Lakers watch out for Ramon
Lakermagicshowtime::Blake Griffin= Shawn Kemp all dunks and thats it
mydogtyson24::And dont forget Kemp was a beast on the boards and by far a better play maker and passer.
Jordsta4Life::Kemp was a much better fg and ft shooter.
Packnation21::"They were who we thought they were"- about the clippers, overrated
LilRaskal051893::CP3 or someone in that locker room needs to hold each other accountable. They have the talent and sure they miss Chauncey and sure the schedule has gotten tough.. But they need someone to seriously inspire them. Maybe its Vinny...They need to run more and more!!!!
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::Yep it is so simple, you have no clue when it comes to the NBA. @fakermagicshowtime
Lakermagicshowtime::overrated team thats all Blake and Paul and Donald Sterling dont work the same as Kobe and Paul and  DR Jerry Bush hahahahahaha is so simple
slickSixtySix::fire del negro
AngelsLakers714::Does anyone want to bet the Clips will not make the playoffs this year?  LOL
Lakermagicshowtime::That would make my season lol
slickSixtySix::lmao clips are done garbage back to going nowhere in the playoffs bet cp3 is wanting out now
Lakermagicshowtime::Stern screw him but i believe it was for the best for the Lakers
slickSixtySix::i didn't say he wanted to go (he had little to no choice)... but i do think he wants out now
Lakermagicshowtime::You think he really wanted to go to the Clippers?
Lakermagicshowtime::i was against the trade you  dont trade 2 bigs for a pg  period but it was intriguing
DJayLuck::all you guys need to stop with" oh man the clippers suck" bro  everyone has a bad day but you show true heart when u drive through everything... don't worry clips you'll get em next time. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Im a lakers, clippers(iv'e been a clippers fan since i was 2-months so don't even say im just a "bandwagon"), and seattle sonics fan(before they left)... lakers were gonna miss derek, he was a leader to us and he had heart i appreciate that.
RingCity_LA::yes the only banners i see in staple center are laker banners so keep laughing at those sorry clipper of urs btw lakers are ahead of them in the standings HA HA
Lakermagicshowtime::Yeah this 3 months clippers fans are on crack Blake and Paul will be gone after next season looks like they getting a dose of donald sterling
DJayLuck::oh really the past decade hahaha u make me laugh
RingCity_LA::clippers have had a bad game for the past decade they suck like seriously lol.
DJayLuck::that all players have bad games and this could of just a bad game for the clips so LOL back
AngelsLakers714::What's your point? LOL
theyorkallday::NBA players draft, all players are eligible... lebron goes #1 kobe goes late, wall goes #9 blake goes #6 full draft: http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
truesportfanman::whos's drafting, the mcdonalds in miami?
truesportfanman::In a loss like this clipper fans jump off the bandwagon like rats on a sinking ship.
truesportfanman::Lamar had one point tonight and Derek had three, it's hard playing without the Black Mamba.
Matthew Borba::Or on a team (in Derek's case) that have 3 go to shooters on floor with him only allowing him to take 3 shots with a team he just signed with on the same day. Nice try though.
CalaisYaY::lol at foye being the clips top performer
truesportfanman::When the clippers get pounded, you sure hear the sound of clipp. crickets.
RingCity_LA::Clipper fans Only Exist When They Win . lol
RDavison82::I think you mean womb not wound lol
DJayLuck::thank you
RingCity_LA::props to you.
DJayLuck::Nope not really. see iv'e been a fan since i was 2-months out the wound so yea
Pinkycuh::It's called a womb friend. A wound is what u get in a knife fight.
RingCity_LA::props to you.
RingCity_LA::Yeah i bet they were all laker fans they just heard chris paul to clippers and hopped on the clipper bandwagon.
truesportfanman::true bandwagoners.
dgreen978::Derek Fisher showed his true colors...you talk a good game about integrity and pride but you get traded to the Rockets, don't even show up for a physical or any meeting with the team but you showed up for a buyout of your contract and now you sign with the Thunders...Thunders' fans, you have a very very good team but this signing was stupid as hell; Derek Fisher is a liability that will hurt you in the end.
Matthew Borba::He's better than a rookie backup point guard when playoff time comes.
truesportfanman::I don't mind the thunder slowing it down.
truesportfanman::Penny marshal and billy crystal are not happy campers, but clipper darrell, through thick and thin deserves a sterling clipper kia.
KevinDurantFan56::LOL  Lakers doing better than the Clippers smh I guess the Lakers will always own the Clippers no matter what players they get.
AngelsLakers714::Except pre-season, that will be the only time the Clips own the Lakers! LOL
Ihatebandwagons::I don't think Thunder fans even exist... This board seems to be dominated by just losers thinking a loss is the destruction of the Clippers. Guess you don't watch a lot of basketball.
handball96::Thunder fans don't exist, only Thunder bandwagoners
KurtTGS::^^idiot.  Check the Thunder's attendance at home since they've been in OKC (including the first few rough seasons)  OKC has been enamored with them since the moment they arrived.  They are a new team, it takes awhile for it to spread outside of where they are located.  They are easy to like, are good, and have 3 superstars that are young.  Bandwagon?  Nope.  Good try though.  The rest of the nation is just late to the party.
truesportfanman::guess you haven't seen the clippers the past several years.
cixelsydmai::just better things to do and say my man
truesportfanman::It's hard to comprehend what blake griffin is trying to convey in those kia commercials.
CalaisYaY::oh clippers i told you this little phase of yours wasn't going to last
