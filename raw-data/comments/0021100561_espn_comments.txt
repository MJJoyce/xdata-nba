jeffymacleod::kings are a horribly run franchise. point one- why on earth would you draft jimmer fredette if you have evans. either trade evans for a high quality center (roy hibbert cough cough*) or small foward, or trade fredette.
YodaSucks::Oh you're back! Can't wait to hear more trade talk from you! Your thoughts on the trade you engineered last night were pure genius. Keep it up!
jeffymacleod::reminds me when twolves had the worst draft of the year when they drafted flynn and rubio. made no sense to waste that pick
TQ9475::They drafted lawson that same draft too. lmao.  wtf?
coloradoxplant::MANIMAL!!!!!!!!!
jeffymacleod::i think its funny how kings fans actually think the franchise has any real hope. they won't make the playoffs for atleast another 5 years. the rockets can make the playoffs with average talent and the nuggets, but the kings will always underacheive
SouthStander132::Faried &gt; MElo
Broncman17::To lose this one would have been catastrophic, erased what we did in Texas. I'll take a little bit of luck whenever it comes our way. Ty is really steppin up his game along with AAA. And Birdman seems to be energized again! let's get at least 6-7 of the remaining home games and we'll be on our way. Go Nuggs!!
SouthStander132::Agreed.  It was an UGLY win against a weak team, but you gotta love how that team hung in there and fought to the end.  Looking forward to Gallo and Nene getting re-integrated into the lineup so we can get some of our depth back.  GO NUGGETS!!!
Leap_JRH::Meow... meow... MEEEEEEEEEEEOW!!!! ... Kitties are mad right now... don't slip up cuz we're winning a lot of games down the stretch.
airlogan23::uhhh do i smell playoff cinderella?
Leap_JRH::Meow.
TQ9475::Meow lets not get ahead of ourselves meow
oguhmas::AAA more clutch than CP3 last night. Both had 3 free throws to tie at the end of the game.
phatty3327::who needs a closer... we got two!
28denverfan::I think Monty Mccutchen has something against the Denver Nuggets...........did anyone from denver sleep with his wife???
jayeteee::Maybe Kobe did on one of his visits here. :)
28denverfan::All year George Karl has been giving the ball to Miller and Harrington for the final shot....I think he should just leave it to the young, superstars in the making, players ( afflalo and lawson ) rather than veterans
emaldonado864::I agree totally.  Karl seems to stick with Harrington and Miller no matter what.  I think Karl should have a much quicker leash on these guys.
28denverfan::Also i dont think i have ever seen so many bench players in the game while it is so close and in overtime.......I mean Faried, Miller, and Harrington
Eric6203::Looks like Ty is playing for that new contract.   I liked his tweet about wanting to be the best.  I wish players would always play they way they do during a contract year.  Let's hope Ty does not turn into the passive Ty after the Nuggets give him the new contract.
jayeteee::Thanks for the gift wrapped V, Kings. Hope we never return the favor. Good to see AAA get back his groove, but we got to protect HC better next 8 games. Go Nuggets!!!!!!
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::GG Nuggs, GN all. GO KINGS!
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::did you leave jeff? you realize how dumb you sounded?
Jasonwengh::ok the board has died down and my eyes hurt. Hopefully this is the last post for this game so it stays on top.If I die tonight..I want the world to know one thing: -Marcus Thornton is a match fixer and he lpost this game for the kings.please dont ever forget this good people!
Jasonwengh::how many times do I have to tell you?I didnt bet on the kings.Someone blantantly sells his team out and you support him?Some kings fan you are.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::lol
Jasonwengh::lmao why are you hanging around a dead board?I'm so angry over this,i'm going to compile a blacklist of corrupt NBA players..starting with Marcus "Bookmaker" Thornton. Have a good night.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::you obviousy lost a bet because of him because you won't shut up about him
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::lol give it up, he just made a stupid foul
YodaSucks::atleast you arent blaming it on Fredette, and for that i thank you Thornton.
JustineS04::Ok kids, goodnight.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::gn
Jasonwengh::Lawton played great, but it's an absolute DISGRACE that Thornton will be forever listed by ESPN as a "top performer"  tonight, when he actually lost the game for the kings.Yeah I know he scord 27 points, but he also took a lot of shots and is a below average shooter.F*ck you Thornton!
Psychrates::Him AND Evans For Rondo, 1st rder.
largetomatoes::What do you guys think the chances are that Faried and Nene will start together with mozgov on the bench?
Jasonwengh::theres a good chance
jeffymacleod::tyreke and cousins for humphries and dwill is a trade the kings should push for. he would keep cousins in check make him a better player than he is and lead that team to the second round next year
chadwi12::sure u did
jeffymacleod::my bad, meant evans and thorton and thompson for dwill and humphries.
Psychrates::$@%! you, son. NEVER trade boogie.
YodaSucks::maybe we should draw him a picture, he might understand then.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::NJ gets: T. Evans &amp; D Cousins Kings get:D Williams &amp; K Humphries Cousins is a NJN, Williams is a SAC. Get it yet?
jeffymacleod::uh theyd trade for him idiot. why dont you read a sentence before commenting. anyone with bball iq can see that the kings will not be able to go to the playoffs any time soon. and evans is not going to be the leader they need
YodaSucks::How about you read your original post? You said they should trade "Tyreke and cousins for humphries and dwill"....that trade would put them on different teams. Or is my bball iq flawed? I'm pretty sure its just that you wrote something that makes no sense.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::you said evans/dmc for hump/dwill is a trade the kings should do so dwill can keep dmc in check. yet he would be a net, do you get why you sounded stupid yet?
YodaSucks::So, Dwill will keep DMC in check......while they are on separate teams. You sir are a genius.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::just what I was thinking
jeffymacleod::to provide much needed veteran leadership. dmc is not capable of being mature anytime soon and tyreke will never be the pg that they envision him to be. he is a lesser version of westbrook
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::evans is more of a sg/sf, he isn't even starting a pg anymore
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::so you want to trade dmc to get dwill so he can keep dmc in check? what?
jeffymacleod::the wizards and the kings are similar franchises. both have score first pg's and both have no future
Jasonwengh::also Howard
Jasonwengh::they had michael jordan as well and made the playoffs dont forget
jeffymacleod::when have they been good besides the webber and bibby era? they need a veteran presence, to young and you end up having bums like cousins lead a team
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::dmc is not a bum lol. yeah they need vets on this team to help the young players like dmc
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::the kings have a good future
jeffymacleod::kings should trade cousins and fridette for a legit star, maybe dwight howard if they were smart to boost ticket sales and keep a struggling franchise at home. then trade tyreke evans and thornton and first rounder thompson for d williams
YodaSucks::*fredette
jeffymacleod::and dwill and dwight would stay if together cuz all theyd need is some extra complimentary peices. never will happen cuz dwill is going to be a mav next year
jeffymacleod::yea, atleast theyd sell tickets and keep the franchise in sac. without the nba being like the mlb and taking control of the situation to ensure another franchise doesn't move.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::they are going to stay in sac
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::so they should destroy their roster for dwill and d12 and hope they don't leave?
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::The kings show flashes of what they can become, then can get blown out the next game. Youngest team in the NBA for a reason
jeffymacleod::yea and hes already a whiner. hes got talent but no work ethic. hes like a wannabe josh smith and smith is barely qualifies as a star
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::he isn't getting traded and shouldn't be traded
jeffymacleod::only reason he got fired is cuz the kings record was garbage. cousins is a tween power foward that will end up being a lesser version of derric coleman
Psychrates::Jeff is on Crack. I see a mean C-Webb with more post up skills, and a 3pt shot.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::lol no. He is going to be a beast, just takes time. its his 2nd year in the nba still
jeffymacleod::trade cousins for a much needed veteran, lets say louis scola or someone of that nature and a first rounder. guys headcase
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::hell no, a guy with that much talent ain't getting away. they fired a coach to keep him, he is 3rd in the nba in double doubles and has more charges than every other player this season.
DenverDiehard35::If AAA plays like that all year, gallo and nene return to form and faried doesnt let up.... we wont lose more than 5 games the rest of the year
phatty3327::of course you trade away your support cast for a star.  Look how good NYC is doing.
twodaysfast::jeffymacleod, that may be the most nonsense I have EVER read here on these boards.  Wow, and I mean WOW.
jeffymacleod::if youre depending on aaron afflalo to be your go to guy, denver is one and done in the first round. they need to trade gallinari, nene, and the rest of their above average team for a star
jayeteee::Hey, South, are you thinking what I'm thinking? This jeffy is a real clown.
SouthStander132::LMAO
JustineS04::If AAA keeps this up, he can be a go to guy. No complaints here.
DenverDiehard35::gallo and ty are the go to guys. not afflalo
tstruckzies6024::What a game.
OptimusPrime4.0::Wow i feel really bad for the people that bet for the Kings on this game... y'all must be hurting
JustineS04::Didn't they cover?
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::this kings team can be really good or really bad, and can make stupid mistakes because they are so young. People who bet on kings games are stupid
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::Thornton is a game fixer lol
DenverDiehard35::I decided im gonna make a fake account thats a woman just to laugh at how thirsty men are
JustineS04::Your grammar is far above average for these boards.
JustineS04::Nice.
DenverDiehard35::lah dee dah
JustineS04::Post a picture though. Never fails. I've seen guys all over that one Arizona fan.
DenverDiehard35::haha ya, but im not good at talking like one. i have to learn to capitalize, use proper grammar and be nice
JustineS04::No, as a girl. Find a fake one.
DenverDiehard35::haha i should...but thats what twitter is for. i like to keep this thread and my twitter separate so i can say dumb stuff on here and not have them used against me later lol
JustineS04::This is the first time anyone's ever said anything. Thornton really got to that guy.
JustineS04::Really? I must've missed it then. Probably too busy cursing Dre.
DenverDiehard35::and i dont think thats true lol i know i have jokingly said stuff to you before
JustineS04::I didn't even do anything!
DenverDiehard35::you have inspired me. im not usually an attention person but thats too funny.
JustineS04::Can't sleep. Too much adrenaline left over from this game.
OptimusPrime4.0::are you high off meth Justine?
OptimusPrime4.0::no its not
JustineS04::Birdman, is that you?
DenverDiehard35::me too sista
TubbyTime334::Faried Should Be The New Old Spice Man.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::lol
DenverDiehard35::faried should be the new head and shoulders guy
OptimusPrime4.0::The kings coach is the worse when it comes to substituting he's players in and out of the game
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::he is terrible at time management for players. Jimmer jockeys think he is racist for the amount of time he gets when really he just sucks to give players the right amount of time
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::what this kings needs. some good veteran players and some team defense. they have some good individual defenders but as a team they blow
Astro_Dawg::Yeah Tyreke needs to learn how to switch on defense, left Lawson wide open.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::wide open
Astro_Dawg::Thornton should hot have even been in with 5 fouls at the end.  Not only did he screw up and send a guy to the line with 0.6 seconds left, but he fouled out so he wasn't available for OT.  Dumb move by Coach "Smart" imho.
OptimusPrime4.0::Reason afflalo made those 3 free throws is because he does yoga
helmsey::He had 6 points in the last 10 seconds of regulation.  Not quite Reggie Miller but still pretty impressive.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::is tat boy still here?
GerardoE303::should i eat ramen noodles or make a sandwich before i go to work?
helmsey::Eat spoonfuls of Peanut Butter and Nutella.  Tastes like a Reece's
GerardoE303::haha
DenverDiehard35::you should skip work
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::I'm back
DenverDiehard35::How long till Denver gets its own ESPN section? Im tired of scrolling and searching for denver sports news
twodaysfast::Sadly never.
GerardoE303::hopefully soon :)
JustineS04::Everyone hates Thornton. He made 6/9 from 3 point range. That's unreal. Without him, they're not in it.
helmsey::Kings have some good young talent.  They just have to figure out how to play as a team and learn how to "win".
helmsey::If you get the right veteran (like a Chauncey Billups) and/or a good coach that would help.
HappyHappyJoyJoy000::yep, we just make a lot of mistakes
helmsey::yeah, it was a pretty bad mental mistake at the end though.  i agree he was probably the mvp for the kings until that point.
JustineS04::Yeah, I always feel kinda bad when that happens.
DenverDiehard35::If I ever feel like there needs to be another white rapper Im gonna make a club banger talkin about ty lawson and manimal.
Tatted up crazy goon Nuggets fan::http://img1.classistatic.com/cps/l/kj/09/6/10/763/r2/08888m6_20.jpeg
JBurhenn253::Wasn't able to watch tonight and I see a lot of hate for Thornton. What did he do?
chadwi12::so he fouled him again  while he was shooting just to make sure... hahaha
JustineS04::Fouled AAA shooting a 3 to send it to OT.
helmsey::I couldn't see that with my crappy stream over the interweb
JustineS04::He did foul him while AAA was dribbling, but they no called it.
helmsey::eh, he shouldn't of been anywhere close to AAA.  either should have fouled him sooner or stayed back.  he'll learn from the mistake.
JBurhenn253::Oh okay, they'll get over it. Thanks guys
JustineS04::I mean, it wasn't as dumb as everyone made it sound. AAA drew contact.
JBurhenn253::Was it good defense or just blatant?
Jasonwengh::goodnight all..Justine ..I expect a message in my inbox when I check hun. nighty nite.*slaps ya $@%*
JustineS04::Sorry Jason. Don't hold your breath.
JustineS04::You know, they make actual websites devoted to what you're after Jason.
DenverDiehard35::yep. Craigslist: Men seeking men
DenverDiehard35::hahahaha youre my new favorite fan. idk even know what team u like but ur my favorite, thank u for making me feel good about myself
helmsey::Getting to see Nene play again after so long, I forgot how good he is at passing to cutters and running the court.   The problem is, Faried can put up the same number of points simply because of how hard he works.  If Nene worked as hard as Faried, he would be ridiculous offensively.
JustineS04::I forgot how good he is at finger rolls.
helmsey::haha... don't get me started on that
DenverDiehard35::Im still trying to figure out how AAA is "like a lightning bolt from a blue sky" like his twitter says
JustineS04::You gotta meditate on it. "close your eyes and see your visions."
JustineS04::I went, but I knew I didn't belong.
DenverDiehard35::100 pounds?! i dont mean to sound rude or nothin but u sure u ever went in a weight room cuz doesnt sound like u had much weight ha
JustineS04::That's awesome. I weighed 100 pounds. I was like, we can spend all day in here, and it won't make a difference.
DenverDiehard35::haha. he made us do it before practice but it kinda bit him in the a** bc one of our players fell asleep during it and nobody took it serious
JustineS04::Really? We never had to meditate in any sport. I couldn't stop laughing during weight workouts.
DenverDiehard35::im the worst meditator.... my coach forced my bball team to try it once this year and i couldnt stop laughin
Jasonwengh::ok one last thing to get through that thick headed moron nuggests goon  fan:if you give any joe blow the ball and give them 30 shots you think they cant score at least 27 points like Match fixer thornton?and they wouldnt have sold out at the end. goodnight
JustineS04::Not Andre Miller.
Tatted up crazy goon Nuggets fan::fu.ck , some lean till im kickstanding then sleep
Jasonwengh::ok im done. i've wasted too much time here.. goodnight everyone and just remember boycott match fixers!!!
Jasonwengh::you send send me a pic link in a private message ..babe ;)
Tatted up crazy goon Nuggets fan::here she just sent me this  http://img1.classistatic.com/cps/l/kj/09/6/10/763/r2/08888m6_20.jpeg
JustineS04::Nah, I'm fairly confident that you can find someone if you just refocus your Thornton rage.
Jasonwengh::she told me .I guess she likes me better than you :P
YodaSucks::pics or it didnt happen
JustineS04::Nah, I'm happy with the way I look.
Tatted up crazy goon Nuggets fan::that you know how to use google search to find a girl you wish you looked like lol
JustineS04::I wonder what you guys would think if I posted a picture, which I'm not dumb enough to do.
DenverDiehard35::hahahahahahahahaha
Tatted up crazy goon Nuggets fan::lmao, she probably told you that knowing she look like donkey kongs sister
Jasonwengh::shes not. shes slim and has DD's.i'd hit it
Tatted up crazy goon Nuggets fan::how you know?
Jasonwengh::i'd still date you regardless
Tatted up crazy goon Nuggets fan::what if she ugly?
Jasonwengh::I thought you were.anyway goodnight
JustineS04::Sorry to disappoint.
Jasonwengh::Justine are you african american hun?
JustineS04::No, why?
naddarians::If u need help u know who to call Rashard Lewis
JustineS04::Goodnight. Feel better.
helmsey::I didn't realize you could freeze a player by calling a TO in the MIDDLE of FT attempts.  Really weird that that is legal.
JustineS04::For example, "continue on .... when you believed it you did it even if you have yet to do it"
helmsey::whoa.  that it some serious zen buddhist shizzle.  or Deep Thoughts by Aaron Afflalo
naddarians::The rule was put in place because refs had to drop Rashard Lewis's 99% free throw percentage and the way they did it was by screwing up his rhythme
JustineS04::AAA is so Zen. Have you read his twitter feed? It's all deep thoughts like Run's blackberrying at the end of an episode.
JustineS04::https://twitter.com/#!/arronafflalo
helmsey::that's awesome.... I'll have to check out his tweets.  he looked so calm during the FT it looked like he could fall asleep
