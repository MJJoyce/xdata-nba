Jeremy Lugo::With Pop and company,  as always,  they have a great team.  Keep the winnings going, GOOOOO!!!!! SPURS!!!!! GOOOOO!!!!!
Jeremy Lugo::Ways*
Spencer Gerrity::come on spurs,  win by 5 or more
Spencer Gerrity::bingo
Steve Broome::Kinda cool to see Duncan responding so well to those years of Popovich giving him extra rest by still being so effective late in his career.
Ayn Bland::WOOPS!  I do believe that was a changing of the guard.  It's about time to put Timmy on an ice floe, doncha think?
Chris Glade::Timmy scored more points per minute and had more rebounds per minute than Davis... on the second night of a back-to-back. Jus' sayin'.
Randy Dixon::Manu is a complete turnover machine...stop giving his A$$ the ball
SirBeast Fiftybuc::u dont complain when he does his euro step and score for u though
Mike Wagener::Pelicans are a good young team, not an easy matchup for the SPURS.  Also, I like their young coach, Monte WIlliams, a SA Spurs product.    GO SPURS!
Casiano Servaz Tubana III::Most of us sad Pelicans fans want Williams gone ASAP. He has done nothing to be our long-term coach..
Brett Goldman::That is just silly, lost the spread and the over by a combined 1 point..fml
Franz Atencia::Pelican's best days are yet to come...but for now Spurs rule the West
Las Vegas IM::San Antonio is 1-4 ATS in its last 5 games when playing New Orleans
Mark Allen Fontana::WHAT HAPPENED TO DAVIS DID HE GET HURT
Ikenna Nwaghanata::If my Pelicans win this game, I'll eat my hat.
Marcleen Bavogui::tired legs after yesterday ...
SirBeast Fiftybuc::garbage foul on davis
Mike Wagener::nice win by the SPURS!
Charles Cherry::spurs by ten??
