sautan::the ref won the game for IND. But no worry, refs couldn't help even they want to when Lakers visit.
Taco with a Q::Ref won dick!  That was a clear foul on Hill
LuckandTheIrish12::You're an idiot. The call was legit and it's stupid to suggest refs not make calls just because of the time of the game.

fosterwhitlock::Hopefully Gerald Green will be out of the rotation by the time Danny Granger gets back
MasterOfLogic::Pg had a bad offensive night and was one assist away from a triple-double... insane.
TimeWarp.::Memphis needs to fire Hollinger. Ever since they hired him they suck. Before that they were playing great. LOL

Cheeto Fangaz::You must be $@%!$@%! then.
AC130Time1::I like how everybody is concerned about the Celtics not making the playoffs when they had a worse record last year at this point... Everyone should know by now that the C's start slow and then they get the 4th/5th seed, it's common sense.
ReppinRed84::Nobody cares about your old, washed up Celtics.

matt25485::shut up
matt25485::Pacers are now a 1/2 game out of the 2 spot in the east with the knicks loss
hoops 112hoping::yeah but the bricklyn nets are also a 1/2 game behind us for the 3rd spot
0811bluenation18::paul george or tyler hansborough
ReppinRed84::Oh, at playing Madden? ........ Paul George
hoops 112hoping::rather be? Well I'd rather be the rising superstar, Paul George.  No idea what you mean now... If it's who's better, then there's no question

Grindhouse2413::Oh and I hate it when we are on ESPN, I hate hearing Mullins talking about us. If he can get a job speaking for a living, he ll anyone can. He is bad luck to us.
Grindhouse2413::Zach - less outside jump shots, catch it deeper in the post/paint Marc - Man the F up and attack the basket, draw some fouls dude you shoot like 89% from FT TA - Keep playing your heart out, shoot less jump shots, keep practicing your lay ups Conley - less dribble more drive, push the pace and make your big guys hustle so they cant set up their D Rudy - CATCH AND SHOOT, your handles arent that good man, you get stripped too much, less TOs Bayless - Dude what happened to you? I know you can still shoot so is Coach telling you not to? Ellington/DA - Holding the bench down, proud of you guys LETS GO GRIZ!!
Grindhouse2413::thanks
adworak524::sir, that comment about ta practices his layups was rather comical
Lugene Parker::Perverbial nail on the head.  Nothing else needs to be said.
Grindhouse2413::Marc has had a double double 5 times this season and we have won all five times.....coincidence?
Rexanilatorz::I really love that Orlando Johnson took all of Gerald Greens 2nd half minutes
ReppinRed84::I don't. It's good that they're sending a message. But that means we're not getting value at of someone who was showing a LOT of promise last year.  Hope he wakes the hell up and finds his confidence.
bluewhitetitansfight::I'm not blaming the refs or anybody but the Grizzlies as Grizz fan: Mike Conley did something totally stupid, and Rudy Gay wasn't really thinking when he waited until after the buzzer sounded to shoot the game winner. Totally ruined the great game that Tony Allen was having defensively and the way Wayne Ellington was playing. Good game to the Pacers... good luck with the rest of your season. It's good to see other teams but the Heat playing good ball in the East.
hoops 112hoping::Grizzlies are a great team but their offense needs some work. Same for the pacers but we have an easier solution to that: danny granger. Think Gasol and Z-Bo make it to the ASG and the Grizz finish 3rd or 4th in the west at the end of the year.
hoops 112hoping::As a pacers fan, respect for tony allen. Wow. You can have anyone on our roster except west and george, if he's available. Him and George could be the best defensive wing tandem of ALL TIME baby (k maybe just behind jordan and pippen)
Grindhouse2413::We never use a foul in final point scenarios. We had a foul to give! Also I am tired of seeing Bayless mess up a late shot clock play to end a quarter. So frustrating.
bluewhitetitansfight::Me too. He's been driving me crazy of late. He's not the shot creator Mike Conley is, and it seems to overwhelm him. We should trade HIM not Gay or Z-Bo.
Grindhouse2413::Just got home from the game. What an up and down game. Like 10 ties and 19 lead changes. Proud of TA for his hustle. Dam proud of Ellington for being more confident in his shot. I honestly blame Marc for this loss, what did he have like 6 points? WHAT!?!?! And $@%! man, Rudy took 22 shots and scored 14?!? Ugh. Hope we blow LA out again like earlier this season.
hoops 112hoping::well Tony Allen was incredible in the game, yeah. Marc Gasol idk they were giving it more to Z-Bo and Gasol wasn't too aggressive with this jumpshot. Paul George locked down rudy gay again.
matt25485::tonight will be one of the rare times i will root for the lakers, bulls need to go down again
Henry Rutabega::I think Vogel should start Mahinmi over Hibbert.
Momma Pete96::Hibbert hasn't been putting up big numbers recently, but if we didn't start him, the loss would definitely be felt.
Walter White Killed Don Draper::hibberts defensive presence is too good, his offensive will get better
CommitmentToExcellence1968::Ive been following a betting system called SportsBettingStar the last couple months now.  Im making around 3K per month just by following the system.
Henry Rutabega::Flag
0811bluenation18::tony allen hustles like he's at the ymca
hoops 112hoping::Paul George being more of a facilitator against the Grizzlies this season, averaging 17/8/7
RabbiLevine::Pacers were lucky to win this, but I'll take it, especially on the road.
flampoo::Not lucky. Good game plan. Solid defense.
royhibbertgoodkisser@yahoo.com::i didnt think the refs were as bad as a lot of people were saying. they did miss a couple of calls, but seemed to immediately call a make up call on the next possession. the george hill foul was a def foul though
bluewhitetitansfight::I'm a Grizzlies fan and I even think that George Hill foul in the last few seconds was an obvious foul. No denying it.
OlBoyP::pacers lost 3 quarters and still won. nice.
OlBoyP::for sure. its a good victory.
pedrobear1::Basically identical teams
Cryoniclime::it was pretty even all the way down to the last possession
Cryoniclime::it went pretty much as expected. two pretty much identical teams
OlBoyP::thats about how i expected this game to go. unfortunately i had to work today so i missed it.
CommitmentToExcellence1968::Ive been following a betting system called SportsBettingStar the last couple months now.  Im making around 3K per month just following the system.
KingJamesOwnsYourFavoritePlayer::stop gambling fool
coltsfan1989::NOBODY CARES! GET LOST TROLL!
pedrobear1::I'm surprised that there are no over reaction to the Memphis loss
PrinceoDarknesss::There was. About 45 min ago the boards were blowing up. Angry Memphis fans (myself included) at the ZBo no call, and Indiana fans bragging about the win and complaining about the Memphis fans. Then non Indiana or Memphis fans went on chatting, and the conversation changed
pedrobear1::oh i went to the fans boards and found what i was looking for
hoops 112hoping::Final 4 picks:  KU, Cuse, Michigan, and either Duke or Indiana.
BootyLoaf::and having michigan in the final four is appauling. they are the biggest pretenders. they havent even played a good team yet this season
BootyLoaf::aaron craft shuts him down every time they play. reason ohio state rejected him
hoops 112hoping::trey burke is AWESOME. mini chris paul
BootyLoaf::you cant predict a final four with no bracket out. for all you know those 4 could end up in the same region
BootyLoaf::michigan isnt even good... they are the biggest pretenders
Cryoniclime::yes I'm aware of how the ranking works and name calling really shows your maturity level.....and the way all of those teams have played there's just no reason to think any of them will slip down to a three seed
BootyLoaf::you're an idiot. all the way down to a three seed? 9th ranked team in the country gets a 3 seed. not that unrealstic one falls out of top 8. i expect michigan to be a 4 seed by end of season
Cryoniclime::lol those teams have never been out of the top ten there's absolutely no way any of them will get all the way down to a three seed
BootyLoaf::are you really saying that neither of these teams can be a 3 seed? you're a moron.  any of these teams can easily be out of the top 8 at the end of the season
Cryoniclime::no....just not gonna happen. maybe two will be in the same region as 1 and 2 seeds but that's it
BootyLoaf::never know dude. 3 of them could easily be.
Cryoniclime::all of those are potential number 1 seeds they won't end up in the same region lol
cbbaseball19::You left out Miami.....
hoops 112hoping::lol yeah i did
PrinceoDarknesss::Okay, let's talk playoffs. Conference finals matchups in both, who wins in how many, and who get's the the final. East, Heat vs. 3 seed (behind the healthy Chicago) Indiana. Heat in 7. West, OKC vs. LAC (top two seeds) OKC in 7. OKC wins the final in 7. Thoughts?
PrinceoDarknesss::Bulls are the third best defensive team in the NBA, their bigs are on a tear and all of this without the best offensive pg in the NBA. I don't think the old Knicks team can stay healthy, nor do I think that they keep raining the threes. I really think many of these series will go to seven based on how close a lot of the matchups for each team. Example: OKC vs. Memphis. Sefolosha and Allen are both primary defensive players, they cancel each other out. Conley is probably one of the only pgs in the league who can stay in front of Russ Westbrook. Durant owns Rudy. ZBo vs Ibaka is an intriguing matchup, but I will go with the double-double guy over Iblocka. Marc Gasol is better than any big OKC has. X-factor is Kevin Martin off the bench. He wins the Thunder one of the games, OKC wins the series
hoops 112hoping::They can't all be in 7, but i see what you mean. They will be close. Think the spurs could beat out the clips to get to the WCF (screw over CP3 again from getting to the conference finals, yes)
Cryoniclime::wait so you have pacers at 3, which means knicks will fall to 4 and bulls will completely bypass both of them? not gonna happen.. and heat were dominant in the finals nobody is stopping them unfortunately
Taco with a Q::Bulls arent winning jack
iammyfatherson::BootyLoaf - bulls will ra.pe them when rose comes back  an ohio fan why am i suprise
BootyLoaf::you'll see
hoops 112hoping::lol no way.
BootyLoaf::bulls will ra.pe them when rose comes back
BootyLoaf::bulls beat heat in 5 with rose. then get swept by thunder in finals
ReppinRed84::The Bulls won't do $h!t in the playoffs. Too much time off for Rose. There will be an adjustment period, and the way he constantly cuts and jump-stops (HUGE part of his game), I'd be surprised if he looks 70% like his old self this year, and maybe going forward.  I'm sure he's worked on his jump shot though, so that will help.
iammyfatherson::what are u smoking they couldnt even beat them in the playoffs before his injury but they will beat miami in 5 with  him coming back from an acl in 5 games?? u serious
Henry Rutabega::Indiana is going to pull off the trifecta and win the NCAA, NBA and WNBA all within a calendar year.
coltsfan1989::Is the WNBA that important though? That's for the FAN to decide.
ericnicholson::says the guy who watches too much family guy ;)
hoops 112hoping::would be cool.
BootyLoaf::the WNBA only counts as a fourth. so you'd need 4 women sports teams to win it to hit the trifecta
Cryoniclime::I really hope so
Area55andG2::wow. the heat get a nice 6 day rest after playing LAL
Rexanilatorz::Yeah and earlier in the season they seriously had a week of rest between games
cbbaseball19::Yeah, they told Stern he better give them 6 straight days off!
heitz13::Pacers and Grizz have the same problem.  They can keep the game low, but somebody's gotta put the damn  ball in the hoop.  Don't know who can step up for the Grizz, I hope Granger has his shooting eye back quick for the Pacers.
colts8733::between, Paul George, Danny Granger, David West, and George Hill, I am sure the Pacers can find someone to put it in
cbbaseball19::Waaah Waaaaah.  Who cares if its not a big topic on ESPN.  Your team won.  Be happy about that.
smreilly22::I like your picture dude. You should be a supermodel.
Cryoniclime::you might be the most bitter person I've ever seen. especially over a regular season game
cbbaseball19::What is there to be bitter about? Im telling all the whiny Pacers fans that one tv time to quiet down.  They won.
BootyLoaf::blake!
cbbaseball19::Lets Get Weird!
