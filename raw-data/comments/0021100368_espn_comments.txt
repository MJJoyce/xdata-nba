rondomaniac9::do you think rondo will be an all-star?
sherrydogs2::Congratulations to Paul Pierce for passing Larry Bird.
jbarnes1621::When PP and Rondo combine for 23 assists, the C's will always be difficult to beat.
Rosstafarian5371::Seriously the Bobcats starting bigs couldn't come up with 10 combined points? Did Jordan even look at this roster when he put it together? Is Jordan the worst GM in the NBA? smh.
nba is the worst::The celtics chuckin' threes is hilarious - lucky for them Silas didn't give Brown (10-10 from the floor) more tick
Dwayne_Johnson23::Well when you're the best three point shooting team in the NBA . . . bombs away!
Dwayne_Johnson23::Apparently your favorite player shoots 100% every night
WhyUHatin47::So hot he could block out the sun. but then it gets too cold........DOUBLE SUN POOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
nba is the worst::Apparently - Pierce (2-10) was hot...
Dwayne_Johnson23::C's!
fhymson42::still cant believe we drafted larry hughes instead of pierce... Imagine iverson and pierce playing togethor in their primes... ugh.
marcpru60::wow how the mighty have fallen, celtics very old and the other team, well, stern should be embarrassed that bobcats in nba, really, something like soccer relegation should take place
AvengedByCats::I refuse to listen to someone who forgets words in their sentences.
34834439893::Yes we are old but we are still going strong......
34834439893::GO CELTICS GO!
raven.5200::3-22
34834439893::U MAD BRO?
Chris72077::Congrats Paul Pierce! Even though I am a Bobcats fan, I still enjoyed watching him whoop up on the lakers in 09 Finals I believe it was. I have always enjoyed watching him play
Jimmy30313::08 finals
cb12490::At 3-22, I have no silver linings, so at this point...  Kept it to only a 10 point game! Good loss, 'Cats!
Chris72077::Yeah at this point ill take it
kzwider::Knowshon Moreno is such a d-bag lol http://www.the-outfielder.com/2012/02/what-was-knowshon-thinking.html
arlenalmendinger24::kg is really looking good rite now
NBA_refs_are_weak::my favorite stat is 27 minutes. ill take that all day long
Rondo is the bum of bums::If Boston loses those games, you're in here right now saying that Boston sucks.
Chris72077::I think Albert Haynesworth and Jamarcus Russel definitely have Rondo beat as bum of all bums....
NBA_refs_are_weak::haha right? if you win you get no credit because they are awful, if you lose its the end of the world, must make roster changes immediately. pack it in for the season. how about, any win against a professional team is good, some are better than others of course, but winning is winning. if you lose? look at the what you did wrong that game and practice to improve it and move on to the next game. the world isnt saved/lost EVERY night. sometimes you need to look at things in perspective
raven.5200::Celtics still havent beat a good team.
Rondo is the bum of bums::Orlando twice, Pacers, Memphis, and others that were put on the schedule.
nba is the worst::Celtics are 1-2 vs the Pacers.  Magic's chemistry is gone, they're on hold. Celtics' biggest win is vs the Raptors...
Chris72077::orlando is definitely a good team though
MochaFlux::I think his definition of a good team is one that doesn't lose to the Celtics. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Txboy12345::Orlando isn't all that great, Pacers are ok until I see more grea wins and Memphis isn't as good with Gay in the lineup
The_Truth_That_Resides::JEREMY LIN IS A FIRST BALLOT HALL OF FAMER, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
DavidkK_T::You should be a comedian. This is the best joke I've heard today.
The_Truth_That_Resides::Its straight razzle dazzle from the blazin Asian. Making the Harvard Crimson proud. Making Chinese people everywhere forget about Yao Ming. Forget Chris Paul. J-Lin is here to run the show.
NBA_refs_are_weak::haha idk about all that, but I always enjoy watching someone flip off the status quo
Rondo is the bum of bums::Cam &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brady
NBA_refs_are_weak::10 for 10 for derrick brown? got damn. anyway, glad the C's didnt fall in this trap game. got a big one against the lakers thursday, figured since this was a home game they might not be as focused. got this one out of the way, time to bring down the nemesis
baziman 007::we will see what happens when the real season begins
baziman 007::definitely; any real fan knows that; they both need to go into the playoffs healthy with a set roster; i can't wait for this thursday; it will be fun ;)
NBA_refs_are_weak::yup. right now its about roster lineups and working out the kinks. just enjoy when we play the lakers, not just because its lakers/celtics but because of the mini history of these 2 rosters. you know both teams will get up to play this one
DNA and the I Ching::The Celtics are rising and the Lakers are falling.   Teams going in opposite directions.

DavidkK_T::Congrats to Paul Pierce! He's now #2 in Celtics' scoring list! And that's THE TRUTH!
Leibo282::Love what Pierce did tonight. Wrote an article to commemorate his top five career moments.   http://bostonsportsblog.net/2012/02/07/top-five-moments-of-the-truth/
Rondo is the bum of bums::Larry didn't like Magic that much until the end of their careers.
baziman 007::they respected each other; big difference
Rondo is the bum of bums::I agree with that 100 percent.
baziman 007::would you respect larry legend if he said i want to leave the celtics to play with magic and win rings?
Jganon93::and philly gots that number 1 D buddy
Rondo is the bum of bums::Boston will have the #1 defense when the stats are refreshed tomorrow.
Jganon93::yo home boy rondo is a bum, boston is going no where this year.
baziman 007::okc is a scary team though as are the pacers
Rondo is the bum of bums::Okc is scary, Pacers are overrated. They're a year away.
baziman 007::i hope so comrade; it would be nice to see who wins the best of 3 in terms of finals; i thought last yr we would meet each other but i guess we ran out of gas
Rondo is the bum of bums::D-bag fked up Rondo's elbow. That cost us the series.
baziman 007::btw, u guys gave up 2 superbowels on 2 flukey plays; unbelievable
Rondo is the bum of bums::I'm a Carolina fan when it comes to football. Cam &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brady
baziman 007::i think our teams will be in flux for a few yrs until the nba realizes they need them again
Rondo is the bum of bums::Boston and La will be fine. They may get back to the Finals this year if healthy.
baziman 007::yep; i always loved it when we played the celtics; it was just pure competition and war; it was a beauty to watch; it will never be reproduced because of the $$$ involved in the nba these days
Rondo is the bum of bums::The C's and Lakers have had some pretty good finals the past couple of years
baziman 007::i hate the celtics but i always respected them for their fight and desire to win; man the 80s was such a golden age; anyone who was there knows what i am talking about
Rondo is the bum of bums::I agree with you very much. Are you a lakers fans?
baziman 007::he aint a legend if he copped out and won that way; no true legend will respect that
Rondo is the bum of bums::that's why I said I'm glad he didn't do it
Rondo is the bum of bums::Yes, but he was a competitor. I'm glad he didn't do it.
Rondo is the bum of bums::DNA  It my thoughts, I say what i want.
Rondo is the bum of bums::I wish Larry and PP could've played together though. It would've been sweet.
Rondo is the bum of bums::To he honest though, Larry &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PP
Rondo is the bum of bums::I say that PP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Larry, but both are ny 2 favorite Celtics of all time. Both have underrated games that people took for granted and both were loyal to the C's.
DNA and the I Ching::Not even close.
Rondo is the bum of bums::Larry &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PP
Phil G 123::Celts on a rooooooll !!!
Jeff072092::Michael Jordan after the game... "I'm going to fix this.  I promise you.  Just hang in there with us this season.  I promise you, I will fix this."
DeWayne5783::Yay we suck! Watch Jordan draft some foreign bum in the draft, set us back some more years.
Jeff072092::And also that MJ finally changes the Bobcats name.
Jeff072092::I'm really hoping this is the year that doesn't happen.
baziman 007::gasol + fillers for rondo; who says no?
baziman 007::http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/7551496/larry-bird-love-play-los-angeles-lakers-kobe-bryant
baziman 007::can't wait until until 2034 cause thats when the celtics will win their next ring
baziman 007::Bird seriously dissed Lebron today&gt;&gt;&gt; " fun" to play with lebron but if u want to win go with Kobe!
Baseballbill1::And Lebron STILL won't have his
DNA and the I Ching::Gasol, Bynum, Bryant, Artest and Barnes for Rondo...mabye..but still that would be a steal for the Lakers.
Baseballbill1::Artest...that name sounds familiar...
baziman 007::absolutely
gt1master_ike::To think people thought the celtics would miss the playoffs this year.
baziman 007::EC is tuff this year
baziman 007::they won't miss the playoffs but won't make too much noise either
baziman 007::unfortunately they are still old and need to go thru pacers, bulls and or heat to just get to the finals
Rondo is the bum of bums::How do you know? #1 defense in the NBA and they're healthy.

freebird1963::well put lets see some pics for tomorrow before we put downt he money. Talk is cheap esp when your hiding behind a fake name. SHOW US THE MONEY B1TCHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
DaBostonStrangler10::Ok one last one.   UK_Basketball_for_life Rondo is the future. PP is fat.
patsfanallday413::rondo is very good, but this has been pierces' team for a long time now, he will be remembered as one of the best celtics ever
celtsfan91477::No way....Pierce is the 4th best Celtic of all time.  Bird, Russell, Hondo, then Pierce.
DaBostonStrangler10::Yep. Probably top 6 or top 7. You have to put Bird, McHale, Parish, Russell and Parish in front of him. After that it's a toss-up
DaBostonStrangler10::And by the way I am not trying to make Rondo look bad, because I love Rondo and he is probably the second most important player on this team. But people do take for granted how important Paul Pierce is to this team.
patsfanallday413::i wish he were here lol
DaBostonStrangler10::Me too
Rondo is the bum of bums::PP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rondo
DaBostonStrangler10::I agree with this. This is not yet Rondo's team. It is STILL Pierce's team. When Rondo went down, Pierce picked up the slack and starting bulking up on assists. And is continuing to do so while Rondo is working his way back.
Rondo is the bum of bums::Thank-you
Buzzard1127::Kemba Walker leading the Bobcats in rebounding!  Hahah
DaBostonStrangler10::UK_Basketball_for_life That's stupid. What has Pierce provided over the last two years other than passing the ball at the end of the shot clock? Pierce is refusing to let go of ownership of the team. Time to go. This is Rondo's team now: fast and efficient. If you want, please trade Rondo.
Rondo is the bum of bums::lol
patsfanallday413::haha
DaBostonStrangler10::Ok you're right. You didn't make those stupid comments, this idiot did.
DaBostonStrangler10::UK_Basketball_for_life Who is letting the C's down: Garnett and Pierce... Time to make some trades. ------------------------------------------------------------ Two weeks later, you are eating those words.....
DaBostonStrangler10::I can't help but post these comments from the Kentucky fan because they are so freeking dumb
patsfanallday413::hes not even here is he? lol
STR8REBEL::Happy the C's won tonight. I am glad to see Paul Pierce accomplish the goals he has achieved as a player for the Celtics.
supreme91::Celtics bandwagoners would say Pierce is  better than Bird
freebird1963::The only ones saying that are the 13yrs that didn't see the C's back then play.
DaBostonStrangler10::I know. It's the dumbest thing I've heard all night. Bird CHANGED THE GAME OF BASKETBALL with Magic Johnson. Bird, Magic, MJ, etc. are on a whole different level from this era of players. The only guy I'd consider throwing into that group of players is Kobe Bryant.
Jimmy30313::No celtics fan would say that
patsfanallday413::pierce is no larry bird, but he has meandt alot to the celtics organization
DaBostonStrangler10::Believe it or not, several Celtics fans said it earlier tonight.
Tom Brady is the most overrated system QB since Dilfer::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyNPeLJBo7Y
bballfool6::20 Likes and the Celtics win the nba finals!
caniac999::Not sure that is how it works...
bballfool6::only 18 more....
patsfanallday413::you mean these loyal new york fans lmao?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwvTPNMEEGI
Tom Brady is the most overrated system QB since Dilfer::LMAOOOOOOO! Jets fans &gt; Giants fans.
DNA and the I Ching::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CajmnNIbhyo&amp;feature=related  .
bballfool6::9 out of 10 baby!
celticfan9262::hats off to pierce in breaking the record loved the standing o he got he deserved it.the fans wanna see boston and tha lakers in the finals one more time.go celtics.

freebird1963::And your mom is the nut cleaner for the 18th street pimps
3KidneyJoe::You want to suck my what?
thebookshateme::doing a special today...buy 1 month at regular price get second free
3KidneyJoe::WooooHooooo 9 out of the last 10 games!
DaBostonStrangler10::This only proves that this is still Pierce's team, and when he gets hot, this team wins games.
pepe101245::Celtics wil win finals againt lakers this year.... Rondo will win MVP.
Tom Brady is the most overrated system QB since Dilfer::I'm sorry, is this the 1960's? The Celtics and Lakers would be lucky to make the playoffs.
DaBostonStrangler10::Next game against LA Thursday. Gonna be a great game.
patsfanallday413::i was joking around calling him fat, obviously hes not fat....but it is partly rondo's team, he is a huge part of their success
DaBostonStrangler10::You and that dumb Kentucky basketball fan said Pierce is done, and this is Rondo's team. You guys called Pierce fat and a donut. I told you guys SEVERAL times that Pierce would get better as the season went on, and you never listened. Who turned out to be right?
patsfanallday413::strangler, dont confuse what i said early on....i said they were a hard team to watch and they were, but i havent missed a single celtics game so far....the teams lackluster start most likely had alot to do with the lock-out
