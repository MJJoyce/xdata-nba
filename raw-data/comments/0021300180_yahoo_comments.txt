KEITH::another terrific game for Smith and Jennings, I am so glad we signed them.
two-seamer::Detroit has so much talent...but can they play together as a unit and learn to win??? I have them as a playoff team and could be very dangerous once May rolls around!
Ronald::Jennings is really a bad fit for this Piston team.
J.G. Wentworth::Pistons appear to be silently tanking this year. They should be better than their record, Mo Cheeks and Smith were bad signings.
Aha!::Mo Cheeks has been a disaster. Should have pulled the plug when he got investigated for dometic violence. Set a poor tone for the year
Cyril::Brandon "Brick Chucker" Jennings has attempted 37 shots in his last 2 games, while Greg Monroe has attempted only 17.  For all of his assists, Jennings is not doing a good job of running this team.    If you look at the schedule, the Pistons are 3-1 when Jennings takes 14 or fewer shots.  They are 0-6 when he shoots more than 15 times. He is at 37% now for the season, and is just 15-49 (30%) on three's.
dc::Millsap is better than Smith!  Go Hawks.
Jaye T::Great game Josh....glad you are finally out of Atlanta!
donald::Is that Josh Smith's picture on the milk carton?
Mohammed::pistons can't close out games, it sucks!!!!
