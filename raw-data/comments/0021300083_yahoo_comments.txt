gary::The cardiac kids win again. Entertaining group. Go Suns!
Dixon Cider::Nuggets are unintentionally tanking for wiggins
PKM::Ty Lawson is a baller, he is fun to root for even though I've never been to Colorado.
Truthbetold::Been a Cs fan for decades.....but this year I really like the construction and play of the Suns. Green, Plum......Bled....I love underdogs. You say...how can I be a Cs fan and love underdogs...Well back in 84 a slow, nonathletic group challenged the then all powerful Lakers..and guess what, they won. That's when I started following the Cs.  Hope the players on this Suns team continue to shine.
No Life Troll::Talk about an up and down 2nd half.
Gerry::Can we please have George Karl back as coach. If not him, the Adrian Dantley, who should have gotten the job over Shaw. Shaw is misusing the talent that he has. He should be runnin' & gunnin' on offese, especially at home.
donald::Any truth to the rumor that Denver offered Javale and a 1st rounder to Memphis for Koufos?  The only thing worse than signing that sack of ish to the big contract was not recognizing how useless he was and getting rid of him in the offseason
Stanley::Channing Frye = Why did they bring this no talent wimp back?
Mister E::The Suns finally woke up and realised they really DONT want to win games!!! HAHAHA
gary strong::I think I understand Jeff's tactic of playing his strongest guys in the second half and them NOT being the starters. They have played HUGE in the second half and worn down their opponents without playing the starters 37+ minutes like other teams. Non-traditional but effective. We'll see if it works throughout the season.
