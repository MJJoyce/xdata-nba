Mike M::With  solid development at their core, and a rash of trading, free agency, and drafting, the Pistons look to be on the road to repair. Kudos to new head coach Mo Cheeks, who seems to know just what  to do and who to play. It has taken a while to get them humming on all eight cylinders, but they have it going on now.
Michael::This was a preview of the Eastern Conference Finals 3 years from now if the C's shore up their defense in the paint.  Still in 1st with 55 to play
B::The difference right now between the Pistons and the Celtics is that the Celtics are maxing out on their potential while the Pistons are just scratching theirs. 3 more months and you could see a world of difference in this Piston team. I don't think the same can be said about the Celtics.
.8734::This is a bad Boston team. We could be looking at another 22 year drought.
Truthbetold::With all the talent Detroit has...I'm surprised at at their record.
Tritonmoon::Wow it's great to see Detroit  playing like a team learning to win. I'll bet this has a lot to do with Chauncey  being back on the team!
clint::Kentavious Cardwell-Pope, can't you come up with just initials or something shorter, "KCP" works for me.
tirthapada::Det is learning to close out games…then they will be tough…Green blew this one along with Boston team...
Arthur Buenaventura::Drummond better not be in foul trouble so early like last time
Purps & Gold::GG pistons, another great win
