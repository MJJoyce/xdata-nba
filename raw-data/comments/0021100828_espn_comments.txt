frazinat0r244::The 76ers bench &gt; their starters
KINGCAMBORAMBO::Dwight Howard is trying to be like Kevin Garnett because he  idolized him when he was a teenager.
Jaguarcrazyboy::Great win for Orlando. They were having a rough week needing a pick up.
KINGCAMBORAMBO::Following Dwight Howard high school successes, Howard chose to fore go college and declared for the 2004 NBA Draft—a decision partly inspired by his idol Kevin Garnett who had done the same in 1995—where the Orlando Magic selected him first overall over UConn junior Emeka Okafor.  He took the number 12 for his jersey, in part because it was the reverse of Garnett's 21 when he played for Minnesota.
TheMiamiVice::you have no life
KINGCAMBORAMBO::Dwight Howard is a Boston Celtics fan because he idolized Kevin Garnett when he was in his high school.
KINGCAMBORAMBO::Dwight Howard was a fan of Minnesota Timberwolves, and now he is a fan of Boston Celtics because he is a fan of KG and a fan whatever team KG plays for.

Mr Calogero::Orlando is a good team and it sucks they have to always worry about their coach and future of their organization only because one superstar player Dwight Howard. Some people need to grow up and make smart decisions. I hope the Magic get rid of him and start fresh with a new team looking forward.

TubbyTime334::That Was A Must Win For The Magic, And They Delivered.
TheCronoMasterMind::Thank you Magic for finally winning a game! The past week has been hard for me to watch, but I haven't missed a single minute of it yet. I'll watch through the good and the bad, but let's just hope the bad is behind us! Get it together, we need a good playoff run!
iliescu270::Sixers playing themselves right out of the playoffs!!!!!

MARINO84mvp::J.J. Redick &gt; Iggy
FunnyTacos934::Wow, Philly only has 2 home games left
ohedoh::Amazingly, John Hollinger both ranks the 76ers as the sixth best team in the NBA and still has a job.  He's a prolific buffoon, but a buffoon nonetheless.  John, how do you justify any system that gives this result when anyone who has ever watched a basketball game can see that the 76ers are struggling?
picaac15::Sixers lost to the Raptors by 21, have 2 days off. Expect them to come out angry and firing?  Nope, same 0 effort game.  Team needs changes now, the starting Lineup sucks
celticfan9262::THANK YOU ORLANDO.
CandySparker::Howard Lotta Love!
J-SMOOVE2048::Dwight Whorard
J-SMOOVE2048::Dwight Howard is a coward.
FeelinPhoggy::Wait, Dwight did something positive for Orlando? What is the world coming to?

vintageKRSblues::I rather be in the lottery than waste my time watching these bums in the playoffs. Hopeless
KENNETHPOWERS69::there is a good chance they can still miss out..
venator360::76ers-How do all five starters score 7 points or less yet three guys come off your bench and all score 15+? Kinda weird.
thekola::magic had starters and some backups playing against starters due to injuries but they had guys who doln't even play playing against the sixer backups
oreed luv his redsox::The Legend G.O.A.T is back   just stole your scal picture...!;)
parlaybeater702::I see a 76ers FREE FALL COMING NO PLAYOFFS FOR THESE BUMS
MAGIC11033::really like Glen Davis on our squad.  He fits in nicely.  Perhaps Ryno should be the one coming off the bench for a scoring punch and hustle.  Davis plays better D.
DTangMF::Need Davis backup the center position.
parlaybeater702::The 76ers couldn't beat Kentucky in a seven game series
jbean266::sorry buddy but I'm defiantly not dumb spelling mistakes don't show how intelligence you are how you answer question do case in point yourself
parlaybeater702::Are you really that dumb to not know when someone is making fun of you?
