tungcn2010::Kings need to put the Jimmer back into the starting lineup. Had a not so good rookie season, but he's ready now to be a superstar.
jeff050578::Vote David Lee for All Star
BearJWS::Loser.... Stop it with your pathetic posting on EVERY comment board.
Sir Faps Alot::way to beat the queens
Ryan8791::Stuckey isn't playing and the Pistons have won 5 of their last 6... The Celtics were willing to deal Rondo and Allen for Stuckey, Hamilton and Prince.... wow he should have pulled the trigger there.
happybuddha420::he's been a cancer? I wonder where you got that from
Ryan8791::Also I'd prefer Daye over Prince.. but that's just me
Ryan8791::I don't care what CV does or has done the last few games. He's been a cancer who couldn't guard a mannequin since he's been on the team. Stuckey isn't terrible I just don't think he fits in Detroit.
DetKoolAid::that is so dumb. stuckey was only out last couple games and its the reason why they have struggled to hold big leads late. Stuckey had improved a lot since moving to the bench and based on inflation stuckey is underpaid. your probably the same type of fan who wanted CV and Daye gone as well but now sing their praises since they have a chance to really succeed.   No PG on this team was going to succeed in the starting line up because there are no shooters and no slashers except for stuckey.
Ryan8791::Even if it was just barely on the rumor mill... I wish it would have happened. I hate Stuckey and the Prince deal is terrible too.
gcburns::So Drummond is now averaging 10 RPG in last 11, in just 23 mpg. That translates to leading league in rebounding. He needs to start playing 30 mpg sooner than later. Either play Monroe more PF or cut his minutes, Drummond has more positive impact on the game than Monroe with his defense.
dog_has_fleas::You sir, are high. So lets cut minutes of our best player because a young guy is playing well in his role. You know you sound like some of the Jimmer fans thinking if he plays more minutes then his numbers will jump when that isn't always true. They have Drummond in a good spot, why mess that up?
Go Google it::It's so peaceful in here. No hate.   Ahhhhh
ounlopez::Time to make Thomas come off the bench. Ferdette should start.
John40563::I'm not a fan of the Kings but I just saw highlights of Jimmer. That dude is a baller if u give him playing time and start him he will show u that just like he did for u guys and almost won u the game. He's got range too damn like from his BYU days.
dog_has_fleas::While he helped them get back into the game, he was also the reason they were in that hole. He can't stay in front of quick PGs like Brandon Knight and was abused. Luckily he turned on the switch in the 4th quarter and gave the Kings a chance but I think I am finally seeing why Smart won't start him.   He can shoot the lights out, but he may give all those points back on the other end. Still confused why T-Rob is getting weird minutes instead of James Johnson. Yeah he helped the team win a game, but lets not let that overshadow improving your team for the longterm. He can't get big in the middle, Robinson has shown he can.   I would gladly trade all 3 of our PGs for at least one that can play defense. I mean all three constantly get abused because of how small or slow they are.
gcburns::nm
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::DMC 21,14 Jimmer 4-10  Shut up
JamesZhou13::wtf if you watch the recap video on espn the commentator blames charlie v for the flagrant
gcburns::THey dont realize that I. Thomas charged in to CV 2 secs after whistle for no reason.
peeryman7::im a Pistons fan and I'm just thankful your coach sits jimmer all game he almost won it for you guys
dog_has_fleas::24 minutes is half of the game, how is that sitting him all game?
bigbluemaniac19::do the pistons possess a 1st round pick this year or is that the pick they traded to charlotte?
XstreamINsanity::If the Pistons are in the lottery, the Pistons own the pick.  Otherwise, it's Charlotte's.
russwilsonislegit::jimmer put two of the dirtiest cross overs and buckets on singlar and brandon knight..... wow
russwilsonislegit::im rewatching the fourth quarter.. that pass cousins gave fredette was awesome.....  kudos.... i thought it was johnson when i saw it in realtime
ChargersFan4Life001::dogs, you could ask huskies
-United We Run-::ask her
-United We Run-::Boogie, what was the new board called...i'll look it up on that website
ChargersFan4Life001::it was an nba board idk the name
russwilsonislegit::in the knicks game fredette had 15 points and 4 assist in the sec quater alone.. they were blowing them out.... he played approximately 4  min in the sec half and the won by 1 at the buzzer... tonight down 17.. he played the entire fourth.... cut the lead to 1 and pumped in 14.. again in one quarter...  i just dont understand why a first priority of a kings fan would be to take up for the guy who is fresh off a suspension for being a terrible team guy.... instead of getting this scoring maniac more min than a quarter a game so he can produce more of these 15 point quaters... jjust cont to boggle my mind
2bowdown::There aren't many who are calling Jimmer a superstar, but he has played to deserve more minutes.  The fact is that Jimmer ranks fifth among all PG's in player efficiency in the NBA.  He is in some pretty good company if you think about the PG's that make up the top 10.  I think he deserves a little more time to develop the "cold blood" needed to make game winners, but to say he needs to be benched and watch the game from the stands "with your children"  is a joke and only makes clear another joke which is your NBA IQ!!!
Markiemormon::Fredette had his chance to win big tonight and just like last years Jazz game he blew it.  The Kings don't need a player who get them close, they need someone who comes through with the win and in two years he never has.
Markiemormon::What is with you yimmer nuts?  One minute he's a super star and the next he's just a poor rookie who's doesn't know the game and needs a helping hand. With you as such a coddling parent your own kids probably have trouble standing on their own two feet.  I Thomas didn't need any of those crutches you provide for your children and so called super stars, he just went out and played his game like a man with no excuses.  Jimmer should be on the bench in crunch time or in the stands with your children until he learns the game.
purple-and-gold::In that Jazz game he got fouled. Sometimes calls don't go your way when you're on the road.  Plus, who the hell measures a rookie based on whether or not he can hit a game winner? That kind of responsibility you put on your veterans, not some kid just learning the pro game.
russwilsonislegit::i really get tired of cousins pouting on the floor to... and thats not because i solely like fredette as u would claim... its because i hate that type of team mate... i love nc state... and court side vs stanford i was screaming at cj leslie to stop fffffn pouting and to take over the damn game... so just because im a fredette fan.. im  not blind... i feel i always give credit when its due... its just rarely due
russwilsonislegit::i dont only.... i have had no reason yet to spread my love... i want to.. i thought id have kings rugs in my sports room by now..... but i can't....  i just dont understand why its not happening by now... i told u a year a go how good fredette was gonna be even in the NBA... u thought i was crazy... i said starter/all star material... u said bench scorer... i feel like fredette has proved my hypothesis accurate, and yet he is still not getting a shot... playing the same measely min as last year.... he has outplayed brooks and thomas both... his defense is better.... and he has been so solid.. yet nothing... i want u kings fans to get fffffffn rowdy and get my boy some starter min.. he has deserved it.... now get on it.. so i can get my kings rugs...  tooshay (no clue how to spell it) on the he had an argument with the idiot comment... that being said, i think smart has been such an idiot due largely in part to him truing to cater to cousins....
ChargersFan4Life001::1.he was suspended for arguing with the idiot, not being a bad teammate. 2. ive said that jimmer deserves time so im also supporting him 3.u r a jimmer fan and only care about him
ChargersFan4Life001::i didnt save it dogs
KokeTookHisTalentsToSouthBeach::Where the peeps at?
-United We Run-::what the hell
ChargersFan4Life001::who knows?
-United We Run-::why did we change it then?
ChargersFan4Life001::its a new nba convo board i think kobe bean made it
-United We Run-::Who made the new board boogie?
KokeTookHisTalentsToSouthBeach::What board?
ChargersFan4Life001::new board
ChargersFan4Life001::idk the new board
-United We Run-::How do you know there is a new board then?
ChargersFan4Life001::i forgot to save it
KokeTookHisTalentsToSouthBeach::.

KokeTookHisTalentsToSouthBeach::LOL?
-United We Run-::Why have you been such a b-tch lately?
KokeTookHisTalentsToSouthBeach::Yo
-United We Run-::Boogie, link the new board
-United We Run-::are you a Rubio fan boogie?
ChargersFan4Life001::not really but he is fun to watch
ChargersFan4Life001::he's awesome.
-United We Run-::why are you a fan of Rondo?
ChargersFan4Life001::its not that i dont like him, im just not a fan like i am for rondo
-United We Run-::so why dont you like him?
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::Is rondo on your fantasy team starting?
-United We Run-::RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUBIO is starting on my team too
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::Exactly Dogs. Happy New Year and RONDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
-United We Run-::yes
JimDetroitFan95::Charlie V got screwed in this game...........
ChargersFan4Life001::yep
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::Done being a douch   e. Good Night and Happy New Year to ALL.  Rondo runs the league and DMC is the next best thing.
russwilsonislegit::ur not a $@%!$@... boogie is tho... u should re think calling him a cat u root for
gcburns::Rondo is way better than Rubio, Rondo might be best defensive PG in league history and scores way more efficiently
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::I love this guy. Happy New Year.
smackdab0::he was the next best thing 2 years ago, now he's just the next latrelle sprewell.
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::Go back to your hole circa 1198
ChargersFan4Life001::gn UK, happy new year RONDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ChargersFan4Life001::ty u2
ChargersFan4Life001::no im a rondo fan
-United We Run-::You like the Celtics now?
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::Happy New Year Boogie and GL to your sports' teams in 2013.
-United We Run-::Rubio?
-United We Run-::RUBIO
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::RONDO
gcburns::If you look at Drummonds rebounding stats last 8 games per 40 minutes it would be around 19/game. He is going to be an insane bad $@%.
mngmikes::is this like every squirrel finds a nut once and a while thing or are the pistons really turning it around?
ZennMasterLurch::I think it goes...even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and then
ChargersFan4Life001::5 of 6, they are playing a lot better
quannage::Nice to see the Pistons playing better. they are improving as a team as the season goes on. Possible playoff push at the end of the season? one can only hope.
ChargersFan4Life001::1-4 without cuz 10-16 with him so it looks like they are better with cousins(not saying they are great, but still better)
russwilsonislegit::dude does it make u feel better about ur boogie obsession to say he needs to come to boston and then here some one who once had their espn tag as boogie scream no he is staying.. does that make u feel better about liking this guy.... it doesnt change the fact he is a bad dude to try to explain to ur little boy why he is the type of guy u root for.. as for u screaming he needs to go to boston... it doesnt change the fact that u have no pull whatsoever where he goes.... so might as well just chill
razzledazzletj81::with time expiring.
russwilsonislegit::ok then... the problem is fredette doesnt see big min when he has been out... i just wish cousins would stop trying to freeze him out and they would play together
ChargersFan4Life001::a 3 on a cousins pass
ChargersFan4Life001::he's given jimmer a 3 each of the last 2 games, and was cheering him on when he made shots. jimmer deserves good min but the team doesnt hate him
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::I'm a Mormon. It's obvious he needs to be traded to Boston.
russwilsonislegit::who
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::It is.
ChargersFan4Life001::no
ZennMasterLurch::Nice win streak boys!!  Keep it going
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::I love new posters.
ChargersFan4Life001::McGee for 3 LOL
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::APete will end up as the best RB of all time.
JimDetroitFan95::AD..... Get it $@%!$@%?
-United We Run-::*player
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::I won't go there yet.
Grantox::gonna be tough to top barry sanders!
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::You are too new here.
gcburns::UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE - GC, it's obvious that you don't get the audience here.  Uh, thats fine. Your audience consists of people recycling the same thought. Nice.
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::GC, it's obvious that you don't get the audience here.
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::AP can do it.
gcburns::I agree. I dont understand this guy though. He's posting this on a Sac vs. Detroit NBA game thread
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::United, would you have rather watched AP break the record or the Vikings make the playoffs?
Grantox::break record cause vikings wont get far in playoffs
-United We Run-::Idk, I was thinking the same thing
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::So was I. So sad.
-United We Run-::Boogie, are you Peter Griffin?
ChargersFan4Life001::maybe
-United We Run-::*yes
Ro-playah::Santa Cruz California Pistons fan since 1989 here! Pistons fan 4 ever! Keep it going ma Deeeetroit Pistons! We shall be back soooon!!!
gcburns::Next year, easily playoff team. Hell in this rotten conf. I could see us finishing as high as #4 next year.
-United We Run-::Koke?
ChargersFan4Life001::chad you are a jimmer fan. you get mad if a guy got a jimmer pass and doesnt shoot for the assist. the kings could go 0-82 and all you would say is "jimmer needs to shoot more and play more"
russwilsonislegit::not true
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::See Boogie, No one in your metro area or Utah wants DMC on the Kings. He needs to come to Boston with Rondo.
russwilsonislegit::cause he is doing wonders in sacramento
ChargersFan4Life001::no he needs to stay
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::Take PP and JS too
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::Yes. Please take AB for DMC
ChargersFan4Life001::for bradley?
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::No, NO, Listen to these intelligent fans...
---LeTs gO mAvS---::I want Cousins on the Mavs so bad
russwilsonislegit::i just in case u missed this, i didnt want u running off thinking that it was cousins actually play that i thought cost them...  so im posting again..   chargers u are awfully nieve..... even if BOOGIE didnt do anything play wise to kill their chances... u are putting him back out there with brooks, who had been lobbying to the point the media caught wind of it, to get removed from the starting lineup... and it worked.... and fredette who he will not pass to hardly ever..... those are the two that brought the kings back on this night..... and the min cousins enters u dont think that high that they are playing on just evaporates... say what u want, i know he didnt nessasarily cost them with his play... but i dont buy any means think its a coincidence that the min he checked back in, the steamrolling comeback stopped..
russwilsonislegit::and to ur point about the GM's im not claiming to know much about their thinking, but if they had seen every game this year and included attitude into the equation, although i think most if not all would take a cousins over jimmer..  i would have to think jimmer is making up ground... cousins cant even get along with a coach who has done everything to cater solely to him....  i cant imagine any team with a history of winning wanting to bring this guy into their fold... he is a cancer... but hey the bulls made it work with rodman... the pats with moss.. but i truly think this guy is on another level... he is just rotten to the core
russwilsonislegit::thats about their normal rec correct
russwilsonislegit::how many wins is that exactly..... one win came wow his rotten ace was suspended... so u cant count that one... and u r truly classy... taking ur comments to jack offs and porn related area's.. do we have a little problem perhaps... keep taking up for cousins tho... he has a real winning personality.. im sure ur gonna selll a lot of people on him
ChargersFan4Life001::and 4 losses, 1-4 when he is out
gcburns::I dont get the argument, they can both play. No GM in their right mind would take Jimmer over Cousins though.
j_erick11::The argument is not about who is better, or who would you rather have. It is about Cousins' attitude and how he plays with his team.We don't really understand what is going, but the whole team needs each other to win games. Jimmer has proved his worth so far this season, and Cousins has had good games, if the team can put it together they'll win some games until then it ain't happenin.
ChargersFan4Life001::he is a jimmer fan
ChargersFan4Life001::he was brought in to rebound the ft, then he was in cause he was getting O rebs and was playing great. The reason they lost cause brooks made a dumb TO and 2 dumb fouls
russwilsonislegit::ok... im wrong u win
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::You are NAIVE. See. DMC is the reason for many wins thus far. Jimmer is your porn.
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::The Year by AP was amazing.....  But, don't hate me. MVP to Peyton
russwilsonislegit::and chargers to ur point about if it wasnt for cousins the kings would have lost by 15..... No with cousins they lost by 9... that was his plus minus... with him off the court... they came back and won the min he wasnt out there..  so i dont get how u could say that
russwilsonislegit::yea its only what the team does in ur time on the floor.. it can be overrated... like jimmers is -5 but thats only because in the first half he got stuck playing his min with cousins
russwilsonislegit::nice... well done.... go jack off to jimmer... i see why u like boogie... ur his kind of people..
russwilsonislegit::what......
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::No, I respond to Chad. You must be new to this board.
gcburns::+/- represents Cousins with 4 other players, not just him. That point doesnt make sense. No doubt Kings lose by more without Cousins in my opinion.
ChargersFan4Life001::+/- is overrated.
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::Go jack off to Jimmer
JimDetroitFan95::AD is a stud, no question.  That being said, Barry was crazy good with no offensive line for years.
gcburns::And Barry Sanders was easily the most entertaining RB ever. Hey, this is entertainment business.
ChargersFan4Life001::It's gonna be hard for anybody to top barry, i really wish he would have played longer cause he was so good. AP might get there but right now no
TheFinalPlay::Cant compare AP to Sanders until his career is done
JimDetroitFan95::I can, and I did.  AD, not AP.
LetsGoTigers84::1.) AP 2.) Megatron 3.) Manning
ChargersFan4Life001::wow iggy sucks at fts
-United We Run-::Adrian Peterson is the best *player* ever
gcburns::Yeah, go to a freakin football board. No one cares.
ChargersFan4Life001::STOP IT!
ChargersFan4Life001::AP is the MVP tho
TheFinalPlay::1. AP 2. Manning 3. Brady 4. Megatron
ChargersFan4Life001::i agree
TheFinalPlay::Rodgers is 5. for me but I don't really know how well he did this year. He seemed to be under the radar all year long.
TheFinalPlay::If the Lions had a better year he would be number 3, but the 4-12 record hurts him.
ChargersFan4Life001::i'd have rodgers 3 or 4
ChargersFan4Life001::megatron deserves a top 5 spot
itsatrap123::I'm not sure he'll win but he is what the award epitomizes in my honest opinion.
ChargersFan4Life001::yep, voters can be stupid
itsatrap123::Like I said, I think he should win. I don't know if he will. Sportswriters are weird, you know? lol
ChargersFan4Life001::broncos playoffs last year, not min
itsatrap123::Exactly.
ChargersFan4Life001::you take him and PM off those teams and you can tell that the Broncos are def better
UK LOVES BASKETBALL FOR LIFE::APete is the best ever and everyone will know this soon.
gcburns::Like I said, B. Sanders got his yards on his own more so than AP does. So I'm sure AP will have people in his corner on that debate but I think more people will always ultimately say B. Sanders.
JimDetroitFan95::He is great, no doubt.  Did you ever watch Barry Sanders play?  I say Barry is the best I have ever seen play.
ChargersFan4Life001::maybe later
JimDetroitFan95::The Pistons are winning and Stuckey isn't playing.......  Just an observation.
iVoted4Kodos.::There... somebody said it.
russwilsonislegit::chargers u are awfully nieve.....  even if BOOGIE didnt do anything play wise to kill their chances... u are putting him back out there with brooks, who had been lobbying to the point the media caught wind of it, to get removed from the starting lineup... and it worked.... and fredette who he will not pass to hardly ever..... those are the two that brought the kings back on this night..... and the min cousins enters u dont think that high that they are playing on just evaporates... say what u want, i know he didnt nessasarily cost them with his play... but i dont buy any means think its a coincidence that the min he checked back in, the steamrolling comeback stopped..
russwilsonislegit::its also by no coincidence that fredette was 0-4 in the first with boogie on the floor.... 4 for 4 with him on the pine... then 0 for 2 at the end... when u know someone is gonna be lip smacking and pouting no matter what u do, it makes u play so much different... cousins is a team killer... ive played enough ball to know when i see one.... he is the kings mojo murderer... he can change.. randolph, and rasheed did.... but he needs to get the f on it
