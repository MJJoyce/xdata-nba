Jeffrey Nicholas::I thought for sure before the season that the Magic would mesh well enough to snag the eight seed in what i thought would be a more competitive conference than this.  Surprised that getting Harris and Davis back didn't fix alot of their problems as Oladipo has adjusted. Is Harris just that much worse as a 3 than he is as a stretch 4?
James Gagner::I didnt think they would make the playoffs but i thopught they would win like 30 guess not.
Emmanuel Foret::Magic fan here... ready to watch another game were we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. TANK.
Michael Glankler::The vicious circle of being an NBA fan, teams are a rising and a falling all the time.  I should know I'm a Bobcats fan.
James Gagner::Here is the part where the Magic give it away.
Tim Darnell::J they gonna be alright. They may still squeeze a playoff run
James Gagner::They gonna make a run at the number one pick.
Tim Darnell::They gonna make it out..
Michael O Keefe::Jabari Parker/Marcus Smart here we come.
Dean Helming::wow orlando looks bad.
Dean Helming::and then zeller comes in and suddenly orlando finds their confidence
