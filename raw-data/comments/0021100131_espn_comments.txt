KeepHatingOnMelo::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  1) Melo is in good hands in New York, enjoy your chicken nuggets.  2) NY hustled DENVER for their superstar.  3) Half the chicken nuggets sent to Denver, aren't even playing for Denver this season.  Knicks win.
KeepHatingOnMelo::HAHAHAHA
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::WHY DIDNT MELO PLAY?
paul2285::Pathetic display Nugz......I don't think Karl knows how to use the bench yet, why did Koufos only play 10 minutes after he tore up the Hornets last game?
The Big Stroonzo::Knicks: 5-4, on the way up Creamy Nooggets: 6-4, on the way down  oops!!
KeepHatingOnMelo::Any win gets us into the playoffs, so I guess it is a big win.
Pusherman3::Congrats on beating the Bobcats.  Big night for you.
Pusherman3::Low energy game by Denver...moving on.
eightbitme::Hornets are my dark horse this year.  They will make the playoffs, and hopefully eliminate the Clippers.  :-)
nba is the worst::So much for "undefeated at home"...  Nice win for the Hornets - Landry and Kaman ruling the paint
klesk80::You odd makers better not  smoke no pot next time~!^^ -13 Denver -11Knicks.....LOL  "Never Under estimate the New Orleans Hornets~!"
wasted_101::WHY DID DENVER TRADE FELTON FOR ANDRE MILLER. DENVER COULD OF GOTTEN WAY BETTER VALUE.
Pusherman3::They got Miller, who has been playing very well, J. Hamilton with the pick...and later Rudy and Brewer for nothing, as Dallas threw away what they got in the original three way deal.  It was a very good deal for Denver.  Felton is overrated...look at his percentages this year.
magic1jordan2::Hey Stern, glad you made the trade that served the better interest of the Hornets.  Because otherwise who knows how bad your record would be.  Oh wait, they're pretty $@%!$@ bad.....nevermind then
CBass1317::The only way small market teams can improve is with young players and draft picks ... but it takes time.  Taking on big contracts of veteran players close to 30 years old (see Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, etc.), just so the team can lose in the first round, is the real insult to fans.
magic1jordan2::I wish the Hornets all the best but I think I have more of a vested interest in them than the "stand in" impromptu owner does.  Mr. Stern's furthest concern is the New Orleans
taste_teh_reinbo::This hornets team w/o CP3 is probably better than w/ him. Also the hornets have had a lot of injuries to key players and have had probably the biggest roster turnover out of any team in the league. Oh well as a hornets fan i'm hoping they're competitive while being bad so that way they can land a potential stud in the draft.
DenverDiehard35::ESPN chat BLOWS. Almost as hard as the Jazz
bmosheman::I am really PO'd that the team is not going undefeated this year.  Time to follow the Rockies.  Good luck in the post-season, New Orleans fans.
phatty3327::does melo watch nuggets games
sty34::what do you think
DenverDiehard35::On friday we were number 1 in the west. Now, we're number 7
sty34::yep that's how things start when your only a few games into the season daawwwg
sty34::wut
DenverDiehard35::ive always been one to live in the moment
PHXNation::Nene,  5 years 65 Million = 12.5 ppg 7.3 rpb Afflalo 5 years 38 Million = 11 ppg , nothing else worth mentioning  Incredible, like stealing candy from a baby.
bmosheman::agree.  all teams with good players should go 66-0 this year or they've wasted money.
DenverDiehard35::told u they aint worth nothing. we overpaid for both of them, none of them are irreplaceable
sty34::afflalo is straight garbage this year
sty34::wtf just happened
DenverDiehard35::NO's defense was ridiculous. We had nowhere to go and looked like we had no offense
bmosheman::First really bad loss of the season.  The loss at POR doesn't seem as bad with the way that team has been playing.  Other two losses were at SAN by 4 and at LAL by 3.  Embarassing to lose to Hornets, but these happen over the course of a season.
taste_teh_reinbo::NO isn't that bad of team. they've just had injuries pile up early in the season on top of having so many new players being worked into the system. Although I do think the Nugs are the better team at this point.
wasted_101::DENVER TRADED MELO FOR A BUNCH OF AVERAGE PLAYERS
KeepHatingOnMelo::You people are dumb. Melo is a TYPE-A scorer in the league. He can create, literally, any shot he wants. NY won the deal. BTW, Denver will never make it out of the West without a TYPE-A player.
Pusherman3::Gallo &gt; Melo
DenverDiehard35::i didnt see u people sayin that when we got put number 3 in power rankings
KeMvP277::Denver and portland are two super dangerous teams in the west, and neither has a superstar. You don't need a superstar to be a good team.
Slurm Soda::That was better than getting nothing idiot.
wasted_101::denver who
bmosheman::Youch.  Good day, NO.  Nugs, get that clunker out of our system.
RonJeremysStache::at least your record is better than Minnesota's
Slurm Soda::You like a lot of teams.
Slurm Soda::The BCS is a joke.
DenverDiehard35::Take nothing away from NO: They may not be the best or most talented team but they outplayed the sh** out of us this game. They shot incredibly, played ridiculous defense and crashed the boards like they were behind the whole game. NO played a hell of a game and if i was a NO fan i would be super proud of my team for bouncing back from a 6 game losing streak, coming into Denver and wiping our own floor with the nuggets players. I have no problem putting credit where credit is due. But when we got Phx, Utah and Portland fans on here, thats the only thing that gets ridiculous. if u wanna talk about the game, cool. but saying stupid things is just over the top.
DenverDiehard35::No, Im talking bout the schedule, or "key victories" as u said. LA played a back to back just like we did so we were just as tired, Dallas started slow but lost on a buzzerbeater to lose, and it was in dallas. we were given the schedule we were given, any win in the nba is good
PHXNation::Okay, we both agree CP3 will be unanimous PG starter for West right? with Westbrook guaranteed reserve.  Leaves one slot open  Lawson 16.6 ppg 6.6 apg in 33 minutes Nash 12 ppg 9.8 apg in 28 minutes Parker 13.4 ppg 7.1 apg in 29 minutes  Lowry 15.0 ppg 10.0 apg 6.0 rpg in 32 minutes   I picked teams that will most likely be above 500. by all star break, Ellis will not get in again this year. Still look over the top to you? Parker or Lowry have to be considered ahead of Ty.
DenverDiehard35::number 2!
PHXNation::What exactly did I say that was over the top?  That Denver has no All-Stars?  Only key victory was against a road weary Lakers? Preseason games don't matter?  Yes, way over the top.
KeMvP277::Phoenix has no right to talk s.hit about this loss b/c nola beat them on opening day on their floor.
cmrn631::Wow seriously Nuggets pathetic.

KeMvP277::Hornets played out of their minds tonight. Denver is still a top 5 team in the west and playoff bound. This coming from a hornets fan.
KeMvP277::This is why you don''t say a team has a 92% chance of winning a game ESPN. You did nothing but jinx Denver. GO NOLA.
TacoTracker::/b ok
Slurm Soda::/b/
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::Nuggets need to draft John Hensen
KeMvP277::NORTH CAROLINA=BEST TEAM IN CB
brieman272::the hornets won?!?!?
Marlins35DTrain::I remember my first time.
Coltonbball12::Now is a great time for the Nuggets to deal Mozgov.  This starting him thing has gone on long enough.  Trade him for somebody that can at least score inside and is a big guy.  Mozgov just takes up space and misses shots which makes us lose possessions.  Trade him for somebody that can get the job done on the starting line.  Mozgov can get a few decent players that can grow in the Nuggets system but I am sick of Mozgov getting the ball and me KNOWING he will miss the shot and then just jog back up the court.  It is frustrating.
Coltonbball12::Amen... amen.  Koufos is good but in the role he is in.  We need a center that can fit the starting role and Mozgov in there is a joke.
PHXNation::Could be worse, you could have Robin Lopez -_-
Slurm Soda::The only person that could be the Center of th future on the roster right now is Koufos. And I doubt that. Either get a good Center or draft one and actually play him.
Slurm Soda::I posted this comment at 9:41 PM
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::new orleans is actually the lost city of atlantis
Joeschmo loves Heat::Your jokes are actually not funny.
wegood736::LOL
127decibels::...but he cracks himself up.
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::I remember the Nuggets played the Hornets in the playoffs and beat them by 63 haha
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::63 points wow
127decibels::January 9th, wow!
peachy1124::i remember when the hornets traded cp3 and are going no where...
127decibels::Kinda like when Melo dumped the nuggies?
CompletelyIrrevelant::And Nuggs got swept by thunder, last year doesn't matter bro, what happens now matters.
Marlins35DTrain::No they didn't.
KeMvP277::I remember when the hornets beat the nuggets on january 9th 2012
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::not by 63
PHXNation::LOL
Slurm Soda::I remember when it was Christmas
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::ROLLL TIDDE
YouBLEWWIt::It would be funny if AP Poll voted LSU as co-champions. HAHahahah
DenverDiehard35::I was pissed after we lost to SA in a heart breaker, was pissed all weekend waiting for this game... and now this
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::Ty Lawson is gonna go to the All -Star game fosho
127decibels::Pretty sure your boyfriend liked it.
127decibels::I'll just let that ridiculous statement fall on it's own.  Are you two?
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::are ya dumb
PHXNation::over Westbrook, Paul, Ellis, Nash.... are you sure?
PHXNation::Ellis been playing PG this year. Lawson will get an All Star nod over Nash? not even if Nash was 50. 17 Assists from Mr. Nashty last night in 3 quarters. Lawson is nothing more than a Andre Miller in his prime..... Whom which never had an all star appearance either.
YouBLEWWIt::Over Nash for sure, PHO is bad. Ellis is considered a SG.
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::you like your comment nice!
127decibels::That, and the Nuggies won't lose at home all year.
PHXNation::Only good win out of the Nuggets 6 games was against a road weary Laker team.(Dallas is not the same team as last year). other than that we got Jazz, Milwaukee, Sacramento, New Orleans wins.
PHXNation::Honestly, how did it feel to see Danny Green go off on your team for 24... haha DANNY GREEN for fuckks sake!
PHXNation::Nope, to be honest I have Gallo on my fantasy team so I just randomly strolled in since there aren't many games playing today. I don't follow Denver basketball, but what I do know is that the Denver Nuggets aren't 8-4 they're 6-4. I don't about bball, okay. What I do know is that your team locked in long term contracts with two players that will never make an All Star game. Good luck figuring which player in Nene or Afflalo to use the amnesty option next year.
DenverDiehard35::Hi PHXNation: Only losing teams forget preseason games in a short season with virtually no preseason. and yes i will be ready for when we play ur team in the regular season. I didnt see u on these boards when we won games in dallas, against LA or when we played SA tight in SA and in LA. So the fact youre here tells me u dont know much about bball and just looked at the scoreboard. and slobbered was a good word.
PHXNation::They definitely need to get Wilson back then. Clips should get JR and dump Foye
PHXNation::Does Denver have enough to retain Martin, JR and WIlson when they are cleared? That team last year was scary, i'll admit.
YouBLEWWIt::No, they're FAs, except for Wilson Chandler. And DEN doesn't want them, except for Wilson Chandler.
DenverDiehard35::can i ask why u come onto a denver NO board to act like a big boy? Nuggs slobbered all over ur team and would do it again so i wouldnt act like ur team is elite
PHXNation::Hi DenverDiehard, i know you're upset but things will be okay... Oh and slobbered? not quite the best choice of words when talking about basketball, but okay. BTW nobody remembers preseason games. I'll be looking forward to the FIRST matchup of the SEASON between the Denver Nuggets and Phoenix Suns.
Joeschmo loves Heat::I'm going to suppose that comment wasn't for me. If it was for PHX then I agree.
Joeschmo loves Heat::Denver is a decent team. They still have some gaps left to fill before they can contend against the Thunder or even the Lakers for that matter but it's looking much better this year. The franchise in general has been looking great after the infusion of young talent from that clown that now plays in NY.
RonJeremysStache::Why aren't you sensible Nugs fans calling out the racists in your fanbase?
BigRedFire617::Don't encourage him, Just ignore the racist D-bag and he will go away. Not a Nugget btw.
Slurm Soda::Who is a racist? lol
YouBLEWWIt::CP3, Westbrook  Third West All-Star PG will be up between Lawson and Lowry.
PHXNation::You must take a good winning record into perspective, or else guys like Gordon, Martin, Ellis would've made the All Star Reserve last couple of years.. Tony Parker will be a shoe-in if Spurs are second, not right but thats they way the coaches vote.
CompletelyIrrevelant::Ur trippin if u think that Westbrook will make All-Star team this year
CompletelyIrrevelant::I have no doubts bout Harden and Durant making the All-Star, but no way Russ makes it. Saying this as a Thunder fan.
Slurm Soda::He might make it just because he is Westbrook
CompletelyIrrevelant::Westbrook leads the league in TOs, and has a career-low Assists and low FG%. No way man, no way.
YouBLEWWIt::I'm trippin? Like I was last year? He's already made his name in the league, he will get the benefit of the doubt. He's going to have to regress (numbers wise) pretty dramatically for that to happen.  But if OKC will continue to have the best record in the West, don't be surprised if Harden makes it as well.
PortlandBlazers1004::Lowry!
Slurm Soda::Is Lowry doing good
PW-52::Yea he is having a really good year.
PW-52::Rubio!!!
YouBLEWWIt::I like Rubio, but he's going to need to start, and then help carry that team at least get close to .500.
PortlandBlazers1004::Rudy shot 50%....??????????? That's absurd. Probably the best game he'll have. Good luck with him Nuggets :)
Slurm Soda::He is a streaky shooter
BigRedFire617::Not really. No one calls Ray Allen, who is definitely a shooter, Streaky.
YouBLEWWIt::He is a shooter...by basketball definition, streaky is a given.
DenverDiehard35::My opinion:  Lawson: Did his thing, got hurt, came back. He's a warrior he cant do it all. Good game Gallo: Played well, shot alright, didnt attack the hoop near as much as he should have Afflalo: Sucks. Cant shoot, cant dribble, what can he do? Waste of our money Nene: Soft. Had one sweet dunk, besides that, invisible. Mozzy:Enough is enough, he needs to not play Dre: Horrible game. Hes solid, he'll bounce back. his shot selection kills me sometimes tho Rudy: Hate the guy. He shoots the same % from 3 as Nene would if Nene tried 3s. He needs to shoot better Bird: He needs to never play. How many times will he go for the first pump fake before he never plays again.  Al: Invisible out there, not what were used to from him this year. He'll bounce back Kouf: Needs more pt, i dont understand what is up GK's as* Faried: Needs to play. I am getting pissed cuz GK is trying to show he is a tough guy and Faried is instant energy. Our big men should sit and he should get some PT till Nene and Mozzy decide to play.  Brewer: Did alright, needs to stay in his zone and not do too much
dutchjugs perth::your entitled to your opinion.. just think he is so not interested ou their!! i think he is past it!!
Marlins35DTrain::Felton wanted out. They got much more in Miller than they should have for a disgruntled player.
dutchjugs perth::dre will not bounce back... he is finished.. worst trade idea ever giving up felton for that piece of garbage
DenverDiehard35::hes solid, not a starter anymore but good backup
CompletelyIrrevelant::These 'experts' really thought that Nuggets are top 3 team in the NBA? Wow
Slurm Soda::It was one game...
CompletelyIrrevelant::Nuggs are 6-4 right now. Definately not a top 3 team in the NBA.
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::1 game and you make it sound like we do this all the time
supreme91::what indian kid is everyone talking about????
LxAxWxSxOxN x3z::that indian kid needs to get those new jordans to me
Slurm Soda::Ones that were thrown in a dumpster in the 90s then someone from the Red Cross found them and donated them to him. Sorry...
mdj1988::they showing the 09-10 season in india...11-12 will have to wait sometime
mdj1988::do they have colour tv yet?
JazzFanFromINDIA::haha !!! Ignorant Idiot !
jpark1414::blazers will rock either team :)
dutchjugs perth::how bad is andre miller??  AWFUL!!!
ShaneP504::chucking up 3's knowing its not his range lol
dutchjugs perth::i wouldn't have traded felton for that piece off garbage!!  embarrising out their!!
ShaneP504::Good games Nuggets but the Hornets defense was just nasty this game
dutchjugs perth::REALLY  good game? wow you got no idea!!!
dutchjugs perth::i like!!  fair call
ShaneP504::just showing online sportsmanship bro
