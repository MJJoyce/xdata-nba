Overrated415::Curry looked like he was heading for a monster game before the injury
rayfinkle29::steve nash is a stupid canuck
AZwildcatz4life::MVP
redbob4444::rayfinkle is a jealous troll
rayfinkle29::why would i be jealous of the suns i'm a knicks fan. lin all the way baby
HiddenCounter::Am I the only one who really liked what I saw from McGuire?
toogodly::hey pheonix fans, how many championships do you guys have total? 1, yay 2001 d-backs! now let's take a looksie at the bay area...oh um 13...
HiddenCounter::You haven't been to our beaches then.
AZwildcatz4life::arizona has hotter women than bay area. truth
adamgrimes9::Im a dubs fan and....^ Hes right
SB-47-10::WARRIOR NBA TITLES???!! HOW MANY.. ????
Forkitout24::one word for you: fuckshit
jamarockheatfan::Damn curry is one of my favorite players I wish he could stay healthy.
iloveeverythingespnloves::weres michael bradley at?
dc100::Anyone have any thoughts on Ekpe Udoh's game today? He shot the ball only once in 22 minutes. The recap said he had a left knee contusion. I really want to see this kid do well.
dreballs::ya he struggled bigtime tonight. Either it was the knee, lack of focus because he didnt start, or Marcin Gortat is just too freakin big
tobrv65::He had very little mobility. Still sore from the other night.
lucas_ya::kwame brown and contributing shouldn't be in the same sentence
DoubleV1369::i was thinking the exact same thing when he was signed, but after how HORRIBLE Beidrins has been, and how solid he was as a defender and rebounder, i cant complain about how he was playing before his injury.
JeffKent4MVP::kwame brown was actually contributing, would have liked to see him still playing. He is the only one who can clog the lane on this team
tobrv65::I seriously want to light a firecracker under Klay Thompson. He walks around the court like he is a 15 year vet. Rookie needs to move. Your not that cool Klay. Great shooter, but walks around like a snail!
tobrv65::Watch him when he misses a shot, the ball goes the other way and he will stand there as the other team breaks for a layup. He did it tonight and did not get back in the game.
supe540::Huh?
testname5::Even though our rebounding sucked, Nate wasn't hitting anything until it counted, and we blew a 21 point lead... we still managed to get through. WAY TO GO MONTA! (just next time please take better shots before making the game-winner yet again)
dreamhax::they did have 2 injuries. curry didn't even play the whole 2nd half.
dreamhax::same.
testname5::yeah, but a win is a win... I'll take it!
zinkerled::Kobe is averaging five 3pt shots per game and making 28% of them.  That is unbelievably bad.
PHXNation::Warriors brass says they will make a move before deadline, that means bye bye Monta. Dubs need a big man.
dreamhax::lol how are mad are you? PHX is terrible.
testname5::monta is there biggest weapon though, I can't imagine them giving him away
JeffKent4MVP::no phxnation
testname5::me?
JeffKent4MVP::its a troll
supe540::Yeah, Biedrins has been a true disaster.  I like Gortat though.
BFH1992::Anyone know what happened to Steph Curry??
AZwildcatz4life::he broke his dignity
PHXNation::kid has talent to be great, it's too bad his body isn't able to endure the wear and tear each season.
HoosWarriors::tendon strain in foot, back soon, not his ankle
PHXNation::Suns and Warriors both suck. Suns have cap room this summer to get better, while Warriors are locked in for 46 mill... ouch  guess no hope for this team.
gsraider::Warriors will have the same money they were able to offer deandre Jordan when kwame comes off the books so we can still add a good piece around 10 million
PHXNation::Not really, the more suns lose the better chances to rebuild.
HoosWarriors::sore loser
jmcneal333::Good game Suns! I am just glad my Warriors found a way to pull this one out. Way to go Warriors!
JeffKent4MVP::warriors need alot of work, wish tyson chandler signed with the dubs
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::One last thing to say before I leave the site. Sports junkies rule and news hounds suck.
naes666::don't forget the gamblers and trolls...
lightbulbthinh::good time to be a bay area fan
AZwildcatz4life::cool story. GS still blows and the suns own them overall
FriscoWarriors415::Monta needs to stop taking bad shots!! Its killing us
AZwildcatz4life::ballhog
HoosWarriors::Yeah his turnaround game winning jumper killed us
FriscoWarriors415::Nate doesnt shoot as much though. And he makes alot of his shots! He will have a off night every now and then like every player in the NBA
JeffKent4MVP::we need an inside prescense and interior defense like an obese person needs a diet
supe540::What about Nate?  Every shot was a bad shot.
GsDubb12::Suns have a 43 year old former MVP point guard, 48 yr old grant hill,, Channing frye, and a bunch of role players. Nothing to be excited about.
Gambling and Rambling::gatta give Suns credit for fighting back in this game unlike Hawks
acw55::why did steph curry only play 9 or 10 minutes???
naes666::injured again
supe540::See below
nickb12877::whyd curry only play 10 mins
HoosWarriors::Its fine hell be back after all star break, not his ankle
naes666::why? the boy is made of glass...
nickb12877::just traded for him in my fantasy league
acw55::ah damn it!
lightbulbthinh::injured as usual+
FriscoWarriors415::Hurt his foot. He is fine though
supe540::Hurt his foot.
acw55::ikr???

JeffKent4MVP::monta takes over the ball game
PHXNation::13 game losing streak in PHX? aha dubs wished they had some kind of homestand streak against ANY team in the league.
naes666::you ripped your name off from Raider Nation...that pretty much speaks for itself. bottom of the barrel in the desert bro
PHXNation::How does it feel to settle for Kwame when Tyson, DeAndre, and Dwight want no part of the bay area. must hurt.
naes666::hows that Barkley and Majerle coming out of retirement working for you?
PHXNation::Both teams suck, both teams will be in the lottery. But at least PHX will have a lot more cap room... Kwame for what 7 mill? how did that go, and how is David lee's contract treatin y'all..
JeffKent4MVP::a bad team talking crap on a another bad team? you need help
jmcneal333::It does not matter, they just beat the Suns in their house! EAT IT!
GsDubb12::Why are you mad? And talking $.H.1.T? Both these teams aren't making the playoffs.
supe540::So do the Suns.
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::GG
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::OUCH! What a tragedy. I won't sleep well tonight. Then again I never sleep well on nights when the Suns lose. :(

wiccan_cowboy::more like 49ers giants warriors sharks..  the A's and Raiders BLOW
PHXNation::i take it you go for raiders, a's and warriors.. i feel your pain of enduring countless losing seasons.
Aaron.Rob::Still bitter?
