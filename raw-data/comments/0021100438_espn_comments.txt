eliassteve::Whats funny is that Dallas does not even have one person other than Dirk even participating in the all star. Not 3-pt contest, no slamdunk, no skills. From the defending champs, no one other than Dirk and Dirk had to get charity votes to get into the all star game.     Where are all the people who said Chandler, JJB, JET, Kidd,Marion is an allstar, thats why they won the championship last year. What a joke. Dirk was the only superstar who let his team by himself to a championship. Not Kobe, Not Shaq, Not wade, Not Pierce. This tells you how special Dirk is.

ballerjust4u253::who wants to trade tony parker and derick rose
dcpro::love the defensive intensity from carlisle.  hell of a coach
World Champs t y Dirk::This team is really starting to take form and they are way under the radar with no respect.  Just like I like it.  Great job by R. Carlisle in my opinion.
Ali-champ::Great to see Lamar Odom settling in w/ the Mavs. I think it is escaping the highlight and press coverage because of the "LINsanity" thing plus because Odom's game never was attention grabber. His good nights with the Lakers were like this past game and I dare say this past stretch, 12-16 points, great D, and a few rebounds (w/ a couple of assists, steals, or blocks here and there). I am happy w/ this sort of stat line for the rest of the season.
diehardnr1::DEN vs DAL 35.7% vs 46.3% FGM  22.2% vs 38.5% 3ptM 58.1% vs 81.8% FTM  Do not need to look further than that to explain  this game... Congrats on the tie breaker Hopefully, if Nuggz Mavs meet again it will be with a full squad like first DAL game and not one when missing their starting front court.  I said they needed a fast start and for someone to step up to have any shot in this one...they got neither  Other than that...just one of those flat games with a couple of question marks about Karl.  Thought it was a huge mistake to bench Faried to start 3rd...He has been getting the starts because GK wants  his second squad to gel as a unit for when starters are back...so why mess that up and kill Farieds confidence to boot?  and as usual the gambit failed miserably...turning a manageable deficit into a rout (aided by the above numbers of course).  (Did WChandler HAVE to score 41 and get 18RB in the win that put his team into the playoffs?? Would be nice with his shot and D back)  GO NUGGETS!!!
Mavsolute_Beast_41::the first game Mavs weren't a basketball team at all
Mavsolute_Beast_41::JR,KM were free agents, why are u bringing names that have nothing to do with the Nuggs? Your team core was there and ready to go.We had to figure out 5-6 new players in our rotation and veteran guys need more time to come in playing shape.That team simply wasn't the Mavs.
diehardnr1::like the Nuggz were?? They lost 3 players to China (well 1 since JR/KM were leaving),  did not know who their starters were until almost game time due to late signings.  They just out hustled the Mavs in first game and got out hustled this game...injuries no excuse for lack of hustle I saw displayed at times by Nuggets
Mavsolute_Beast_41::DA MABS!
R Bond::Cuban also gave $25K for local school scholarships.
theschubert::Still confused as to why Timberwolves fans are trolling Mavs game threads................

HAHAHAHA JOIN THE WOLVES NATION BEFORE ITS TO LATE!!!!!!!!  The Timberwolves debuted on November 3, 1989, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics on the road 106–94. Five days later, they would make their home debut at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome losing to the Chicago Bulls 96–84. Just two nights later the Wolves would get their first win, beating the Philadelphia 76ers at home 125–118 on November 10. The Timberwolves, led by Tony Campbell with 23.2 ppg, went on to a 22–60 record, finishing in 6th place in the Midwest Division. Playing in the cavernous Metrodome, the expansion Timberwolves drew over 1 million fans[3] (an NBA record for attendance) including the third-largest crowd in NBA history at 49,551 on April 17, 1990, which saw the Timberwolves lose to the Denver Nuggets 99–88 in the final home game of the season. The next season the team moved into their permanent home, the Target Center, and improved somewhat, finishing 29–53. However, they fired their head coach Bill Musselman. They fared far worse in the 1991–92 NBA season under Musselman's successor, ex-Celtics coach Jimmy Rodgers, finishing with an NBA-worst 15–67 record. Looking to turn the corner, the Wolves hired former Detroit Pistons general manager Jack McCloskey to the same position, but even with notable first-round selections such as Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider, the Timberwolves were unable to duplicate McCloskey's "Detroit Bad Boys" success in the Twin Cities, finishing 19–63 and 20–62 the next two seasons. One of the few highlights from this era was when the Target Center served as host of the 1994 All-Star Game where Rider won the Slam Dunk Contest with his between-the-leg "East Bay Funk Dunk". As winning basketball continued to elude the Wolves, Ratner and Wolfenson nearly sold the team to New Orleans interests in 1994 before NBA owners rejected the proposed move. Eventually, Glen Taylor bought the team and named Kevin McHale general manager. The Wolves finished 21–61 in 1994–95, and the future looked bleak. However, a change was on the horizon./////./.</b>

Like most expansion teams, the Timberwolves struggled in their early years; but after the acquisition of Kevin Garnett in the 1995 NBA Draft, the team made the playoffs eight consecutive times from 1997 to 2004.
