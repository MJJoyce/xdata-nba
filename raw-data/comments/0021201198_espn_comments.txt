StenS10::I guess you can now call him the ANKLEMAMAL :-)
My sources tell me that::Javale McGee will now step it up.
Greygoose crew::Nuggets are done
CUBUFFSPAC10::whatever, still the deepest team in the league with the most athletic center coming off the bench, who will fill in perfectly.
NDman13::keep telling yourself that.
Pusherman3::I fully expect Faried to play.   He is a tough dude.
nolanroth::If Faried played for the Lakers and he was the 4th player off the bench every game this would be the headline on espn.com.  I think Lawson and Faried need to sit as long as possible and stay healthy
bearsbball12::Lawson is healthy...
gw687::Faried might want to sit out the whole first round just to get his ankle back.  Faried not being 100% is like playing at 50%, most of his positives come from athleticism.  Just ticked to see him go down, he plays so hard.  That said, to all the Portland fans, if Lilliard isn't the rookie of the year I think your city should file a lawsuit against the NBA.  That would be a joke.  I know a lot of ESPN writers are pushing Anthony Davis right now, they are idiots who haven't been paying attention.
puhleezho::nuggets would still win first round against golden state or houston without faried.  hopefully he can get back to 100% by second round!
cscobra::Houston is the perfect match up for Denver, first round sweep
inityminiwur::For every Nuggets player that goes out with an injury, there's always another Nuggets player who steps up. I mean, where did Evan Fournier come from? Anthony Randolph has stepped up and blended in quite nicely. And who can forget, the Shaqtin-a-Fool Hall-of-Famer, Javale McGee!!!!
ConvicedSince06_JamesGang::***PSA***THIS BOARD IS NOW WHITE HOT.....AND THE HEAT IS ON.....BE VERY AFFRAID....THE PLAYOFFS ARE ALMOST HERE!!!
ConvicedSince06_JamesGang::***PSA***THIS BOARD IS NOW WHITE HOT.....AND THE HEAT IS ON.....BE VERY AFFRAID....THE PLAYOFFS ARE ALMOST HERE!!!
sysbaker1::That sucks! The Nuggets and George Karl have done great things this year and it is too bad the injury bug hit them. Speedy recovery to the Manimal!
heytherehater::ps vita &gt; xbox 360
heytherehater::this sucks man im starting to feel sorry for the nuggets...
Young_Guruu::This, countless other injuries, and mediocre basketball are just a few reasons the NBA should shorten the season. They'll never do it because of the money they'd lose but it's just pointless.
airicad::I just realized that Iguodala was one assist away from leading the Nuggets in ALL 5 major statistical categories (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks).  A poor man's Lebron indeed... but he is as good as Lebron on a good shooting night!
johnselway::I knew Kenneth was going to get hurt.....He looked pretty stiff after the San Antonio game......FU.CK!!!!
RoidRage1986::I can't stand Andre Miller anymore. The dude plays ZERO defense and slows the offense to a crawl after they were running the Blazers out of the gym. He has also missed some clutch FT's of late and still plays Melo ball when he isn't getting calls. Dude needs to pack his bags.
cscobra::Miller might be wearing down with all the minutes he had to play with Lawson out.  He should sit out last two and come back refreshed for playoffs.  Perfect time to see what rookie can do when given meaningful and impactful minutes
jayeteee::We're toast if we go into the playoffs without Miller. I think Fournier needs to get some minutes, but as bad as Miller's played the last couple games, he still gives us an advantage going into the playoffs.
RickyWolfioMIA_MINNY::Crazy how iggys stat line is a typical BRON stat line
Jeff Van Gundy the_one::denver nuggets are one of the team to watch
Jordanbetonbasketball1990-1998::Javale McGee!!!!!!!!
Kobelies247::Pa needs to sell this team...
apodpora12::What the hell? There's some insider story on the ESPN NBA front page that says Anthony Davis should be the ROY.. I nearly spit my drink in my lap
olsonmt47::How can you not cheer for this Nuggets team?
Greygoose crew::Ez
Jumeax::Love one of the highlhgts, Lawson runnig the ball up in Transition,  Lets McGee (Truck) run past and instead Passes to  Randolph (Talier) pick you poison  Its just ridiculous having both a 7 footer and 6'10" running the beak
bearsbball12::Good job Nuggs. Magic number for HC down to 1, magic number for the 3 seed down to 2. Tomorrow could be tough without the Manimal, I hope we can take care of business.
Kegg73::Too bad they might not have any bodies left if the injury bug keeps biting.
bearsbball12::Chandler back into the starting lineup I'd guess.
jalfmar29::Even though it'd probably help us (Rockets) if we should end up playing you (Neither we nor GS really want to [I've seen them say so], but you take what you get), I'd hate if Faried was out for a long time. He's fun to watch.
BladesOfChaos09::Andre Miller -18 is ridiculous, this guy is getting to washed up . I am glad GK is giving Fournier minutes instead of going to his "veteran".
jayeteee::The Nuggets would not have won 50 games without Andre Miller. I agree, he's hit a rough patch, but he's hit a lot of smooth patches throughout the season too. Great facilitator and probably our best post up player. We need Miller. And yes, Fournier's earned more PT.
BKbouncer14::Really? The player with the second most assists in the fourth quarter behind only Lebron James is washed up? Please provide actual evidence, beyond just stating your opinion.
oguhmas::well he did say plus/minus. And Miller is a -31 over the last 3 games. Totally lost the Dallas game too.
I prefer boxers over briefs::Fournier is definitely a GREAT find.  Masai strikes again....
genius0182::The Nuggets are falling apart at the wrong time.
akan44::I think you are trippin homes cuz they are doing pretty good
Dan_Phelps::he meant injuries equaled falling apart not their wins and losses
Slambo12345::"FGCU-Fan_Since_2013NCAA_Tournament - Still dominated top Western teams this year so whats the next excuse?"  The Rockets beat your teams @$$ like Garnett did to Melo's girl. East is weak
I prefer boxers over briefs::Can't wait till MElo is one and done in the playoffs.  Again.
FGCU-Fan_Since_2013NCAA_Tournament::Knicks 50+ Wins with a "Black hole" and Old guys &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nuggets 50+ wins with a group of athletic young bucks.  What happened Nuggets fans, I thought KNicks would never reach 50 win season with Melo?
washheightsboy3::Knicks fans should worry about the pacers and heat before thinking about the nuggets. You will play one, maybe two east teams in the playoffs. You will face zero teams from the west.
rockymountainhigh85::hahah knicks fans...
ESPNisBSN3WS::nuggets=37-14 vs the West Knicks=17-13 vs the west  just stop
barteltd::When the Nuggets had Melo I always said we could be a 2 or 3 seed in the east and basically the 2013 Nix are just 2005 Nuggets East.
LeftBaseline::Nuggets hold a winning records versus Eastern teams.
rwilliams75::Knicks are a 6 seed in the West
NDman13::What's their record against playoff western teams?
rwilliams75::And they would be a 6 seed, kind of ironic really.
FGCU-Fan_Since_2013NCAA_Tournament::yea and hold a Winning record against Western teams
LeftBaseline::The Knicks play in the Eastern Conference. Thats whats up.
LeftBaseline::FGCU-Fan_Since_2013NCAA_Tournament - Still dominated top Western teams this year so whats the next excuse?  Nuggets Dominated your Knicks.
FGCU-Fan_Since_2013NCAA_Tournament::Still dominated top Western teams this year so whats the next excuse?
Jumeax::"If I can walk, I can play"  that typer of heo ball matrydom crap might work for Kobe,  but if you can only barely walk, chances are somone else might be able to play better than you  Get well soon Faired, just dont rush back,
washheightsboy3::Kobe was averaging a career high for minutes per game this year. That's nuts.
Jumeax::Randolph has had two good games with 20 minutes,  The big question is has he fianlly got his $@%! together in a way he can contirbute consistently  if so....  Look out
Nuggsfan35::Does anyone know what happened to Quincy miller? Is he in the d league still?
I prefer boxers over briefs::He's had some garbage time minutes in a couple of games lately.
rolandftw::He's incredibly, incredibly raw.  Helped Faried off the floor with his ankle injury today, so still on the active roster
Jumeax::Ujiri is just saving him as secret weapon for playoffs :P
Nuggsfan35::Nooooo. Hope the manimal comes back healthy.
washheightsboy3::Ok. Division winner is the first tiebreaker. Then head to head. Overall record is used for home court, then head to head once the seeding is set. This will cause odd things to happen like when Denver got the 3 with only 44 wins but had to play at the #6 (2006 v clips and lost in 5)
barteltd::One more win to clinch home court in the first round.  Go Nuggets!
washheightsboy3::One more for home court. Two more for the 3
jayeteee::Are you sure? LOL Seems like there is no one answer to this puzzling question.
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::Anyway good game today. We can't afford letdown tomorrow. About to watch Kobe-less Lakers. See yall tomorrow..!
dwighthowardsamazing::Wasnt Portland 26-26 at some point in the season?
jahlove1261::Denver fans - I see the Frenchy is starting to contribute - is he legit???
Manimal__35::too legit, too legit to quit
69durango::Teamwork......Manimal injured early,  Chandler and Brewer have off game.....Fournier and Randolph pick it up....Iggy and Lawson played great.....KK and McGee gave a good effort..... One more win and we're #3.
downy2by4::We don't own tiebreaker on clipps idiot. Look it up
den24cb::We have the tiebreak against the Clippers. All we need is one more win.
PACASANO::All we hold on Clips is a  3-1 record against them.
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::Nope. We don't own the tiebreak vs Clippers. So if they win out, we have to win out..!!
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::You are wrong. Read down where they say if Clippers,Nuggets,Grizz are all tied.  3. Clippers. 4. Nuggets  5. Grizz..!!
JustineS04::For seeding, a division winner can't finish lower than 4. But for HCA, head-to-head is the first tiebreaker. I thought. I could be wrong though.
JustineS04::Denver Stiffs disagrees. http://www.denverstiffs.com/2013/3/20/4127830/clearing-up-the-thunder-grizzlies-clippers-nuggets-western-conference
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::No because we would have the same record and they own the first tiebreak which is division winner and they are division winners while we aren't. We would face Memphis while having HCA..!!
JustineS04::Wouldn't we have home court against them, even if they were the higher seed though? I believe the series is 3-1, no?
wapeee::rox now 6th!  nuggets w/o the manimal this time.  hmm
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::---------------------------------&gt;&gt;&gt;
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::Rockets it is for now..!!
JustineS04::I was worried about whether Chandler and Brewer would be able to step up with Gallo out. Turns out Fournier is basically the French Gallo. ALL HAIL MASAI!
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::Fournier was playing against fellow rookies. Lets see how he does vs Ellis..!!
JustineS04::He's looked really good, especially for a kid no one was really excited about when Denver drafted him. I like his game a lot.
Rick P. Johnson::Dont get ahead of yourself
JustineS04::I'm not expecting him to be able to continue to play this well all the time and he'll make rookie mistakes, but they have similar games. They're both great passers who can create their own shots and cut to the basket. He's solid defensively too and spreads the floor nicely. It's also good to have someone else who can hit FTs.
CUBUFFSPAC10::good to see that Ty the Guy got some game time in, going to be fun during the playoffs.
DNuggs2350::its because all he's been doing is shooting spot up jumpers the last two weeks he's been out. Didn't you hear scott say that. but yeah i can't wait till playoff time!
JustineS04::I can't believe how on his shot is. I didn't expect him to come back so strong.
JustineS04::Anyone else so relieved to see Fournier in over Miller late?
Jumeax::Miller is a great passer,  but definely not a full time point guard, or late game poitn guard Fournier is a much better shooter than miller  and unlike Miller Fournier can jump over miniature chihuahua
Rick P. Johnson::Kind of. Miller too often plays hero ball late, but it does work out sometimes. Really like Fournier though. Kid is really good.
JustineS04::And MIller's slow speed can hurt the offense. Fournier's much faster, and he plays defense.
JustineS04::Where is that idiot who said Iguodala sucks? I believe it was Leon.
Nargash35-Manimal 2.0::LOL he hasn't showed up since Memphis lost yesterday..!!
vinlocsta::They need to start selling Masai Ujiri shirts.
JustineS04::I SO AGREE.
ALEX47666-3::lol rocket  fans think they can beat us but they dont know that faried will be back
nbocheltree::This is all mounting evidence for why the NBA regular season needs to be cut down dramatically. 82 games is just too many for a sport that is this physical.
