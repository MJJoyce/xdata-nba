Bill::How could Bogut get NINE offensive rebounds and not shoot even one free throw?
Don'T Feed Dooley::I love all the holiday food.
Teams stink::The lakers are a chit eating team.  F their injuries, whoever is still playing, obviously SUCKS!
Don'T Feed Dooley::Time to go change my diaper.
Larry'S Brother::Larry, stop being an internet nerd. You always spend your weekends on sport forums. Stop embarrassing our family and get a life! Go somewhere. Do something. Stop sitting on your butt!
Larry'S Brother::Larry, stop trying to be an internet tough guy. Everyone is laughing at your phony act!
DC::Painful to see that #24 on the Injury Report again ... but it is what it is, and life moves on. To win this game, Lakers can't have more than 10-13 turnovers. The Warriors love to run and gun, and any time that ball is loose you can pretty much guarantee the ball is going to be going through the hoop for 3 out of Curry's, Klay's, or Andre's hands. They need to get back on defense especially since the 3 is a big part of the Lakers offense - long shot, long rebound, outlet to Curry, and the Warriors are running again. So we have to keep them in the half court. LA did a great job of this in Minnesota, and it needs to continue tonight. We also need Xavier Henry to play well as he tends to struggle on the road. Lakers will also have to watch the multiple screens set to free up Klay for spot up and launch 3s.
Larry'S Brother::Larry is socially unadaptable in the real world. That's why he lives on the internet.
RODERICK::Warriors need to win this game to shake off losing to the Duncan / Parker / Ginobili -less Spurs. No Kobe for the Lakers. Losing to teams without their best players wont get a team in the NBA Western conference playoffs.
Homey D Clown::@ Larry, You did mean Falling Rock, right? I can't find a SwollenCockonthe map.
