Man From UNC::Is Kyrie Irving ever going to play any defense....whoever he guards causes the Cavs problems.....because Kyrie guards nobody.....so talented on offense at least try to fake playing defense.....
nba is the worst::Irving held Chalmers to 9 pts, 3 ast and 1 reb, while scoring 17 with 4 ast and 4 reb
SNight322::I don't think Kyrie would've done a good job guarding Bosh anyway.

Eternal_Sage::is it active?
Clenbutador::Phil Jackson will coach again.  He most likely will coach whichever team Dwight Howard sign with.
dan torell::Coaching Dwight? Haha... that would be an awkward game for Dwight... Phil requires intellectual player and Dwight is lack of that area.
THE B.E.A.S.T. - PART 9::You know how Phil does it. He loves the easy way out. I got so much more respect for coach Popovich and Riley when he was coaching.
Eternal_Sage::I am the King of the World, yet I have never played a game. I am eternal. I am awesome. I AM PERFECT!  who am I ? (hint, He's the one writing this message)

mintzerkj4eva::Adam Sandler
Eternal_Sage::kobe bryant?
Eternal_Sage::BRIAN SCAL
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Danny Glover?
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::MJ- Went to College to learn the game MORE. enterted the NBA and Won 6rings. changing the game forever  Kobe- Straight outta HS. Learned the Game along the way and Back seat to shaq then leader of a team for 5rings, going strong after 16yrs   Lebron- Straight outta HS....To the Finals..choaked.. Left to join "forces" with another top player in the NBA...choaked again.. 0rings (to be continued)  Stats arent what make a leagacy.. its how u do it.. so far Lebron is not lookin good
THE B.E.A.S.T. - PART 9::Kobe "King of giftwrapped teams" Bryant
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::Well said bro.. notice how no lebron "fans" have commented.cant argue with facts
mintzerkj4eva::Think I found the worst song ever. I would post it but I am not taking responsibility for anyone committing suicide.
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::must be tha rebecca black song friday.. everybody hates that song
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Anything by Niki Manaj or Justin Bieber makes me wanna kill myself
Cadillac_Too_Cold::I hope it's not the Heat's 2010 cover of "We Are the Champions"
Eternal_Sage::POST IT
brandonlee561heat::Anyone see the "rumor" that Phil Jackson is going to return and coach NY?
dan torell::It's just a rumor. Like they said that Phil is going to Miami Heat... :)
Clenbutador::He was retiring to get out of LA because he knew Kobe was done.
nba is the worst::Phil is a Knick - and if his hip problem gets better it could happen
Heatlemaniac....::just like he did with Chicago
-whoa-::this makes no sense kobe is still way better than melo and bynum is way better than stoudemire and so is gasol
mintzerkj4eva::Yeah I have heard this before the season.
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::chris broussard provides us with those rumors all the time. none of them come true though
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::<b>Lebron keeps his body healthy every season I'll give him that.. lol</b>
arcticnorth63::As long as James remains the center of attention, it's all good with him.  It's about Lebron James, not championships.
dan torell::that sounds like carmelo anthony.
mintzerkj4eva::than might have stayed in Cleveland
Clenbutador::6 for 24 in game 7 of the NBA finals. Who am I?
THE B.E.A.S.T. - PART 9::A volume scorer
nba is the worst::FINALS MVP, GAME-HIGH SCORER, 10-PTS IN THE 4TH Q, 5-TIME CHAMP
-whoa-::i never made it to game 7 of the finals i always lose in 4-6  Who am I?
Cadillac_Too_Cold::In there first stint together, the Trio of Wade, Bosh and James took third place in the World Championship. 2nd year together they took 2nd place in the NBA, maybe 3rd time is a charm?
28NYjets::Um, this is only their second year. how has no one else noticed that?
sirmacalot2::Coach K or Larry Brown..........Who's a better coach?
stone419::thats a stupid argument, he hasn't coached in the NBA,but he has won a gold medal.
Cadillac_Too_Cold::How many NBA Championships has Coach K won?
mintzerkj4eva::Are you lost?
Eternal_Sage::omg are you people this desperate?
Cadillac_Too_Cold::i'm trying to offer hope and optimism that they're getting better, omg are you that defensive?
-whoa-::Kobes 81 point game 28-46 also had 6 rebounds, 2 assists  Wilts 100 point game 36-63  Kobe 61% Wilt 57%
sirmacalot2::What was Wilt's 3 point percentage? EXACTLY. He got his from the line and from the post. And I don't think they tripled Kobe. Like I said, you don't know $@%! about basketball.
-whoa-::idk wilts but kobe was 7-13 from deep
Heatlemaniac....::Wilt camped underneath the rim before there was a 3 second violation while his teammates passed him the ball everytime and dunked on skinny white guys. Have to give it to Kobe for a greater performance. I still hate Kobe though
-whoa-::and this does not make u a great player kobe&gt; wilt kobe is top 5 with ease
-whoa-::did he get a running start?
sirmacalot2::ANd he used to dunk from the free throw line for free throws before they banned it. Shoe Salesman did it once and it's the greatest dunk of all time. And there was a 7 foot 3 guy that played and he sucked. I like how people like to believe that after Wilt, 7 footers grew on trees. There were plenty, but like now a lot of them suck.
-whoa-::also LA was down by 15 at the half and kobe went to work and got them the lead and won single handedly
nba is the worst::And lebron's best - also vs the raptors with 56 pts on just 50% FG shooting - AND THEY LOST!
coop0853::Looks like Lebrons been taking free throw shooting lessons from Dwight...1-4 what's up with this?
dan torell::Lebron's Tired!
mintzerkj4eva::Its so off and on. Its hard to watch
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::<b>Boston Celtics will win the Championship this year and thats all there is to it. Enjoy the regular season while it last!</b>
Heatlemaniac....::Hop back in your Delorean and go back to 2008
THE B.E.A.S.T. - PART 9::So you support Garbage Pierce
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::no thanks, I'd rather stay in 2012 and watch the Celtics eliminate the Heat from the playoffs if the Bulls dont do it first
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::So IF kobe rode shaq's coattail Then both Dwade and Lebron did too...   With Shaq  Kobe 3 Dwade 1 LBJ 0...still  So either way..Kobe is still better lol
THE B.E.A.S.T. - PART 9::I call BS Kobe = Shaq in his prime playing ahead of Kobe Wade = Shaq on the decline while playing behind Wade Lebron = Rusty Shaq while playing behind Lebron  There was no coattail factor with wade or lebron. There was for Kobe
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::Lebron will never get a ring unless he joins the celtics
Clenbutador::Actually it was mostly Zo defense that shut down the Mavs offense.  Shaq was riding Wade offense and Zo's defense for his 4th ring.
sirmacalot2::Zo was focused
nba is the worst::Lol - ft ref jobs didn't "shut down" anything
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::Quick someone say Dwade won a finals MVP tho!!! hurry before im right!!!!!!
Eternal_Sage::bs
Eternal_Sage::wade's shaq was just as good as kobes.. I mean really???
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::you mean the stats arent true??
arcticnorth63::Bulls win the championship this year with 1 great player and some good players.  Heat go down again this year with 3 great players.
Eternal_Sage::lol some good players so boozer, deng, and noah are not all-stars?
arcticnorth63::Like I said, GOOD, not GREAT like Wade and Bosh.  They both scored 25-28 points per game on their teams.
brandonlee561heat::Thank you, Ms. Cleo.
sirmacalot2::She was a fraud. The accent was fake too.
arcticnorth63::You don't have to be Ms. Cleo (btw, whatever happened to her?)  You just have to be a basketball fan.
nba is the worst::Like a Bosh:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVT02qf3PsA&amp;feature=fvst
mintzerkj4eva::Like a BOSH
brandonlee561heat::That was classic, haha
nba is the worst::Especially Javie falling for it hook, line, and sinker
Clenbutador::28 shots, 16 points. Who am I?
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::I thought it was Carmelo
-whoa-::he also scored 48 on 31 shots, whereas lebron shoots 21 times and comes out with 18 and shoots 27 shots and comes out with 31
THE B.E.A.S.T. - PART 9::The Black Gardner snake
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::That was a Lebron stat...Heatlemaniac is more like it.. lol
-whoa-::kobe scored 42 on 28 shots yall shooting crack or somethng
Need4Speed95::No I believe you are.  Kobe is overrated.
Eternal_Sage::kobe?
Heatlemaniac....::more like 59 shots 22 points  Kobe Bean Bryant
-whoa-::lebron
sirmacalot2::If he shot it 28 times, it was a blowout and he had 20 assists to go with it.   The other night Kobe shot it 30 times and 6 from the line to score 36 in 36 minutes of play.
Heatlemaniac....::Let Lebron have the All Stars that Kobe and Jordan had, Lebron would have 7 rings by now
sirmacalot2::LeBron wouldn't have got swept with Odom, Fisher, Pau and Bynum with Barnes, Metta, and Shannon Brown in the fold. Oh and Phil coaching. Kobe is so great huh?
stone419::it doesnt count?
nba is the worst::That was a chemistry meltdown - N/A
JKovacsbaby::they will not win it this year i promise. lebron is destined for failure now after he left cleveland like a $@%!$
JKovacsbaby::yeah lets just give them a SHAG like center so that they have their own starting allstar team on one roster.....
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::Who cares! Lebron cant even play well with the All Stars he has. who are you to say he'd have any rings?
nba is the worst::No true great scored 8 pts in a Finals game when healthy
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::the Celtics were together for one year and won a championship. stop with the excuses
Eternal_Sage::THEY BEEN TOGETHER FOR 1 FREAKING YEAR
brandonlee561heat::I wish the Heat had somebody even half as good as Shaq at the Center position.
Cadillac_Too_Cold::He had Shaq, fresh off an ALL STAR year.
sirmacalot2::He had I want to try and get 1 more ring than Kobe shaq. The Shaq that game in out of shape and was injured for 70% of the season. Thanks for trying.
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::Wade and Bosh arent enough?
stone419::no way is wade better than pippen, especially at this point in his career
JB_Smoove_Loves_The_Lord::he had shaq and gary payton
Cadillac_Too_Cold::You forgot Mark Mad Dog Madsen
arcticnorth63::Grant LOL!!!!  Wade won a championship by HIMSELF.  Wade's better than Pippen was, by far.
Heatlemaniac....::not like having Pippen, Grant, Rodman or Shaq in his prime
Eternal_Sage::they spent 1 year together give it a rest
-whoa-::wade bosh
-whoa-::if u are really considereing trading wade and ur a heat fan, then u are most certainly bandwagoners from cleveland, come on he is the only respectable player on the roster, he is the only one who is clutch, the only one that has won a championship, trading wade will result in the heat being the worst 4th quarter team in the league, if they already arent.
stone419::the only respectable player on a roster with lebron and bosh? that is straight up ignorant
Clenbutador::Try being objective and realistic.  I want the heat to win the next 5 championships.  The celtics made the mistakes of holding on the Bird, McHale too long and they paid for it for the next decade.
Cadillac_Too_Cold::To his credit, Lebron does have something that Kobe, Jordan, Magic and Bird will NEVER have,.... An Olympic BRONZE Medal
sirmacalot2::Same Larry Brown that chose Darko over Melo was the same Larry Brown that coached that team. I think LeBron got like 12 minutes a game or something crazy like that. Try again. And IIRC, NOBODY wanted to play for them in fear of getting kidnapped. KG dropped out, TMAC, Amare, etc.
brandonlee561heat::Can't wait for this Real Madrid soccer game!
Heatlemaniac....::Jordan, Magic, Kobe, and Kareem have nothing on Lebron.
arcticnorth63::22 championships, 14 MVP's
arcticnorth63::Barkley, Malone, Ewing, James - guys with great talent, but chokers in the clutch.  They lose to Jordan, Olajuwon, Duncan, Bryant - guys who come through when it MATTERS the most.
SomeGuySays::Disagree on Barkley.  He showed up in his Finals appearance.
Eternal_Sage::more jordan choke then bryant. Damn!
Heatlemaniac....::Jordan has choked in the playoffs
THE B.E.A.S.T. - PART 9::6-0
Eternal_Sage::playoffs = finals? you're slipping nba
nba is the worst::That explains the 6-6
Eternal_Sage::bryant has choked too in the finals/playoffs
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::What is big and fast and the best of nothing. Has the strength of a god... but the heart of a mouse. Loves the thing that hurts him the most..himself  Who am I?
THE B.E.A.S.T. - PART 9::Kobe "Shaq's Coattail" Bryant
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::i was gonna say Newt Gangrich
Eternal_Sage::I'm voting for him
-whoa-::lebron i think yall bad guessers
BlkMexMamba_CantWeAllJustGetAlong::YES!!!! unfortunatley.. i have no prize
Eternal_Sage::howard
Heatlemaniac....::Kobe?

sirmacalot2::Where can I go to have a decent basketball conversation? Is there a site?
xrooster::you're on it.  lebron is the greatest. he's infallable.  is that better?
-whoa-::lebron is clutch, he will win 8 championships, he is better than jordan
Heatlemaniac....::check out the Heat Index on ESPN.com
-whoa-::so what u want is to discuss with all the lebron d.ick riders
sirmacalot2::Nah. Just people who know the game unlike you. you're an emotional fan. You want your heroes to play in the city forever and go through thick and thin. Life isn't like that. If you worked at a crappy job and had the chance to leave you'd leave. Basketball is a business first. They are in the business of entertaining. So because of you being an emotional fan, you fail to see the obvious. LeBron is a better player on a worse team. And because he's been that way his whole basketball life, you look up to people like Kobe who played his whole career in an organization that the NBA NEEDS to keep on top. So they get Paus when they shouldn't. They get Magic and Worthy as top picks in the draft when they already had Kareem. So yeah, I want to go to a site where people understand this and also understand that in a team sport, it's not 100% up to one player when the going is rough. You the emotional fan will never understand that.
michgolf1::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRmQyZdfbg
xrooster::i find many of these comments  unexceptable.
Heatlemaniac....::Dont you mean unacceptable?
xrooster::it's lebron speak. you wouldn't understand
Heatlemaniac....::Heat &amp; Clips ALL DAY!!!
michgolf1::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxT46ROgI50
mintzerkj4eva::not like a BOSH
Cadillac_Too_Cold::Trading Wade actually does make sense. The Heat will never have the money to fill out the gaping holes in the roster. The only people who'll be willing to take pay cuts for them are guys who're over the hill. If they can Trade Wade for some solid role players and free up some cap space. They can eventually sign someone like Fisher or Billups down the line to close out the games while getting solid rotation guys at the 1, 2 and 5 spots.
Clenbutador::Don't trade Wade for role players.  Trade Wade for Howard.
Eternal_Sage::.. ir rofl
Cadillac_Too_Cold::That won't happen, Wade is hurt. Magic won't trade for a player on IR.
Clenbutador::If Pat Riley is smart and saw what happened to the celtics 10 years after holding on to Larry Bird instead of trading him, he would trade Wade for Howard or DWill now.
Eternal_Sage::why when both are a free agent?
Eternal_Sage::amnesty miller and you give miller's MLE to Howard or Williams
Clenbutador::Still not enough.  Anmesty miller and the heat is still 10 mil over the cap.
Eternal_Sage::mle ? amnesty miller you get one or the other
Cadillac_Too_Cold::Heat can't afford an upgrade over Eddy Curry, you think Howard or Williams are going to take pay cuts to carry Lebron?
sirmacalot2::Need to free up the cap space.
mintzerkj4eva::Feed the Bosh
mintzerkj4eva::17 in the 4th LIKE A BOSH
brandonlee561heat::<b>FILE A LAWSUIT, LIKE A BOSH</b>
Eternal_Sage::your youtube videos rock!
42philip::Dwayne Wade has more championships than Lebron. And probably always will
brandonlee561heat::Wade is one up on him, its simple math, rofl.
