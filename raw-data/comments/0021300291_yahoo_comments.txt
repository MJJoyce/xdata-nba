WS::Why was Paul yelling at the Cleveland fans?Maybe he should have been paying more attention to the game.I wonder if that's why the fan ran onto the court.
Donald::The Clippers had a bas shooting night against the Cavaliers.  Nobody on their team scored 20 points and two players on the Cavaliers team had twenty points each.  Irving bounced after having a scoring night  against the Hawks--his first in his career.
Clipperdude::Cleveland always seems to have the Clippers number. Good job Cavs, they played hard the whole way and got the win.
Jake::Can't believe Cleveland wasted their #1 pick like that... total fail
Homer Fudd Jr.::The Clippers were somewhat depressed, therefore could not perform as well last night. I understand they couldn't find a decent gay bar or bathhouse in Cleveland. Cleveland don't play that!
James::Wow, almost half time and look at those stats by the cavs #1 OVERALL selection Anthony "The Beast" Bennett: 2 fouls and a turnover. No shots, no points, and no rebounds. Just turnovers and fouls. Way to go cavs!! Every game reinforces this guy is just going to be a bust! Oh, an Brown can't coach, and Grant is way in over his head. I look for a lot of ship jumping at the end of the season and end of contracts!! And, personally, I don't blame them.
Steven McCormick::I don't understand this  . . . how can a team that's 13-7 be losing against a team that's 6-13.    Someone isn't trying very heard.
Clipperdude::Clippers have glimpses of good D in there last few games but need to be more consistent.
Dr. Dinglebutt::Charles Barkley sure looks like a fool now when he predicted the Clippers as WC champs this year. He was smoking good weed that day!
Anton::CP3 has always been overrated. Supposedly the best PG in the game for 3 years now lol...But he can't even get past the 2nd round lol...even with Blake and DeAndre...can we please stop this CP3 bandwagon?
