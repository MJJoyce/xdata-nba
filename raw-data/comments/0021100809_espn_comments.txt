Logicalfan1::Also find it hilarious that the Blazers pull more fans than any other game this day. More than LA vs LA. More than OKC vs Miami.
Logicalfan1::J.J Hickson &gt;!!! Gerald Wallace
stevebowl::How does Johnny Flynn manage a -25 in only 15 minutes? And the backup guards for the Nets scored 20 each? Does Flynn know he's allowed on both sides of the court? Someone tell him the midcourt line isn't an out of bounds marker.
KORNETS::OK GUYS I ADJUSTED MY AVATAR TO SHOW MY SHORTS/ME SITTING.  SO NOW I FIGURED PEOPLE WILL REALIZE IM TALL AND ITS THE PIC THAT THREW PEOPLE OFF, IT TAKES SOME TIME TO CHANGE SO U WONT SEE IT YET.  AND WHOEVER CALLED ME A TROLL GO $@% URSELF IM A DIE HARD NJ NETS FAN HOW THE $@% AM I A TROLL I NEVER SPAM OR ANYTHING
cp3andcompany::Ive been following a betting system called Sportsbettingstar for a few months now. I have made over 3k a month for 3 consecutive months just following this system. It's on the 1st page of Google when you search the words "sports betting system" Thought I would post this for anyone that's looking for a betting system that actually works.
KORNETS::NO U HAVENT, I SEE THE SAME EXACT WORD FOR WORD ADVERTISEMENT POSTED UNDER DIF NAMES ALL OVER ESPN AND ITS ALWAYS THE EXACT SAME $@%!$, BTW THEY DONT COME UP ON GOOGLE AND ITS A SCAM, NO SUCH THING AS A "PAY FOR PICKS GUARANTEEING VICTORY SYSTEM"  THATS HOW U GET SUCKERED BY SOME TOOL
pako1008::this game is so fixed by nba
cdub46::the refs were doing everything possible to let the nets win. Flynn got hammered and there was no call, same with Batum, and anytime anyone went anywhere near kardashian they called a foul.
Logicalfan1::Really? Then I guess it didn't work. If you are trying to fix a game, you'd have the team you want to lose in the Penalty with over 5 minutes left in the game. That was Portland, not Jersey. So if it was fixed I guess they were trying to give NJ the win and Portland was just too much for them.
127decibels::Love to see Felton do well.
KORNETS::hes a scrub, oops forgot caps lock!! HE SUCK!!! THERE MUCH BETTER ;-} LOL
KORNETS::HOW DO PEOPLE SAY NETS SUCK WHEN U KNOW DAMN WELL ANY TEAM, YES THE HEAT, OKC, ANY TEAM, MISSING 5 OF THEI TOP 10 PLAYERS ALL SEASON CONSISTENTLY WOULD SUCK WORSE THEN THE NETS!! WE STILL GOT ONE OF THE BEST ROAD RECORDS AND WE BEAT 12 OUT OF 16 PLAYOFF TEAMS ON THE ROAD!!! ONLY THE HEAT, MAGIC, THUNDER, AND LAKERS WE HAVENT
pdxrovermech::you do realize they're tanking on purpose right?
bfellows9::Lay off the roids, then you will not have to type in caps the whole time
KORNETS::LOPEZ S THE MOST UNDERATE PLAYER SINCE THIS WHOLE REBOUND FLUKE HAPPNED WHEN HE CAME IN OUT OF SHAPE CUZ HE HAD MONO ALL OFSEASON AND HAD A LINGERING ARM INJURY ALL SEASON CAUSING HIM TO HAVE SURGERY AFTER THE SEASON. LOPEZ IS A CAREER 18PT 8REBS 2BLK PLAYER U IDIOTS!! AND WALLACE AND HUMPRIES ARENT ALLSTAR GUYS??
JoseInn Chicago::nope
CBass1317::Dude, their roster is just not very good.  So you guys are missing Lopez, the reboundless center.  We get it.  DWill is the only decent player and he is about to jet.
popitoff12::Get over it.
KORNETS::ITS BULLSHITTT WE GET UNFAIRLY BASHED BY THE MEDIA CUZ ITS THE "TRENDY" THING TO DO.  WE WOULD BE A TOP TEAM 100% HEALTHY, HOW CAN A TEAM THIS GOOD NOT BE?
KORNETS::PLUS WE SHOULD OF WON THE LAKER GAME AND THE THUNDER GAME
Chuloflow::Blazers got the Bucks on Saturday,They BETTTERRRR WIN!!!!!!!!!    -Knicks fan
Orckrast::They will!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
127decibels::They won't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  - Blazers fan
CBass1317::crazy plus minus numbers.  G Wall with a -38 in his return to Portland.  Thanks for the top 10 pick NJ!
Chuloflow::Rumor is D-WILL blew up the mans Bathroom .....
Sullinger is Whack::NJ up 85-84 with 5 min left and score 3 fu cking point the rest of the mf game? You worthless naggers
dankfranks_155::Since its the NBA thats racist. If it was the WNBA that would be sexist.
dankfranks_155::Unless you wanna throw Knappy headed in there. Then you kill two birds with one stone
cowpoke85::We do love our chalupas!!!
pdxrovermech::i hate when people start chanting for chalupas. root for your team not and overrated 99 cent taco. i end up giving them away anyways because i know they're going to look the same coming out as they did going in.
KORNETS::HOWS THIS FOR A SHOCKING STAT: FARMARIS HAVING A CARERR YEAR TOP 5 IN 3PT AND FT SHOOTING, PLUS U WONT BELIEVE THIS BUT FARMAR IS ONE OF 4 NBA PLAYERS WHO FOR HIS CAREER WHEN HES A STARTER AVERAGES AT LEAST 17PTS 7ASTS 3REBS 1.5 STLS ALONG WITH DWILL, CP3, AND JOHN WALL!  OH YEA AND A 18 PER!!
127decibels::If you push that little "caps lock" button, you'll be able to calm down a bit.
KORNETS::REALLY? SO WALLACE FOR A PICK WE MIGHT STILL KEEP IS STEALING? SOUNDS LIKE UR BITTER!!
CBass1317::You won't keep the pick.  Maybe you keep it this year, but then it moves on to next year.  Meanwhile, D Will leaves next year, and Nets get to pay Wallace's 11 mil player option while still missing the playoffs.  Great plan.
KORNETS::IM A CPA WHO WORKS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE DEPT OF TREASURY, IF U CAN DO WHAT I DO ID GIVE U PROPS
KORNETS::I HAPPEN TO BE VERY INTELLIGENT AND AS LONG AS IM CONSISTENT WITH THE CAPS LOCK IT SHOUDLNT MATTER
uwlanders::KORNETS - REALLY? SO WALLACE FOR A PICK WE MIGHT STILL KEEP IS STEALING? SOUNDS LIKE UR BITTER!!  Not even close.  Wallace is on the decline and Batum needed more minutes, and is only 23.  You a tin, tiny chance of getting a top 3 pick, and even you should know that wont happen.  And typing in caps is making you look even less intelligent.
uwlanders::Sure is translating into a lot of W's huh?  But at least you will get a good pick for having a terrible year, oh wait we stole that from you too huh?
popitoff12::Cool, he had some games. Why are the nets constantly bad then? Got this All-Star squad with starter caliber bench players.
dankfranks_155::Theyre in the east. You can be awful in the East and still get in the playoffs
popitoff12::You got starters off the bench, remember?
KORNETS::CHECK MY FIRST REPLY AND THINK AGAIN
popitoff12::That's why you're in the playoffs?
KORNETS::THE STATS DONT LIE THE PLAYERS ARE VERY GOOD AND U KNOW IT
KORNETS::UMMMM INJURIES!!!! IT LOOKS GOOD UNTIL THEY DONT PLAY TOGETHER!!
KORNETS::WHO SAID FARMAR ISNT STARTER QUALITY?
Hawaiian Raiders::FIXED, up by allot....the money was on the under and they new it...
KORNETS::POSSIBLE THE WAY IT WENT TONIGHT, ON THE BLAZERS PART I CAN SEE IT, AND DWILLS PHANTOM STOMACH VIRUS
Hawaiian Raiders::With 32 seconds left you go for a three...WTF...
Hawaiian Raiders::Your going to win the game and shoot a three.....WTF..I guess there still was a shot clock, but normally you would eat the clock if you have that much of a lead...
hhk6::He had to get chalupas
joshie2323::wow lost by a half of point nba is rigged ive come to the conclusion...
joshie2323::it seriously is rigged think what u want though he didnt have to shoot that three and how do they always come so close to the over and under seems fishy to me
Hawaiian Raiders::Yes it is, but when you pick a play they rig it.....Vegas has lost allot of money and trying to get it back, one rig after another...
what-else-is-new::true...gambling is a sickness
dankfranks_155::And yet you keep shovelin your money iin
what-else-is-new::u mother $@%!$@%  u couldnt stay under 1 pt 2 nd half... $@%!
sprtsfan2020::And that's why i bet $3 on this BS game, I still hav money left over for my big-mac. Peace.
gsin1202::Yayy!!! Covered the over second half by a half point.  Good night everyone!!!
hhk6::good win blaze
uknolman::COVER -9!!!! YES!!!! $3000 in the bank.
Jeff7429::30,000 for me...yeahhh !
BullsFanInMiamiBeach::PURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  OOPS!  SORRY ABOUT THE SPRAY!  HERE'S A MOIST TOWELETTE!  MEOW!!!
Jeff7429::yeah...way to go dude !!!
BullsFanInMiamiBeach::300.000 FOR ME!  MEOW!!!
mattbarkleycriedwatchingtwilight::CHA-LU-PAS!
Red32x::wow the Nets are total garbage
Mets2410::ya what Kornets said. stupid bet
KORNETS::LOST MONEY? GO BET US WITH OUR BEST 2 PLAYERS ON THE SIDELINE AND OUR BACKUP PG OUT TOO
KORNETS::GIVE THE NETS THIER DUE, MAD TALENT ON THE TEAM, DWILL, BLOPEZ, GWALLACE, KHUMPHRIES, MBROOKS, AMORROW, GGREEN, JFARMAR, COMON!!! THATS 8 NBA STARTERS, 5 ALLSTAR CALLIBUR!! AND GREEN IS A FUTURE ALLSTAR
popitoff12::We're not living in the past.  Green is too old to play DLeague last few years. He still hasn't played and there's a reason. Anyone can have a couple games.
KORNETS::REALLY? SO WALLACE AND LOPEZ NEVER WERE ALLSTARS U IDIOT!
uwlanders::Apparently you didn't read my post.  I said that have 1 player that is an all-star now, and one that could be in the future.  Wallace is done for and he only made the all star team when he was givin the ball every play in Charlotte, and lopez is done with his knees and he has a $@%!$@ last season anyway.
uwlanders::1 all star now, maybe 1 future in brooks
KORNETS::AND WHAT THE HELL IS UR POINT ABOUT GREEN IF HE WAS DLEAGUE MVP AND NOW AWESOME? WHO CARES ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO? LOL
KORNETS::SHOWS HOW MUCH U KNOW, FARAMR IS HAVING A CARERR YEAR TOP IN 3PT AND FT SHOOTING, PLUS U WONT BELIEVE THIS BUT FARMAR IS ONE OF 4 NBA PLAYERS WHO AS A STARTER AVERAGE AT LEAST 17PTS 7ASTS 3REBS 1.5 STLS ALONG WITH DWILL, CP3, AND JOHN WALL!
popitoff12::Green was done in the NBA. He didn't play for a couple years. Lopez can barely rebound. Farmar?LOL. Quit being a homer.
Mets2410::Lopez averaged 8+ boards per year his first 2 years. Only last year he was bad at rebounding, he even said he was lazy letting hump do everything and he lost like 20lbs right before the season because he had mono
drueharris09::beef supreme please
uwlanders::Nacho cheese w/ chicken
mattbarkleycriedwatchingtwilight::nacho cheese
BullsFanInMiamiBeach::LO CAL.  MEOW!!!
swami30::backdoor 3 ball
gsin1202::and that shuts down all the under second half bets.  Right on cue.
swami30::game over blazers cover
PLJosh86::Lol, I think Blazers might actually cover.
popitoff12::Blazers did suck with Nate. With Kanales they're respectable.
PLJosh86::Thanks Blazers, phew.
mattbarkleycriedwatchingtwilight::chalupas?
BullsFanInMiamiBeach::BLAZERS HIT 100, FANS GET A LIFETIME SUPPLY OF CHALUPAS FROM TACO BELL.  MEOW!!!
BullsFanInMiamiBeach::THING IS, JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WILL KILL YA.  THEY ARE DISGUSTING!  MEOW!!!
swami30::need some 3's
sprtsfan2020::These two teams are taken turns sleeping on the job.
drueharris09::why aint deron williams playin?
Mets2410::sick
KORNETS::STOMACH VIRUS FROM EATING BAD PUSSYS
Mets2410::I certainly hope not because he is married you know
KORNETS::WOW NETS ARE GETTING SCREWED AGAIN! WHAT A FOUL ON FELTON!! THIS IS BS WAY TOO GOOD TO HAVE THIS RECORD EVEN WITH THE INJURIES!  COMON ANY TEAM WHEREU GOT 3 NBA STARTERS ON THE BENCH  CUZ THE WHOLE STARTING LINEUP IS ALLSTAR CALLIBUR (DWILL, MBROOKS, GWALLACE, KHUMPHRIES, BLOPEZ) THATS A SICK TEAM!! WHEN HEALTHY!! FARMAR, MORROW, AND GREEN WOULD BE TSTARTING ON MOST TEAMS
popitoff12::Green was done in the NBA. He didn't play for a couple years. Lopez can barely rebound. Farmar?LOL. Quit being a homer.
BullsFanInMiamiBeach::YOU WANT SOME CHEESE WITH THAT WHINE, NIMWIT?  MEOW!!!
PLJosh86::Dude, refs are making up for the no-calls earlier that the Nets took advantage of.
gsin1202::I may have to retract my statement about the Blazers second half...
swami30::that guy might get his mcdonald happy meal w/ his $3 dollar bet
sikey3::Last year people thought these two franchises were on the rise, now well they steink
Sullinger is Whack::Fml
Mets2410::I don't know what you guys expected out of the nets, they have no d-will. unless you placed your bets before it was announced that d-will was out
swami30::u need back 2 back 3's form nj
swami30::wow and it might cover -9 lol
mattbarkleycriedwatchingtwilight::game over
what-else-is-new::this gambling $@%! suckssss

BullsFanInMiamiBeach::HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!
swami30::nevermind it went under
swami30::u need some chicken shi t nj 3's for them 2 start fouling
what-else-is-new::its going to go over by 2 pts for the 2nd half...
swami30::sounds about right and under fails by like 3 pts for game
