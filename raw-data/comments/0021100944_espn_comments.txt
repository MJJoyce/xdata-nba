nba is the worst::Classic late-season matchup between 2 teams going nowhere in the playoffs.  I'm rooting for you Pacers, though
hpaschal424::I want to know who that referee is with the really nice combed hair who refed this game last night. He was terrible.
Copious_Fred::Love my pacers but a damn great game. Granger and hibbert were just non factors. But atleast we know David West can step up and take that leadership role going into the playoffs. Philly played great. Wish them nothing but the best of luck.
nba is the worst::Lots of ref help for Philly.  Didn't change anything for the Pacers
Crazy Celtic Fan::Philly did good. Indiana didn't hit the shots they needed to win.  Good job Sixers.

Benzino999::Go Sixers !!!!!
Saintsfan601MS::lol Knicks and Sixers playing Chess...Your move Knicks!!!!
UnsportsManLikeConduct2::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKLAzyWiC4
jcballer016::Damn good game tonight!!!! Sucks my pacers came up a little short but they had their chances. Got to give props to philly they played a great game. def will be rooting for philly in 1st round hope they can somehow knock off mia or chi.........GO PACERS!!!
JuliusSP1::Sixers are gonna get stuck with the Heat again b/c the Knicks are tanking and the sixers have to technically keep winning.   Knicks may actually be able to compete with the Bulls, but still likely lose in 6 or 7.
J-SMOOVE2075::PHILLY VS NEW YORK IN A GAME OF TANKAGE.
KnicksAllday.::snixers, loolololololo, still fighting for a playoff spot, i pity you
masterjoe712::If the Bulls lose the Heat are going to look like idiots resting Lebron
masterjoe712::Yeah but Lebron is a freak if there was anybody in the league that doesn't need rest it is him
Goon-::Russell Westbrook is more of a freak. He has never missed an organized basketball game in his LIFE. High school, college, pro, he has never missed a single game.
jetzyy::don't forget Bosh &amp; Wade with his fake finger injury 2 minutes into the game LOL
Goon-::Spoelstra has looked like an idiot many times in the past and likely many times in the future
Goon-::Knicks and Sixers might both tank to avoid the Heat. Shows you how this league really fears the Bulls... not much at all.
masterjoe712::I hate how analyst concede Bulls in ECF though I mean without Rose they are very beatable and there is no evidence that he will be healthy come playoff time
DaKing0325__::At least Ny has the star power to compete, philly would have no chance
DaKing0325__::It's New York's turn to visit south beach, philly went last year
DaKing0325__::I just hope we can avoid miami, but if we can't i guess we're just gonna have to go out fighting with nothing to lose
Goon-::New York will tank to face the Bulls. They match up better with them than Miami...
1908gocubs::that is mularkey. losing in 5 doesn't equate to matching up well with a team.
picaac15::Everyone matches up better with the Bulls then the Heat.
jetzyy::agreed. It started last night vs Cavs. The Darkside of Sports.
slowlymovingtarget::Charlotte's gonna knock the Heat out in the first round.
Br3tt11::Clever.
PacerFan19a::We didnt want to go into the playoffs on a big winning streak anyway. I say we beat Detroit Mon to clinch the 3 and then rest our players against Chi to gear up for the postseason.
Man Utd Squad::Well said. I just want us to destroy Chicago, though I doubt they will play their starters much either
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::oh well. just win the next one. because a pistons loss would just be.....there are no words to describe what it would be like
jcballer016::Yes we do have homecourt for first round only atlanta can finish with better record and bump us down to five which we would still have homecourt over boston at the 4 because we have better record. One more win though locks up the 3 seed
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::ahh. i got the 2 mixed up, got it
masterjoe712::I actually wouldn't care that much if we fell to five and Chicago was the 1 seed we would still have home court
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::no we dont. we need to win one more or have the hawks lose tomorrow
mattbarton3::uhhhh yeah we already have home court locked up.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::uhh if we were the 5 seed we would not have home court.
Br3tt11::Pistons would have to play like they did against the Cavaliers. Not likely!
picaac15::Miami's worst chance of losing will be in the 1st round if last year shows us anything.  The Sixers were in 4 of the 5 games last year, even jumping out to double-digit leads early, and not holding them.  If a team could hold those leads, Miami could be knocked out early easily
masterjoe712::The Sixers have no chance against Miami but maybe against the bulls
picaac15::Well of course. The Bulls are just a better version of the Sixers where defense comes first and offense ensues.   Miami is just run and gun until there's no hope left for the other team
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::Refs didnt cause the loss tonight. pacers had chance to win the game at end of regulation and didnt, and they had a chance to tie at the end of ot, and missed. refs were not very good tonight, but it all comes down to execution. We had our chances. Its not season ending or all too important, we still have 2 more games to clinch the 3 seed. philly came ready to play
water12345::refs suck in general...their job is to keep games close.  Pacers lost b/c Granger couldn't drop it in the ocean and their plays at the end of the game and OT were terribly executed.
masterjoe712::The problem was all the fouls on the pacers were on jump shots so it was just odd that they were calling it that close
1908gocubs::rofl at people who think the knicks are winning more than 2 games in the 1st round. either way the bulls or heat will tramp the knicks.
JoshNeal91::I'm actually ok with this loss for a number of reasons, but the most important is the psychological benefit it gives the Pacers. Monday they will play the Pistons with the drive to avenger their loss, hopefully winning that match up. Then, they go into the Chicago game with a win and some momentum, hopefully winning that match up as well. All of that leads to momentum heading into the playoffs, which is the most important time to be in the right mind psychologically.
1908gocubs::if it means the pacers beating the heat, id love it too. but honestly i prefer the bulls beating ny, bos and miami. but if you guys want to overacheive thats great too. but they'll be rivals for years
JoshNeal91::I think a Pacers-Bulls eastern conference match up would be awesome. That would be a good series
1908gocubs::possibly, i mean more in the playoffs. on wednesday i wouldnt be surprised. bulls are very rusty.
JoshNeal91::It can happen. The Pacers are a good team and the game will be at home. Still, it'll be tough for them. We'll see I guess
1908gocubs::good luck beating the bulls. lucky they are on the other side of the bracket.
water12345::are they really locked in to the 3 seed?  Atlanta has a 2-1 record against us and they can tie us if they win out and we lose out
masterjoe712::And the knicks are winning tomorrow so its not gonna matter
masterjoe712::They play the pistons monday
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::atl can get it
Goon-::Why did the Pacers even play their starters in this game? They are locked in the number 3 seed.
ftwayne2408::hawks can still get #3 seed if they tie the pacers they get it by beating them 2-1 in the season series.  we do have a det at home and a chicago team that will probally rest some players.  the hawks do take a trip to NYC. where the Knicks want the 7th seed and play the heat.
Br3tt11::Played for the fans I'm guessing.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::no they arent, have to win one more to clinch or have the hawks lose tomorrow
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::no, im just saying if the hawks lose tomorrow, or the pacers win one more game then they have actually clinched the 3 seed. i think no matter what happens they will have the 3 seed
Goon-::You  honestly think the Hawks will win out?
jetzyy::I would rather let Philly take the 7th seed as a knicks fan... I don't want any part of the Heat. I guess it's pick your poison of 1st round loses anyway, but at least Knicks won a game vs Bulls. And those Ref's when Miami's at home are ridiculous....
DaKing0325__::Yup we dealt with it last year, I know the feeling
DaKing0325__::I just hope we avoid Miami
ftwayne2408::the pacers r not scared of either miami and especially chicago  should b fun but business is first put orlando out of their miserable season by not wasting any time with them 4 game sweep
masterjoe712::That bulls game isn't over yet lot of time left
picaac15::Chicago is winning, Miami lost.  Looks like it will be Chicago
Br3tt11::Pacers can't have that attitude. They can match up with most teams with that front court. Much like the Grizzlies.
bluedevils1148::Dude you are so funny..
Br3tt11::Ohh your a 76er fan sorry.
picaac15::This game was great for both teams.  Pacers can lose and regroup before the playoffs, and the Sixers can clinch much easier and get some confidence by finally winning a close game.  It was also a very entertaining game to watch.
yellowdart24::Pretty sure its good to get a loss out of the way after a long run right before the playoffs start so that it can be a wake up call especially for Granger.
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::Pacers are 29th in attendance, but are contenders this year, If the Pacers bring in another star, they should be top 10
Justin54196::There were still a few open seats, but much better than usual. It was definitely playoff atmosphere in there.
cahoffman91::that place was pretty full tonight just sayin
GreyHound914::Top ten in.... attendance? Im just trying to clarify
masterjoe712::Wow I don't want to hear that the Heat is Wades team loses to the wizards without lebron
masterjoe712::Oh I just checked the box score didn't realize he got hurt but it didn't look like lebron played
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::didn't bron play? ppl say he suited up after wade was injured
Br3tt11::Damn Pacers killing the Bucks dreams..
NGplayinskillz::The Bucks Killed The Bucks dreams by Losing to the Washington Wizards.
ftwayne2408::no the Pacers killed the bucks dreams by beating the bucks twice in a week.  bye bucks
Rexanilatorz::You can thank the refs tonight
Br3tt11::Yes, and Larry Sanders was framed. Haha Jk..
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::well i would rather that loss happen now than in playoffs. just start off a new win streak and play hungry next game
PacerFan19a::There was bad calls on both sides of the ball tonight. we lost today because we didnt make enough plays. Its all good though we are still the 3rd seed and i like the Sixers in the playoffs over the Bucks.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::Glad to see someone else who is not blaming the refs as the reason we lost
CoreyGallagherArt::Why? You just beat the Bucks and lost to the Sixers, why would you prefer them then? Unless you just want the best field in the playoffs in which case alright.
PacerFan19a::I like the 76ers better. Philly is also the better team and will have a better shot of knocking off Chicago.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::should be a wakeup call for the pacers and for granger, he has to show up every game. playoffs are just around the corner, cant wait. philly played well tonight also hopefully they can discover their play of earlier and make some noise
Rexanilatorz::Yeah hopefully we don't run into those refs again
saintsmagic88::gg Sixer fans. We may meet again in the playoffs.
masterjoe712::Do 6ers fans want to keep Doug Collins as the coach next year
masterjoe712::You should fire him and hire stan van gunny lol
markjakesamson::depends who you ask, im all for it, hes making the best team out of the talent he has
CoreyGallagherArt::If they don't resign Meeks than sure, he'll have to play Turner then.
huskerdude1212::heck yes
markjakesamson::sixers deserved this one, 1-9 on the year in games decided by 4 or less, finally a close win
DaKing0325__::finally
PacerFan19a::Who was Doug Collins yelling at though?
yellowdart24::The refs for not calling more fouls. They told him before the game, they weren't gonna let it be close but the Pacers still almos beat the 76ers and the refs.
benjhuffman::Terrible calls (5-sec) don't count as fouls.
CoreyGallagherArt::25 fouls a piece...
masterjoe712::The refs Im assuming so he should might have a fine coming his way
y u so mad::76ers fans.... looks like you guys are gonna face the heat in playoffs
yellowdart24::So to put this whole game into the bigger picture of things. Pacers still have the best record in the NBA in April, are going to be the 3 seed and get a Howardless Magic team, and the Pacers clearly played their worst game in weeks, had the refs against them all night (who calls 5 sec calls?), Granger put up like 4 points and they still almost won. I would still much rather be in the Pacers shoes after this game. Philly is getting swept in the first round no matter who they face.
yellowdart24::76ers also played their best game in months Just a bad combo tonight all working against the Pacers
indy500fans::Philly won't be swept, but I don't see them being deep enough to win a first round series.
drjcr1037::We beat a quality team on the road, backs to the wall, we can finish strong and the sweet heat are weak, let's go sixers!!!
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::sweet lou!
Mets_11::Granger 2/12, 4 pts? Misprint?
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::nope. he was awful
indy500fans::He took the night off.
NGplayinskillz::Pacer fans think of it this way. THIS WAS PHILLY's playoff win. They know if they get Miami or Chicago they stand NO CHANCE so they have to try their hardest to beat a Pacers team in the regular season.
CoreyGallagherArt::Last 6 against the Bulls the Sixers are 3-3, avoid the Heat at all cost however and thanks to this Heat loss Philly won't play them first round
indy500fans::Especially if Rose is hobbling around
Rexanilatorz::i hate when refs decide games
NealIndy::Yeah, that "5 seconds" is only about 4 seconds if you time it from the moment he gets the ball to when the whistle is blown. Unbelievable...
PhillyPhever.FlyEaglesFly::I'd say these teams are pretty even and would make for a hell of a playoff series! Good game by both teams!!
benjhuffman::Actually, these teams are pretty even because both teams have above average depth. The difference is when Granger and Hibbert play well, it's hard for Philly to stop the bleeding. Very fun to watch these two teams play, great game. Go Pacers!
ttjnd45::Not even close...there's a reason why you guys are a seven and we are a three. Our best two players had awful games. You were trying to make the playoffs. We were playing for a high seed. I think your guys went a little harder considering what was at stake.
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::agreed
ColtsHoosiersPacersDude::pretty even being the key word, philly was playing extremely good basketball at the beginning of the season and is capable of playing that way, they have lost their way at the end of the year though
iownamicrowave::theyre not even ur high
