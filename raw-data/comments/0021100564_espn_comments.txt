davidms56::If you look at the NBA standings, whomever compiled the info has Philly (9.5) games out above the Hawks (8) games out. Must be a Philly fan I'm thinking...go ahead and update that. I'll wait.
Trade the Hawks Front Office::Top 4 spots go to the 3 division leaders and team with the next best record, in order of their records.  Philly is winning the Atlantic division but has the 4th best record of themselves, Chicago, Miami, and Orlando.    You're going to be waiting a while.... You might want to take that time to look up a few things.
Martin6422::This Atlanta Hawks team plays a much faster ball movement oriented game with Joe Johnson out of the line up. I can see him being phased out next season for the Younger Hawks team. Come home Dwight Howard.
davidms56::Great win, Hawks! I'd been suspect of Larry Drew when he took over, but he's done a good job. Hawks have lots of weapons and scoring 58 in the first half last night was big. Now, on to Miami! We'll need to play great D against the Heat to have a shot. They're surging, but I think we're up to the task.
CandySparker::Hawks Lotta Love!
Eli Langston Katz::Josh Smith, Joe Johnson, Al Horford, Jeff Teague, Marvin Williams.  Zaza, McGrady, Hinrich, Pargo, and the insane Ivan Johnson off the bench... If that lineup is healthy and confident, they can beat the Bulls in a 7 game series, right?
atlkee1787::Yes they can......... Not worried about the bulls. There is only one team to worry about in the east
aftern9ne::It seemed like that might have been the case given the first two matchups against the Bulls, but I'm never too confident in the Hawks.
sagarpateltv::no Joe Johnson, no Al Horford  Josh Smith carrying Atlanta again!  great win hawks!
J-SMOOVE2029::I want us to go get the Birdman from the Nuggets.  Denver is currently shopping him and we could use the frontcourt help.  Not to mention he is the BIRDMAN.  he would fit right in with the Hawks and add some nasty to our team which we will need in the playoffs.
Martin6422::Would rather have Chris Kamen from Hornets
Sixers1234567::"The Bobcats won despite the fact veteran forward Boris Diaw, a regular starter, did not play amid uncertainty surrounding his future with the team."  "Charlotte president of basketball operations Rod Higgins confirmed Tuesday night that he met with Diaw recently about the veteran's expiring contract. Higgins said Diaw's agent, approached him about the possibility of a trade or buyout that would allow his client a chance to move to another team this season."
Martin6422::Nah, He doesn't like to bath and Sund had nothing to do with that draft.
Sixers1234567::I can see Diaw going back to Atlanta once he gets bought out to help them while Horford is out. Remember Diaw got drafted by the Hawks and started his career there. I can see him going back to help their playoff run.
chemeute::Idiots actually voted for Gingrich. Georgia and SC are the laughing stock of America.
aftern9ne::Idiots actually voted for all four of those candidates today. Nobody gets away scott free here.
texasrocks123456::I guess with Peyton Manning gone the Pacers felt the pressure of being the best team in the state.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::what do pacer fans think of manning gone?
texasrocks123456::Next stop, Miami, where we won by 7 last time.
IlliniDave68::Damn, Pacers!  You got punked by the Hawks, AT HOME?!
THA TRUTH 365::SMITH OR JOHNSON, SOMEONE HAS TO GO.
Trade the Hawks Front Office::If they could find a way to swing that trade and keep Marvin Williams I'd give them a shot at a title.  Too bad there is no way Orlando will send Dwight somewhere in the Southeast Division.
Justinisasi::Any decent owner would amnesty Joe and use that money to try and lure a superstar.  Can you imagine if Howard became a free agent. Amnesty Joe, offer D12 max money... you might get him and form the best front-court in the league.  Teague, Greene, Smoove, Horford, Howard..... we would never give up an offensive rebound again.
Trade the Hawks Front Office::Joe Johnson needs to be traded
Eli Langston Katz::In reality... Joe Johnson CANNOT be traded Josh Smith CAN be traded sigh...
J-SMOOVE2029::joe johnson should be traded  josh smith should NOT be traded
__Megatron__::Bulls and heat are the only teams that matter in the east. There rest = TRASH
kemurph.::the other teams matter so little ESPN can't even get the standings right... it has Philly in 4th right now and Indy in 5th despite pacers at 23-14 and Philly at 22-17.
J-SMOOVE2029::that is the old rule dude.  division leaders dont matter anymore unless we are talking about a tiebreak situation.
Jezeble::That's because Philly are leading their division. The top 4 slots are held by the 3 division leaders and any other team with the requisite record. So if Pacers want to get in, you have to have a better record than Orlando. Understood?
LarryTheShu::The Pacers attendance is embarrassing. I'd rather have them leave than make the city look bad the way that it does.
Jezeble::Don't worry. When the Bulls come to town, you'll be sold out.
Grant-Coleman::even my charlotte bobcats who are 5-31 has better attendance
Toomersforever::Another good win for the hawks.  Now on to Miami for a real test. Go Hawks.
cellus24::That josh smith dunk was so sick. you know that's gonna be on sportscenter top ten he was way over paul george's head it was insane http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Tcx3LMRN9k
Leisiago::hoax
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::now they use david west when he was feasting on boozer all last game? come on now....thats a noob move
Rick-Da-Villain::Pacers are expose now..they'll fall to the 8th seed before the season is over..hahahahahahaha ..better team my assssssss
nblucas97::I don't think they are "expose" for anything. Personally as a Pacer fan, they are above my expectations.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::pacers are way too slow to keep up with faster teams and have no scorers. i could've told you how to expose this team. pacers usually play great d, just cant score
Jezeble::Collison is pretty fast. He sets the tempo. Besides, in the Playoffs the pace slows down, so that's in your favor.
vangundyfan12::Hawks Trade Joe Johnson and Marvin williams for Dwight and Hedo.
Justinisasi::It's not greedy... its what it takes to make the numbers work... Joe's contract makes everything nearly impossible.
THA TRUTH 365::IT'S GONNA TAKE AT LEAST 2 PLAYERS TO GET HOWARD ALONE
Trade the Hawks Front Office::Johnson, Williams and Pachulia for D12 and Hedo
HeatFan85::*AND Hedo? thats a lil greedy dont u think?
greenbean47::Hedo is a liability these days.
windy.city.assassin::Pacers' wack.
york15york::lin was gonna be traded to the raptors..... imagine if that happened  http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
rapshow19::imagine what? lins a junkster jose dominates his show
Sonic_speed1::SMH why would u wanna trade a 6 time all star?
burchboy21::SMH He's overpaid and can't stay on the court. We're pretty much paying someone to not play. His PPG should not be lower than what he's making a year if you're a shooter.
best_man_for_the_GOB::because he's not an all-star anymore.
atlhawks27::PACERS GOT UGLY CHEERLEADERS
kemurph.::*doing
AtlantaWarrior77::$@%!$ i'm dating 1 right now
best_man_for_the_GOB::Why you typing in CAPS? annoying.
AtlantaWarrior77::http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/219120/Marvin_Williams_Would_Like_Trade_From_Hawks
vangundyfan12::Worst trade in history.
atlhawks27::THE HAWKS SHOULD TRADE MARVIN WILLIAMS AND JOE JOHNSON FOR PAUL PIERCE NO LIE
Sonic_speed1::Terrible trade
atlhawks27::AND HE IS CONSISTENT
atlhawks27::BUT HE SCORES 20 POINTS A GAME
AtlantaWarrior77::he is to damn old
atlhawks27::THE HAWKS SHOULD TRADE MARVIN WILLIAMS AND JOE JOHNSON FOR PAUL PIERCE NO LIE
atlkee1787::Thats the dumbest sh.it I ever heard in my life
darwinislord::Bad loss for the Pacers. You've got to be able to beat the Hawks at home.
Toomersforever::pacers are decent . . . But they would  also be a great first round playoff match-up for us. Not enough "winning" experience on their roster. But they will get better.  Go Hawks.
fordt987::Hawks are 2-1 against the Pacers this season, and this time our "star" player didn't play.
aftern9ne::Josh is approaching JJ's PPG, and has better all-around stats. If anybody deserves that massive contract it's Josh Smith.
atlhawks27::THE HAWKS NEED A SUPERSTAR AD GET RID OF JOE JOHNSON
atlhawks27::THE BRAVES ARE THE TEAM I THINK THATS GONNA BE GOOD FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS SO WILL THE FALCONS
AtlantaWarrior77::few years from now atlanta teams will be on top, ALL THEY NEED ARE SOME GOOD COACHES
aftern9ne::Nolan and Koetter will be a shot in the arm for the Falcons.
jbfreeman62::Correct Mike Smith is a good coach but we need good coordinators for the dirty birds
atlhawks27::IT FEELS LIKE THE HAWKS BEEN WINNING EVERY GAME AND WE ARE STILL THE 6TH SEED L0L
jbfreeman62::We're only a 1/2 game back at this point though and have a better record than the sixers
jbfreeman62::Hawks will be running into a buzz saw tomorrow in Miami hopefully we can compete though
atlhawks27::I MEAN 12-6 AT HOME 11-9 AWAY
atlhawks27::THE HAWKS ARE A BALANCE TEAM 12-9 AT HOME 11-9 AT AWAY
AtlantaWarrior77::22 games left until season over?
atlhawks27::LAKERS GAME TIED
atlhawks27::I HOPE KNICKS LOSE
atlhawks27::CELTICS COMING BACK TO BEAT ROCKIES
atlhawks27::LAWL LAKERS LOSSING TO THE PISTONS
Sonic_speed1::Kobe hit a game tying shot
atlhawks27::I PERSONAL THINK WE ARE GONNA LOSE TO THE HEAT THATS WHY THIS GAME WAS IMPORTANT BUT WIF WE BEAT THE HEAT I WONT BE SURPRISED
AtlantaWarrior77::it's a back 2 back i doubt it
J-SMOOVE2029::So, we have won 3 in a row vs Pacers, Bucks, Thunder.  Bring on the Heat I guess!!!!!!!!!!
atlhawks27::TO BE HONEST ALL THE HAWKS NEED IS 30 WINS TO GET INTO THE PLAY OFFS
atlhawks27::HOW MANY WINS DO WE HAVE WITHOUT AL?
AtlantaWarrior77::i really want al back :(
jonkaylau777::REVENGE FOR INJURING ALL-NBA AL
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::That was taken care of awhile back, by the way I loved you on The Wire".
AtlantaWarrior77::do the hawks have a better record away than home? TROLOLOL
