Orlandomagic2323::I like how Turks been dishin the ball lately, looks like hes coming out of his slump
openminded43::Don't win many games only giving 1 quarter's worth of EFFORT!!!
glenn1234291::I think the problem is Stephen Jackson, Scott Skiles and the most important is that NBA players nowdays are wimps!!!!! A sprained wrist would never keep Jordan or anyone else out of a game!! Then you have Bogut who cant keep himself healthy. He is turning into Yao Ming!! Always hurt and not worth anyones time!! Bucks should trade Stephen Jackson, Ersan, Jennings and Gooden and try to get Howard, Nelson and Turkoglu. Milwaukee might have to include a few draft picks as well!! Next fire Scott Skiles!!!! He was worthless when he was the coach of Chicago he is worthless now. Then Bogut try to trade him for someone like Kaman and a backup point guard.
AParcell123::So which is it, does Orlando like Howard or not?
Shadow_Boxer_WVU::feel sorry for people who bet Bucks it sucks to out play the other team for 39 minutes then lose the lead in the last 3min and then not even cover the 7.5 your getting...But I feel better for me because I won..
milw-jay::Most teams in the league will lose most of the time if playing without their best player. Bogut is the Bucks best player, but he is out indefinitely. So, wins will be few and far between.
the702shogun::keep it up magic, finally playing some good basketball. condolences to big baby on the loss of his dad.
gdfgdfgfdgdfgfdg::JENNINGS 4-20 SMOKE WEED ERYDAY
ONEVOICE18::QUIT SPREADING RUMORS ABOUT CHICAGO HAVING HIGH GAY COMMUNITY...ONLY NEW YORK AND ORLANDO IS KNOWN FOR SUCH PEOPLE..SO STOP SPREADING FALSE FACTS...
Magicmike321::What the hell brought this up??  Are you feeling out of place in Chicago or something?
ElArtman1973::yea? and san fran isnt?
z_man0789::woooooooo!!!!
lehmanator123::Damn Jennings shot 20% tonight lol
MagicBoltzRays::because Nelson was guarding him.
brohani::now she does it like this when you do her like this  now if she touches like this will you touch her like that?  now if she moves like this will you move her like that?    cmon shake shake shake shake shake it
Stan Van Gundy Rulez::Orlando should sign Iverson give a bit more depth at the point in the playoffs against  guys like Jeff Teague or Darren Collison.
dave19741997::Next up Miami. We did it last time we met,we can do this again. Let's go Magic!!
Dax_factor::Revenge time for the Heat. Magic spoiled their road trip so the Heat will spoil theirs.
z_man0789::an absolute fool!!! lol
dave19741997::Just got home from work. Way to go Magic!!
korn7860::Bucks will trade Ilyasova and SJax before the March 15th deadline.  Maybe bring back turk from the Magic, would fit the Bucks style.  What they really need though is to lose the depth, we have one starter in Jennings, and 13 role players, trade 3-4 of the role players for a starter and a role player, heck if you have to trade a future pick, but having 13 people that are all similar is just a chemistry disaster, there is no solid 8-10 man rotation.  Also they really have to get a go to player, someone like J-Rich would be nice, or Monta Ellis if the Warriors are ready to build for next year and take Bogut on as they have been rumored.
korn7860::The Bucks are a solid team, thing that stinks, they cannot put together 4 quarters of basketball.  Sick of seeing this every night, 40 solid minutes of basketball and 8 min stretches each game where we shoot 10%
choate_sedition::Howard should shoot more than 12 times a game - if the magic want to keep him the first step is to fire Van Gundy
trizzo23::but flopping on other end is a foul?? cant have it both ends?
korn7860::I think to many player pout, back when I played, being touched wasnt a foul, being held down or hit was a foul, Dwight is a little dramatic and whines way to much, be strong, go up, slam it down, and stop crying.  Maybe then, he can get the respect of the refs like Shaq, but Dwight whines about Brock rubbing against his arm and going straight up, thats not a foul, (unless you are QQBRON BRON who gets all calls)
trizzo23::if you count times he was fouled its 20 shots....and add the times he got fouled with no call...i mean they say turnover....
korn7860::You know, I want to feel the same way with this, but watching Howard, he is just flat out to light to back people down and secure good position, he is not your typical banging post player who can demand the ball.  He has to get his points from rebounds and fast breaks.
trizzo23::hey dummy..  ''you play to win the game'' stan is a top 5 nba coach...learn the game before you write
MagicalDiesel::Stephen Jackson will be traded to Orlando near the deadline
MagicBoltzRays::ewww. Jackson is terrible.
Winning .::Bucks are failures. I could play better ball.
jmoneyisback::I GOT THIS.  NEXT
palanador21::I didn't know that Shaun Livingston was back in the league..  That's good to see.
BigCheese4::Stephen Jackson limited minutes tonight, how long before he goes mental.
prestidu::Please trade Jackson, he is a bench warmer, but we can still get something out of him
z_man0789::jones for dallas dribbles around waaay to much. pass the ball!
shasud88::F ya BUCKS!!!!!!!!!  TANK FOR THE UNIBROWED MR.DAVIS!!!  cant wait for the draft!!!  MKE BUCKS NBA CHAMPS 2017!!!!
prestidu::never gonna happen
WhoseMamaYourMama::Well Mr. Jennings, I hope you do keep your options open after the season because I hope as a Bucks fan you leave cause your 4-20 shooting is not worth the money.
Go Home FIBs Go Home FIBs::I despise that cocky piece of trash.  I would rather watch a 90 year old John Stockton play point than him.
Torron21::take these @nd stringers out .. they suck ... show no mercy heat !!!!!
screwhead2305::and what happened to gooden
gumbyr2424::If the Bucks were smart, they would wait till Jennings got on a hot streak, then try to trade him for the best possible package they could get.
qufatal::Yeah, and trade Illysova, while his value is high right now.
gumbyr2424::Definitely.. they should be in tank mode. They need to get their hands on one of the two franchise changing big men that are gonna be in the draft.
screwhead2305::jennings 4-20???
z_man0789::wow
TheSportsDude2011::I hope DHoward goes to the city of angels...CANT WAIT.
WatkinsUSMC::BOOO THIS GIRLL....

dkleist184::I wonder if Jennings gave it his all tonight
tampasportsrule::BUCKS FANS DID YOU ALL THINK YOU HAD A CHANCE TONIGHT AGAINST THIS MAGIC TEAM ? ONLY A MORON WOULD HAVE BET ON THAT. NEXT.
Rattmausch::I'm a bucks fan but I agree, anyone who thought the Bucks actually were gonna win tonight would of definitely been a moron.  This team has horrible chemistry, no heart, and an organization that doesn't care and uses the "small market" excuse for being mediocre, it's pathetic.
blackzilla24::now its time to watch linsanity
blackzilla24::17-0 run what
Warren56847::bucks fans too happy to soon--I've been on the other end of a bunch of these,as most anyone who follows NBA knows thehy can go like this
wwsi pprofit::how pathetic PRO PLAYERS  cant score 1 point in 6 mins way to go bucks
dpackrules::PLAIN AND SIMPLE.. This team $UCK$!  They have no finisher and jennings is a head case!  ONCE AGAIN the season is over. How many games have they choked in the 4th??  As long as Kohl owns this team they will NEVER do squat!!!   Skiles has to go!
