santi2513::Ha! lakers suck, suck suck suck suck. And so do you, mods. Yeah, if you little $@%!$ are on this board right now delete this, you mahfukkin dikks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
mr mellow::I like Damian Lillard he's a player.  Already in the record book as a rookie with Oscar Robertson and Isaiah Thomas.
mttap09::The Lost Angeles Fakers are OVERRATED!
virtu11b::I always enjoy watching the Laker lose in Portland.
Mannymamba24::lakers haters enjoying this moment while you can. Lakers will get better with time.
Cameron46500::People. The fakers are now 0-10 going back to the preseason. 0-11 if you go back to last season. An 11 game losing streak? Really? If the fakers are going to make it to the finals they'll have to make NBA history. NO TEAM HAS EVER made it to the finals after not winning a single preseason game.
sean3653::i have to say mike brown may not be the best coach but he seems like a nice guy pretty genuine
Obuchons::Starting line up looks nice on paper! But that bench is AWFUL!
timechange064::The Lakers stink
ntap897::need to trade every one and rebuild, seasons over, fire jerry west and fire the coach, prolly just move the team to seattle
bobj885::*Phone is ringing* Kupchak: Who's there? Phil Jackson: LET ME TAKE CHARGE
sean3653::i wish
redwingstevie::Too bad it can't be 0-82.
The Dallas Cowboys have 5 SuperBowl Titles End of Discussion::chirp41   I love watching the Lakers lose. If they were playing the Taliban, I would be grow a beard and be all in for the Ban'. ---------------------  WOW!!!!
OPL21stJS::Lakers are overrated and cant believe ppl think they can make it to the finals. They have no depth, and are old. Look at nash Also Nash doesnt seem right playing off the ball. The trade was a fail because Nash and Kobe cant play together. Dwight can be a consistant scorer and rebounder, Nash can feed Dwight and Gasol, and give them good looks.  But theirs only 2 scorers on that $@%!$@ team.
sean3653::gasol sucks we were originally going to trade him in CP3 trade but that didnt fall hes overrated, weak in the post
Mr372::2-0 baby...we are gonna make it to 73 wins, no problem....
brownbear541::whos 2-0? the lakers are 0-2... on pace for 0-82
eightbitme::I'll take that bet!!! Oh, you're only kidding.  :-(
mgerman642@aol.com::basketball is a TEAM game.  3 guys won't cut it.   For the lakers to do anything they have to get everyone involved
sean3653::calm down its 2 $@%!$@% games miami started out bad too shut up
dsysler99::only 1... Kobes numbers have gone down #tooold
Anay678::ummmm 30 points? i think u need to get out more
Dallas Mavs Where Plan Z is Greater than Plan A::Lakers have 4 guys.. i understand Pau and Nash are not superstars.. Lakers really have only 2 stars
phenioxfan99::Steve Nash is a P.u.s.s.y.
sean3653::i blame mike brown ik nash is better than sessions and fisher combined la can go 73-9 we need a system tho
OPL21stJS::i actually always loved Nash, but i dont like that hes a Laker. Nash is just too old now.
brownbear541::look i know you're upset he's a laker. i think its weak too. but be honest. he's not a pu ssy. wow...
rockstar on mars::The Lakers need to start making some major changes in their offensive and defensive strategies. What they're doing isn't working.
51jord::Lakers will get better as the season goes on
Shiggity80::Wow, D.Howard was a beast last night.
Vanessa87687::Sheesh, he spent the night at the free throw line on bail-out calls.  He's not 100%. He's moving stiffly and not as quick reacting on defense.  He was very tentative in his effort to save a turnover out of bounds.  He was not a beast, he was a good free throw shooter last night.
Zarlbane28::The entire blazers starting line up was a beast last night.
socialsatyr11::"In order for me to win, I need one more element to compete every night - LeBron."  ---Mike Brown overheard speaking on his cell phone
HeatManZE.....::kobe ball hogging last nite again

elibird4321::^^Dumb
jayraldratuita@gmail.com::Thanks for admmiting :-)
Thomas31::HAHAHAHAH....Now 0-10 in the last 10 games.....HAHAHAHAHAH!!!  They're the new Bobcats...
sean3653::8 of those were preseason 0-2 moron when steve gets back well figure out a system and do ok
elibird4321::Did you fall and bump your head?
cubsfan33442::Lost in all the crap about the Lakers is that the Blazers actually looked decent yesterday.
brownbear541::decent? they looked pretty good last night... lilard and batum man.. wow
ESPN-Miami::why is that fatasss on Xfactor now
Infinite5ammy::FUN FACT: The Lakers are a huge joke.
sean3653::yesterday night
sean3653::dwight has no postgame but hes too strong like shaq but shaq was way better not comparing them and he dropped 33 tonight, i agree with everything else tho except kobe not knowing how to play w/o the ball in his hands
sockmedock::they just have a horrible coach, a center with no post game, a lack of shooters, a hof pg that isnt being allowed to dominate the ball, and a superstar that doesnt know how to play without the ball in his hands!   those are the real facts
THE ROCK.::Still hoping its Heat vs Lakers in the finals beating the Lakers makes it much sweeter so the idiot Lakers fans can shut up (:
elibird4321::I bet it would. Just like the rest of you Lakers hating brethren. Deep down inside it all about jealousy and envy......lol  The Los Angeles Lakers are the measuring stick for all teams success.
elibird4321::Juwan Howard has more rings than you - i suspect you still ride on the short bus *********************** Obviously you would, since I was talking about the concept of the entire NBA league fans chanting <i>Beat L.A.</i>, due to the team's historical success and you come back with the Lakers starting the 82 game season 0-2 as a put down on the Lakers franchise success. Therefore your, <i>"You still ride the short bus!</i> statement is to be expected from you. I am most surprised you did not end that comment with some other silly childish put down; such as one of my grandchildren's favorites.....<i>Stone Head!</i>
Juwan Howard has more rings than you::i suspect you still ride on the short bus
elibird4321::<b><i>16 Championships....bioatches!......That's called being a successful franchise......man you two guys are just stupid. You were the little yellow bus kids I would suspect</i></b>
sockmedock::success?  you are ignorant!
Juwan Howard has more rings than you::0-2 is team success lmao
elibird4321::What's that little chant you all do?......  Beat L.A....Beat L.A...Beat L.A.........LMAO! ;)
Juwan Howard has more rings than you::it would be too easy, the clippers would put up more of a fight
Juwan Howard has more rings than you::they should put it on sportscenter
THE ROCK.::I saw what you put on " 5 reasons to justify the Lakers 0-2 start " LMFAO
Sam Tingey82::Damian Lillard is awesome.  Rookie of the Year!  I loved watching him last year at Weber State.
OPL21stJS::No, Lillard will be ROY.
Mobz24::He looks really good. Although the Lakers have a tendency to make guys like him look like an all-star.
CallMeJohnD::What if this whole time Kobe actually had to shoot terrible for the lakers to win
elibird4321::Good thing he really is a good shooter.
elibird4321::If you really understood percentages you would he is a career 45 % field goal shooter. 10 for 20 = 50% 9 for 20 = 45%  I hope this helps
CallMeJohnD::wouldn't say that. he rarely shot over 45% the last couple seasons. This year though hes been excellent so far
brunick1::Batum &gt; Kobe
sean3653::lmao the wade one was a good joke, wade isnt good lol

Team Nickel::LAKERS ARE IN SHAMBLES
ESPN-Miami::Lebron should fart on dwights face while he's in the air dunking on him
36Sly::Breaking News! Mike Brown apologizes for the Princeton offense! “I thought I was installing the Prince offense, as in Prince, the pop star” Brown said. “I saw an episode of the Chappell show and Prince dominated Eddy Murphy’s brother. My intent was to install a system of glam-fem-rock to our basketball team. After all, ours colors have purple in it. Purple. Like, purple rain! Get it?” The Lakers coach blamed the mix-up on a failed google search. Coach Brown was then asked about the Ivy League system he was accidentally installing. “Ivy? I hate Ivy! Prince hates Ivy too!” After a brief intermission of Brown pretending to dance like Prince while itching himself as though he had poison ivy, he then explained the new system he was planning to install. “It’s going to be a hybrid with the MJ offense. MJ was the greatest ever! He then said in sing-song that sometimes all you have to do is look at the “man in the mirror and ask him to CHANGE HIS WAYS.”  -we all hope you can.
sean3653::brown is high
x_chip_douglas_x::just wait, this laker team is going to be great. I want everyone to remember i had no doubt about this even during the early struggles.
elibird4321::Cool you're on record. It's only been 2 games with them playing together. They will get it together and start whipping a$$  All these little jokesters will be nowhere to be found. <i>He who laughs last, laughs best!</i>

BaySports226::I wonder if Batum finally lives up to expectations this year?  Would be nice.
Innoncentuntilprovenguilty::putting steve nash with kobe and a C with no offensive game who on earth thought this chemistry would work?
sean3653::2 losses not 82
x_chip_douglas_x::33 points?
Innoncentuntilprovenguilty::0 wins
theotherguy76::Don't panic Lakers fans. They just need time to gel and they will as the season goes.  Don't forget, it took time for Lebron, DWade, and Bosh to gel when they first started in Miami.  LAKERS WILL WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP THIS YEAR!
sean3653::lololololol im a laker fan and thats so true tho but yeah the comments right idk about championship but they'll gel well its not melo and amare here these are championship winners or people whove made the finals and steves attitude lets him count

HeatManZE.....::i believe univeristy of indiana can beat the lakers at this point  -john calipari
junoNCAL::when you look at it, kobe is just a glorified monta ellis  call me crazy, but when you look at it, he's just a little bigger and played with much more talent.
brandon132::Kobe played great defense in his prime, better scorer than Monta, he is 34 and STILL is one of the best scorers in the league...  I agree he shoots more than he should but never disrespect the black mamba by comparing his overall game to Monta Ellis..
KobeBrickFuhrerBryant211::Agreed.
DR HORSE::2012-2013 lakers" the greatest show on higtops"
pdxrovermech::has DHo always been listed at 6-11? i thought he was 7-0 or 7-1.
pdxrovermech::i guess i never noticed, but seeing him stand next to aldridge and hickson i was thinking there was no way he was 7 ft.
elibird4321::They may list him at 6'11", but he is more like 6'10"
x_chip_douglas_x::lakers would 2-0 if they cut down the turnovers in the 2nd game and hit their fts in the 1st game. everyone needs to chill
brandon132::easily correctible.  Their defense is still terrible though
x_chip_douglas_x::ft shooting and TO's are correctable
They Call Me Smiley13::Lol IF IF IF!!! Any team could be 2-0 IF they did this or that.
They Call Me Smiley13::Exactly.
