tdyshadow::Did Pekovic get injured? According to my fantasy he only played 14 min.
MinniWolves90::Blowout city.
orange-bruins-suns-jaguars-mariners::i'm really hoping we get a solid lottery spot and get this ben mclemore kid from kansas.  that dude can ball.  we need a scorer like that.  granted he didn't play well today, but he has massive potential.  definitely don't want otto porter jr anymore after today's bust.
freaky69az::Suns'll probably draft someone like Shabazz Muhammad  Sarver must go!!
crooked ernie::nice win wolves, good shooting and good d!  i thought they were tanking the season but they might of decided to man up against some old teammates in beasley and wes johnson,  can't believe that guy is starting again.

wunderrr::Gophers!
arizonasting13::Hell yeah! Great win for us tonight
Senator Cosgrove::WOW, Suns dont even have pride...If you are going to tank, do it with dignity, dont embarrass the franchise and its supporters.....  Great culture Hunter is building here lol
arizonasting13::lets be real here.... no Gortat, Dudley or O'neal and even with those three they suck. What did you expect?
playmakerzam::good job suns!
FORKWDEVIL::This is beautiful
dlhouse18::LAST POST!!!!!
arizonasting13::nope
PoppaVenk::what happened to Pekovic?
DrakoFan1::Foul trouble is all. Still scored ok and rebounded
dlhouse18::He's oft-injured. Thinking PF Williams C Love would be better than PF Love C Pek at this point. For three reasons. A: D-Will always plays B: That would give the team crazy range C: It's would be a lot cheaper
Minnysota Vikings::Wow the Wolves are taking the Suns out behind the woodshed
DrakoFan1::They are in the same boat as the wolves as far as injures go
SmellyIndianMod::are you surprised ? suns are the worst team in the league
dlhouse18::You beat us last time. Could have fooled me.
Bandwagon_Bobcats.Fan::Is anyone even in attendance at this point
danielsdbacks3::Thank you for beating the suns
frnorth::NP the Wolves have had their share of hoping for losses for draft position. As far as I'm concerned, we (Wolves fans and the team itself) need to quit looking for the "rookie savior" and start looking for veterans who fill the holes we still have (SG!!!!!!!) and go after one of the better free agents next year (OJ Mayo, JJ Redick).  They have enough young players it's time to move forward with some guys who have been in the league and know how it works.
Tyler BarnesMNSports::I haven't watched a second of this game. Who's with me?
danielsdbacks3::Hi
Sir Mittens the ninth:::) Wolves 2014 NBA champs
Minnysota Vikings::Put Chris Johnson in! Is a 28 point lead not enough?
Sir Mittens the ninth::T-Wolves going undefeated starting today.
iamjomama39::nice move firing the coach Starver its bvious it wasn't him more like the sheety players on ur fooking team
SmellyIndianMod::battle of the most pathetic team in the NBA?
SmellyIndianMod::definitely battle of the dumbest
Sir Mittens the ninth::surprisingly no, there are worse NBA teams out there then these two.
WatergateSwag III::well this isn't the lakers board
WatergateSwag III::Look at all those championship teams Miami faced during their streak! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_Miami_Heat_season  dey r da gretest!
23germany::wait for cha on a btb in mia on sunday  133-48
Asknicks7::How would you rank the timberwolves guards?
Sir Mittens the ninth::meow
Minnysota Vikings::Chase Budinger is showing his worth to this team. #WelcomeBackBro
Sir Mittens the ninth::Wolves should try to find a way to sign him long term this off season if the money is right.
Sir Mittens the ninth::maybe?????  He does have a needed shooting ability that the Wolves lack.
Minnysota Vikings::Do you think he has the potential to become our future starting SF? AK probably won't be around after next season.
Eddierocs::Tatas or @$@%
Eddierocs::Tatas or @ss
trash.can::im man hoe
Tyler BarnesMNSports::WOW
KittyNationPride::The gophers board it out of control lol
Gregor_Monson731591::Get your draft on: http://tinyurl.com/challenge-free-nba1

PoRtEr_24::Very quiet board tonight....wonder why lol
Tyler BarnesMNSports::are you serious? lol
skywaalk3r::at least we can actually read the posts over here haha
Cmoney6824::Minnesota  rocks...put $5000  on  wolves  money  line
Cmoney6824::thanks  bro....
phxstar20::Ur crazy. I likes it goodluck
Cmoney6824::was  gonna  put $20,000  but  got a  lil  nervous..... should  have  bet  the  house
C.s.1174::I make sure everyone has a box of tissues beside them every time PHX plays, especially when they lose or get blown out by the visiting teams. Sad. My high school basketball program was more interesting to watch!
Sonny D. Light::This is what happens when those darn cats get into your speed stash.
Reverend Father Uncle Ruckus::This 2012-2013 Minnesota Timberwolves team is the greatest NBA team ever assembled...  Andrei Kirilenko, Nikola Pekovic, Kevin Love, Luke Ridnour, JJ Barea, Ricky Rubio, Alexey Shved, Chase Budinger, and Greg Stiemsma.  What a team.
jtkleinman03::haha
Kev_010::please wolves don't draft shabazz!!
Minnysota Vikings::omg just throw the white flag in Suns
spennyjj3::Im so glad we got rid of Beasley
C.s.1174::Suns are pathetic! not even worthy of watching on TV. I can't believe they're even considered a professional basketball team!
goodfellanate::uh why are there people watching NBA right now?
WatergateSwag III::there*  you editing bas.t.a.rd
WatergateSwag III::no
goodfellanate::yeah I know fixed it. happy?
Minnysota Vikings::Wes Johnson = <b> BEAST</b>
WatergateSwag III::They were hyping Dragic up to become the white CP3. lmfao
spennyjj3::Try Ricky Rubio
WatergateSwag III::true, rubio is also no where near cp3's level and probably wont even get there
spennyjj3::Chase Budinger can ball
Skylander14::A lose for the Wolves would be huge here, but the Wolves are disappointing me.
Orange6O2::All around awesome game being played by the Suns so far.
RetroSneeks::D a m n suns suck black c o c k..... F u c k
Minnysota Vikings::Budinger's shooting &lt;3
Get your foot off the boat::31 in the first....likely end up with 78.
