ZachC1965::Klay Thompson &gt; Kobe Bryant
Man From UNC::When is Kyrie Irving ever going to play some defense. Nate Robinson went right around him twice in the last two minutes of the game when the Cavs still had a chance to win the game....have to get Irving off the floor at crunch time.....he is a scorer only point guard.....
jayroberts59::it's called big man and there suppose to block the shot at the rim. Every guard can get to the rim but you have to help out to stop it.
goosu123::Always look to someone from UNC for an unbiased opinion on a Duke guard. Now please shut the $@%! up.
speckd02::Monta Ellis is a P.U.S.S.Y.  i played 3 rec league games in one night with a separated shoulder that happened in the first game...  it popped back in and i was good to go.  i know cool story bro...
ZachC1965::Heaving bricks all night could make anyone pop a shoulder...  I'm talking about speck, not Monta...
echoxray::Wow. We really believe you because we all know you.
NBA_refs_are_weak::big surprise, klay thompson is a beast. can golden state draft guards or what?
warrior08jr::my parlay was houston -7, michigan 1, colorado st -7, and $@%!$ cavs -2
Sep Seven::KLAY THOMPSON
Sep Seven::False
birdman._.::zugs dick
Bro-kowski::Shot to the nose! Take that, you sexual harasser.
RayKrebbs1978::Tough night for the Cavaliers.  When you turn the ball over that many times you usually lose.  Check this out - http://www.lakecounty-sentinel.com/index.php?p=51_14
Man From UNC::No defense from Kyrie in the last two minutes...what's new....
PortlandBlazers1004::Are people really calling Irving the 'Natural'
Man From UNC::Irving naturally don't play no defense.....
lehmanator123::there is only 1 natural and it's Roy Hobbs
DoubleV1369::they said "The Natural" not "Glass Knee Brandon"
amyredden1::HEY WHERE SHOULD I COMMIT, UNC OR OHIO STATE???  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfVxUn1qC9k
mightywiichampion::Wow good job......
averymicheal0923::Hope you crappy Cleveland fans support the Cavs, as they play their fannies off every game for you losers.You guys make me sick. You don't deserve this team. But you actually deserve the Browns.
KingGeorge53::We Cavalier fans adore the loser Heat fans.   Not 8, not 7, not 6, not 5, not 4, not 3, not 2, not 1.... awwwwwwwww   poor itty bitty sore loser Heat fans still upset the last time the Cavs played the Heat we creamed your team and you can't get over the hump to win a ring.
DoubleV1369::Heat at least made the finals..... not that i care, im a Warriors fan haha
kingdman2011::did you have a psycho ex girlfriend from cleveland averymicheal0923
mags2282::What are you talking about?
cphtcpht::gay
KingGeorge53::Congrats to the Warriors and their fans.   Go Cavaliers!  Never thought I'd be writing this, but way too much Love tonight.
WarriorsGO::I think Caspi is hurting your team. His stats dont look to bad this game, but he looks lost out there. Just my opinion.
rockndoc3::Ouch.  Just got back from the game.  That was ugly.   Everyone turned the ball over.   Everyone looked a half step slow on D.  Everyone took their turn putting up bad shots.  On the bright side, they rebounded well, otherwise this would have been a blowout, and Semih Erden showed that he has the chance to be a regular contributor in the NBA.  If the Cavs can find a stud center to start in the future, their front line could be good.
fatemusthide::Oh well, I guess "it is what it is". The guys are tired and it showed, how many shots went off the front of the rim? Tough game to watch. Seems like TT and Gee have looked a little complacent as of late, hope that's not a trend.   Semih looked tough, I could do without the volleyball crap under the rim though, at least Big Z could tip those in on a regular basis lol.
spong3bobrox::Dear Cavs Fans,       I am gonna stop watching Cavs games. Everytime I watch we lose. and everytime I dont watch we win win. I hate to do this but I gotta take one for the team. GO CAVS!!!!!
KingGeorge53::I don't think we need to worry about the lottery.   We have a long line of good teams coming up finally.   This'll put us back down on the pecking order.
1mproperDancing::Agreed.  Everyone is acting like this team is a bunch of world-beaters because they've stomped teams like Charlotte, Detroit, and Minny.  Guess what...those teams all suck.  It's nice to see us doing work against the other bottom-feeders, but we've only played a handful of teams over .500 and we've lost to all of them.    The Cavs are fixing to come back down to earth after a hot start in the next month.  But as a Cavs fan, that's a good thing.  The team looks competitive most nights, they're playing hard, and we've got several talented young players who (Irving in particular) will be obvious building blocks for this team going forward.    Still, we need those losses to translate into another high lottery pick.  Irving needs at least one more guy who can drop twenty or more a night next to him.
godson0214::i say were winning too much anyway lol just keep tuning in and we may end up with a top 5 lottery pick
spong3bobrox::i'll just be checking the scores. I will, however, be watching the Cavs-Heat game, I dont care what anybody say!
fatemusthide::Bro! If there's one game we need you to miss, it's that one! lol
godson0214::please take 1 for the team and resist watching them lol jp stop missing our good games
spong3bobrox::I dont know why yall are talking about what the fans are gonna say when Bron comes to town, the Heat are home for the first two matchups

Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::I went on the Heat board and wrote "Go Heat!" yet even with my username got no response or likes. :(
Fullserenity::Home from the Q.  I don't even know where to start.  Cavs looked tired, but that is no excuse for that play.  Too many turnovers, terrible pick n' roll defense.  Kyrie is playing well, but like I said the other day, he has to cut down on the careless turnovers, where he isn't even trying to make a play.  The carry violations, just too many.  Don't like Sessions running the point when he and Kyrie are in the game together, the ball does not move as well as when Kyrie is in running the show.  Cavs are really thin in the back court with and w/o Parker.  No one but Kyrie, Ramon and Gibson now.  They need to swap out some of these forwards and call up a guard.  Semih looked good, played with energy, that was about the only good thing I can say about the game from a Cavs perspective.    And Lee is a beast.  As badly as the Cavs played they still would have won if not for him playing lights out in the 4th.
1mproperDancing::Whole-heartedly agree with Sessions not running the point when they're both on the floor together.  That frustrates the hell out of me every time I watch it.  I was at the Charlotte game the other night and was complaining about that throughout the game.  Kyrie is your starting point guard and obviously has the better court vision of the two.  No reason Sessions should be running the ball up the floor, and there should never be any non-fast break possessions where Kyrie doesn't touch the ball if he's on the floor.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::(In my cheesy DJ voice) This one goes out to all those LeBron lovers who think Cleveland hasn't gotten over his leaving them... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLpfbcXTeo8&amp;ob=av2e
AdamWest234::Every time Bron Bron touches the ball the crowd should chant "Delonte".    Any takers?
1mproperDancing::The Delonte and Rashard choices are dumb.  It has pretty much become common knowledge that both of those rumor are complete and utter crap, and were in fact slipped out by Maverick Carter when LeBron was choking in order to try to shift the blame to something other than LeBron's inability to function in the clutch.  Just read The $@%!$ of Akron for the full details of both rumors.
I know more than you boy::Or Rashard. Mix em together?
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Can we borrow "Who's Your Daddy?" from Boston?
jfuriate::Le Bron is Wade's B.I.T.C.H. Boy.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Holy sh*t TT's shirt in this interview is freaking me out.
TheKushJedi::does anyone know why wright only played 23 minutes?
gsraider::Well dorrel has stepped it up the past few games I think it was just a bad day for dorrel like he had the first nine games
TheKushJedi::do you think that will be temporary or permanent?
gsraider::Dorrel was missing shots while Klay was on fire from 3
jfuriate::Byron got out coached tonight. He should have used all of his bench!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Seriously, I'm looking forward to the Cavs-Heat game like...
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Okay. I don't. I've moved on. Most of us have. It's just that no one else seems to recognize it.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::When Lebron comes Cavs fans should just chant "F*ck you" one time when he is announced. Simple yet packs a punch.
AdamWest234::I thought cleveland people didn't care about Lebron anymore
1mproperDancing::We care about him losing.  If he never wins a title, that's going to go down as a win for Cleveland fans.  We've moved on, yes, but that doesn't mean we still can't hate and jeer him every chance we get.
I know more than you boy::We don't. Just when he comes into town we gotta do something. It's not like we're talking about him everyday, which is what everyone thinks for some reason. Don't see the problem in not liking an athlete. Everyone has an athlete they don't like. Mine are LBJ and Ball So Hard T-Sizzle.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Im just having fun bro. Dont care that much but dont get me wrong when he comes back to town i want him to be verbally abused.
I know more than you boy::I'd just do that the whole game.  It's the best way to get a message across.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Genius. I will be right there with you.
I know more than you boy::I'd make that a drinking game. Everytime the crowd says f you take a sip.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Say one "F*ck you" every time he touches the ball.
AdamWest234::Kyrie Irving = John Wall.   BUSTER.
1mproperDancing::Technically so far this year Irving has been a bit better than Wall.  He'll never be a better athlete, but there's no reason he can't be a better overall player.
I know more than you boy::Irving shoots better and turns the ball over less is a little bit worse of a passer, and is just as good, if not better on D. And he's younger. Total bust right?
brandomymando::oh adam...when will you learn? dont you know you're embarassing your mother being the only 17yr old in the 6th grade
brandomymando::i'm sorry, but there won't be a next time. the police found the tapes of the little kids in your closet.... good luck on the inside buddy. dont drop the soap.
brandomymando::no thanks, but thanks for offering
AdamWest234::No.  Maybe you should brando my mando instead.
brandomymando::so you got my thank you card and chocolates in the mail?
AdamWest234::Nah they thought it was gay.  But you obviously liked it.
brandomymando::mustve made mom and dad so proud
AdamWest234::Wrote the script bro.
I know more than you boy::The question now is how do you know that's a gay p o r n o...
brandomymando::lmao how did you know that? searching through your dads closet again?
AdamWest234::Coming from the dude named after a gay p o r n o.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Feb. 4 Dallas comes to town. What kind of reception will they get?
I know more than you boy::Standing O and we raise a banner in honor of them.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Probably more cheers than the Cavs get.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::Bottom line Cavs fans need to be more creative. I want to here things other than boos when LeBron comes to town.
1mproperDancing::We chanted "a**hole" the first time he was in town.  The second time I think the crowd was so overwhelmed at how well the Cavs were playing that they just forgot to do anything other than boo.
jfuriate::Le Bron.  Who's your daddy?
I know more than you boy::Classic F U would be nice too.
brandomymando::Lebron! You Have AIDS!!! always seems to get a reaction
kfultz42::i thought they said a bunch of messed up (but awesome) stuff first time he came to cleveland
I know more than you boy::"DWADES BUTT BUDDY". &lt;--- It's a start
kingdman2011::can you believe the cavs are still the 7 seed with a 1.5 game lead on boston even after this loss
KyrieBro::That dont really have anything to do with all of this
KyrieBro::My favorite nba team is the mavs! go dirk!
KyrieBro::Anyone here a huge duke fan?
SomeGuySays::Have been for 35 years.
taa2008::Have to root for the fellow Blue Devil now representing my hometown team.
AdamWest234::Well I am American so I guess I am forced to be a huge duke fan.
ayoitsjk021::Yes, Irving is looking solid. Rookie of the year no doubt
kfultz42::ohio state baby
Dworm84::Here!!!
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Not a college game guy, but nothing against those who are.
I know more than you boy::Hope not ..
KyrieBro::Yes \
KyrieBro::Kyrie was beast on there team!
AdamWest234::America's team?
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::9 games in 15 days. Home-away on consecustive nights, followed by away-home on consecutive nights with all road games in between. Last year, this would've been a massive losing streak. Now, a day off before Chicago. Egad. Next year's going to look easy compared to this.
Giggityiggity::I think Andris Biedrins is a very, very, very underrated player and was the MVP of the game.  Ya, David Lee was boss, but Biedrins has cut down on his foul trouble and has become a premier defender, IMO.
WarriorsGO::only 1 game. I agree he was good this game.
I know more than you boy::His free throw shot counters out any good game he has had or will have.
Giggityiggity::+18 in plus or minus.  Pretty beast.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::If i had one wish it would be that when Lebron comes to the Q every time he touches the ball everyone goes silent then starts cheering again when he passes. If it could ever happen Lebron couldnt handle it. Too bad you can never organize something like that with so many people.
kfultz42::yeah we should say his name wrong when we introduce their starters instead
kfultz42::SF for the Miami Heat #6 Akron Hates You
AdamWest234::Start a facebook group. I want to join.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::Media can. Get the media to do it and it'll happen if it picks up.
I know more than you boy::Dude. Do you know how many times that'd happen in the 4th quarter? It'd tire out the crowd.
Believeland_Tribe_Cavs_Browns::It would go down in history. NBA fans never do anything like college fans do.
Hello Kyrie Irving::Semih Erden and Jamison were the only BOSS 2nite, very dissapointed with the turnovers smh
thectownbrown16::Semih Erden had a crap load of garbage points and only 3 reb. i would rather take the double double from andy
naterobinson1011::Nate Robinson 6th man of the year.
naterobinson1011::probably right nate is my fav player so u all was have to have faith.
kfultz42::james harden
thectownbrown16::hahaha RIIIIGHT
Hello Kyrie Irving::Ramon Sessions should really get traded, he's not doing any good for the team.
I know more than you boy::He's a great backup PG.
thectownbrown16::kyrie was boss tonight for the cavs... david lee was a beast tho... GO CAVS BABY.. LOVE YOU!
AdamWest234::I love you too.
Giggityiggity::Just my thoughts but.. Sessions should not be playing with Irving at the same time.  Not sure who they'll play otherwise but Kyrie does not seem to play without the ball well unless he's setting up the play early.  Also, we'll continue to get harassed by opposing big men if we can't help AND close out.  TT needs to work on his offensive moves and get more fluid.  Lastly, Kyrie needs to take better care of the ball.  I don't mind him taking shots down the stretch but he needs to not force things so much at times.
TheFutureGhostofJoeTait::I'd rather see him try to force things. Plays don't make themselves. You have to be aggressive at times. Irving's got to go through the process of those nuances.
T.O.G.M.S.17::i agree with evrythin 110%
Hans Duo::Going to the Cavs Bulls game Friday down at the Q. Drive safe tomm bros. Snow in the forecast tonight
Hello Kyrie Irving::ok that was HORRIBLE. cavs gonna get the butts whooped by the Bulls
thectownbrown16::just shut up dude lol
kfultz42::yeah but 7 away games in a row prob hurt a little bit
bjonthe492nd::tough loss but they look so tired. AP was missed and the sessions irving backcourt thing didn't work. They'll be better Friday! Can't wait for that game! i hope derrick rose plays.
NewYorkMetsMan::Big OKC fan here, but had the pleasure of catching this one on League Pass. Both teams are for sure heading in the right direction, and have some good fans behind them. Good luck to both teams the rest of the way.
Giggityiggity::Very, very true.  Good luck to OKC!
bjonthe492nd::thanks man
I know more than you boy::Rookies looked good tonight and that's all I want from this season. Improvement from the rookies. Winning will come, but I'd much rather fill up our hole in the wing in the next draft then win this year and become a middle of the road NBA team.
49GiaWars::GOOD GAME CAVALIER FANS YOU GUYS ARE REAL FANS !!!
yata9arasu::Thank you very much!  :)
Hans Duo::We know, thanks
mikeyp2307::David Lee is a killer. Dude couldnt miss.
