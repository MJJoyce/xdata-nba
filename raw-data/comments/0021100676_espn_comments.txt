nblucas97::I still think Hansbrough got so mad because Martin nearly goosed him up his $@% hole. He wasn't pissed until that happened.
aerojovi83::Just like in college, Blake is slightly (only very slightly) better than Psycho T, but Psycho T's team OWNS Blake's team.
Plargo::Griffin this season: 53.5% FG 54.4% FT Almost shooting better from the floor than the free throw line. Embarrassing and/or pathetic.
Plargo::Any FT % under 75 is a disgrace for any player in the NBA.
pioms::Yeah, he's a big. Don't know too many strong  bigs that own the paint and shoot well from the freethrow line.
crazyjapo::Clippers are pure crap. They're not going to make the playoffs. Paul is an overrated little fat dude with the athleticism of a UPS driver. 2 fans like this.
Jumpman1396::you must be trolling lol not going to make the playoffs, check they're record
crazyjapo::wheres all the idiot clipper fans now?they were saying how L.A. was a clipper town now.hahaha looks like that lttle midget chris paul let you guys down.
ACandOJ::Lob City....Born 2011 -  Died 2012
Cheesehead_29::C.Butler has no room to mock anyone! Griffin and Hansbrough was battling it out, things got intense, it happens! No sense if making more of it than what it really was. This wouldn't have even been an issue if C.Butler wouldn't have acted like a fool! I guess he has to do something though to keep in the spotlight, he hasn't really been relevant in the NBA now has he?
CowboysGot5Rings::So much for the dream team!
BSP343::Wow I didnt realize how good of a bench Indiana has. Hansborough, George Hill and Barbosa ain't bad.
BullsontheRise::Hansbrough is a hack. Too bad Griffin didn't kick his a$$.
ToneZone3::butler isn't even near as good as tyler so idk why he was mocking him. Most likely only because he is white, and he was dominating them
scottiowa30::y b/c Griffin got fouled hard?? No way, Griffin better expect that once and a while b/c he takes it to the hoop every flippen time he touches the ball. + Butler mocking Hansborough was a joke - the amount of adversity Tyler has had to deal with in the NBA is off the charts. + Hanborough's mock of Bulter would have been great - it would have involved one finger pointing to the score board.
scottiowa30::.
jonnyd_94::Butler should roll his camera during practice so they can figure out why they are struggling
workman47::World B. Free &gt; Chris Paul
Detrocity::I was so bummed when the Pistons traded Billups ... I was so bummed when Billups got hurt as a Clipper ... has had the same effect.
Mr.october187::Get ready to get more bummed out because the clippers are not getting past the second round might not even the first.
Hugh9849317::Nobody wants to talk about the ELEPHANT in the room, but  until Blake Griffin starts hitting more than 55% of his FREE throws-Clippers will continue to be inconsistent. His horrible free throw shooting has cost team five games EASY.  Get the guy some help !!!!!!!
Mr.october187::The clippers problem is they dont stick any defense.
water12345::A.  The pacers are so much better when they go 10 deep.  Hope Vogel finally realizes that.  Shortening the rotation is a bad idea for this team. B.  The Clippers (Paul, Griffin, Kmart, mo etc.)  Jeesh thats a lot of talent.   If they ever decide to play via sharing the ball, watch out....too much one one one crap....as a pacer fan, i know suffering, so i'd like to see them be the better LA team. C. Reggie Evans is just a terrible basketball player....all he does is shove people, foul people.....just shouldn't ever see the court. D.  The Barbosa addition...nice!
BullsontheRise::So Reggie Evans = Tyler Hansbrough then, huh.
nblucas97::Hansbrough has so much more offensive game then Evans. Not even a comparison.
ToneZone3::you mean noah?
Mr.october187::The pacers are getting ready for there big brother in the playoffs which is the Chicago bulls awe how cute .
darwinislord::I predict Clips lose in the first round of the playoffs and then slither back into obscurity. Clipper Darrell paints his house pink, Blake Griffin's agent hypnotizes Donald Sterling and orchestrates a trade, and Chris Paul decides to play baseball.
yorkkallday::nba player fantasy draft lebron goes #1 dwade not in #12 see whole thing here http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/
choate_sedition::VInny is simply the worse coach in the league
Goon-::Clippers are pure crap. They're not going to make the playoffs. Paul is an overrated little fat dude with the athleticism of a UPS driver.
clippernation04::ur a true moron
zachrlee::Barbosa's making an impact right away. It would've been interesting had he played against the Knicks.
pacerpride35::Still trying to figure out why Barbosa didn't play in either of the games against NY. Nice addition for us.
dom3983::Del Negro will get fired. he was a bad hire. there was a reason he was always on the hot seat in Chicago.
hornyleo22::why couldn't the clips trade del negro for mcmillian??!?!?!?!?!?
diditravel::START RAMON!! HE NEEDs SUPPORT!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGpJ4zF_ypE
ChiGuy1002::Guys. We need to play better. We gotta execute and try to score more points than the opposition.  Side note: how's my hair looking?  - Vinny
drac1100::Taking a little longer than normal, but the Clippers are returning to the form they have maintained for 30 years.
Raptorsfan080::Indianas lucky to have Barbosa, man I miss. goodluck
BlacknSilverNationRidesAgain::Put Clipper Darrell In...... Best Player on that Squad
Ultras South::Pacers = Underachievers
kenbomc::I still cannot believe Griffin was an all-star.
ToneZone3::and a starter
scottiowa30::His invite was paid for by Kia (official car of the NBA).
eddiegunns::What is the Clippers record after Chauncey went down? I'm telling you, fire Del Negro now and get someone who knows how to create a solid unit . Nick young is a joke too. This team is starting to look like a first round out
jank6708::they don't even look like a playoff team Fake Griffin is a joke he can't make free-throws
Zippppppp::didn't see the game did he air ball any tonight??
mhsmustang1::laker boards, 5000+ comments.   clipper boards, 742
Zippppppp::The bandwagoners realized who the better team was
mhsmustang1::point being ppl stay hating on the lakers just to do it, but when the clippers get their sh*t split nobody seems to care! lol
watchDreplay::both teams are overrated.
JayTwizzie::Your point?
GiantsFanForever2011::Fact: Lakers are still better than Clippers. Clippers trolls
Strong Troll Forventhrund::Wow! Fuccin Scissors cant close games smh! Chris paul laying fuccin bricks smh! Get the $@%! off the court you damn scrub! $@%!!
BigDtown09::Clippers have too many random pieces that don't really fit. They don't mesh well together and they haven't since Chauncey went down.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::they are the eagles of basketball
JayTwizzie::No... they dont mesh with the Coach.. our coach is holding us back, you can see half the time when he talks they really dont listen!!
BigDtown09::I think Del Negro is totally inept too, but they were playing much better when Chauncey was there. His injury was when things started to go downhill.
Lin_Diesel_17::Clippers are horrible. How do you lose with so much talent.. makes no sense. Looks like its all Lakeshow in LA still.
IndianaFan3130::Really happy to see Pacers play tougher than the Clips - Psycho T/Blake battling down in post was great basketball. Big win for Pacers.
PartyLikeACaveman::Fire VDN worst coach in the league
JayTwizzie::I've been saying that since We hired him!!
JayTwizzie::Now its Paul do something.. and kick the ball to blake every now and then!!!
AdamSaidThis::Bulls knew that. He ran one play...it was called "Rose...do something"
AdamSaidThis::what's the record since chauncey went down? 10-14?
water12345::chauncey is one of those impact players on a team...makes everyone around him better....big loss...  The pacers were on a roll to George Hill went down with the ankle injury....he makes other players better too
AdamSaidThis::they would've had the cap room next summer when a certain center would be back on the market...Chauncey made like 18 mill this year. Cut that down to 3 mill/yr. for a short contract? There is 15 million freed.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::chauncey is underrated. sucks that he has to get hurt
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i don't think they released him for anyone. that's the bad thing. maybe to create room for tyson chandler? i can't really remember  EDIT:what guy above me said lol it popped up as soon as i hit post
AdamSaidThis::to make room for chandler i suppose. but they of course overpaid...chauncey only had this year left i believe. making a vet play out the contract and then negotiating would've paid bigger returns than chandler imo.
adavisrc09::Who'd they release him for?
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::haha heck ya. he was the best part of the team. he was putting up unbelievable numbers
AdamSaidThis::Under rated everywhere he goes too. Knicks getting rid of him was a "whaaaaaa????" moment for me.
A-Dude-Playing-A dude-Disguised_as-another-Dude::"ZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz"
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i hate this facebook and twitter junk they added....
ChiBulls1224::so do i its annoying
adavisrc09::ESPN should've added a block button with all this new stuff as well
ChiBulls1224::this board is nice and quiet
ChiBulls1224::spammers go everywhere
adavisrc09::W8 till the Pacers get out of the 1st round.... spammers will head here as well
adavisrc09::The only players I'm a fan of on the pacers are Paul George and Barbosa
ChiBulls1224::pacers always play the bulls tough  they will be  a hardout for anyone in the playoffs
ChiBulls1224::lebron james is dead: sources say he choked to death
A-Dude-Playing-A dude-Disguised_as-another-Dude::Here is a joke Clippers!!!!
JayTwizzie::So you're lakers lost too !
ChiBulls1224::granger talks so much trash, and he can't back it up  he is vastly overrated; he cant pass or play d  hes a streaky shooter who got hot one year and made an all star team
ChiBulls1224::my concern with him is just the scoring  dont get me wrong i respect the guys i do not like how he carries himself nor why he talks trash  he has nothing on drose and the bulls
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::who has anything on the bulls besides the heat? i still think bulls are better than them too. i dont like granger either to be honest, i was hoping for a trade before his stock goes even lower.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::he can play d, but he can't score consistently. doesn't deserve all that money
mchomburg::What a terrible half for the thunder
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::good win pacers, can you guys actually win a few games in a row now?
ToneZone3::considering they have won 5 and 6 games in a row twice this year to match the losing streaks
adavisrc09::Their better at losing multiple games in a row, but i see where you going
PadresChargersClippers::How does someone end up liking the 49ers and pacers?
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::going to have to draft one i think. im afraid they will go after lamichael james in a later round
PadresChargersClippers::Mathews is really good but he cant seem to stay healthy. At least A.J has made a couple moves this year. I like the Royal addition.  Although now after losing Tolbert they need a backup.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::they are losing a lot of offensive weapons. tolbert and v jax. ouch. i think tolbert is better than matthews too...
PadresChargersClippers::Hopefully they dont suck this year!
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::lol i like the chargers too actually
PadresChargersClippers::My bad, there are a lot of SF niner "fans" that came about in Socal this past year.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i dont like the 49ers. being from southern cali i would think you know who the long beach state 49ers are
ChiBulls1224::lol pacers still suck
