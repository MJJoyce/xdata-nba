CarlosBoozeCruise::One of the most inconsistent teams in the NBA. One night they can be shorthanded and beat the Heat, the next night they can fall to the Bobcats.
MRcantholdmedown::21-17 at home isn't that bad, certainly not great, but not at all awful.  The Wiz are just a horrible road team.
EuropeDude1981::John wall playing his butt off even though the games don't matter anymore. Hallmark of a great player. Take note derrick rose; this is how you get back in shape after some time off
EuropeDude1981::the bulls sure could have used 5 extra points from him, but why play when you can't tomahawk it from either leg
Celtics own the heat.::JOHN WALL IS FILTHYYY
GrealityBites::DC's stated goal is 9th place, the best of the worst.  No playoffs, lower draft pick.  They should get a spanking for not tanking.
chiefillwhiniwept::Hopefully everybody knows what a jerk Hinrich is now. The funny thing is he is at his worst when he is playing for the Bulls, at home. He must be pandering to his audience.
MRcantholdmedown::"Now that the Wizards have beat both the Bulls AND the Miami Heat.....Washing is now the favorite to win the NBA title" -- Chris Broussard
cbone2316::you crazy
guidobri::Has anyone noticed that John Wall is averaging almost 26 points a game over the last 2 weeks? Anyone?! I had to look it up to realize that he is playing out of his mind right now. Too bad that Wizards stink.
jkub5::Bruh, John Wall can ball. Everyone knew that before he got drafted. He's gonna be a legit all-star in the future. He just needs to work on his outside jumper and 3pt game to be elite.
chiefillwhiniwept::He's actually making his teammates, and the whole team, better with his return. I wouldn't say they stink.
crazyrunner1215::The Bulls are just mediocre without Rose. They might be able to win a playoff round, but that's probably it for this team (even if Rose does come back).   What they should have done is sit Rose all year and tank the season for a lottery pick.
Human.Highlight.Real::I guess the Bulls didn't tackle well tonight.
Jackiemoonsexy::<b>Be careful the Bulls are beasts wearing a sheep's skin. Be very careful....... watch your back comes playoff</b>
MRcantholdmedown::"I know what to do with a sheep"  -- Farmer
marbleclr::This just in: the Bulls are... average.
01Bulls4life::You must be worried about them since you are here.  Also you must not watch basketball.  Chicago has no Rose, Noah, Bellineli, RIP.  Yet, they lose some games and win many.    Let me see how your Heat can do without your "star" players.. Oh that's right, they lost to the Knicks. Also, this "average" team is 2-1 against the Heat without their star player..
Julio3559::So where are the bull? After taking karate to a basketball game against Miami, they are coming down to who they really are, gangsters trying to play basketball
geeman217::*yawn* complaining about a tough foul is typical of  a fan who doesn't know sh.it about the game...  Heat lost, should've lost Sunday and got killed tonight by Melo.  Slink along fella.
Julio3559::What is great with American sports is you can't win a championship playing tackle football on basketball game just to win on game like bulls vs heat. With or without d rose, bulls will never win the nba until Miami, okc, spurs, Denver, Indiana and maybe clippers are totally broken. Instead of praising luo deng who had a fantastic game against heat, who the hell was praised? Taj $@%!$@% Gibson for tackling lebron.he was all over the air saying stupidities, approved by the Danny the other liar from Boston Ainge. So where
01Bulls4life::Dude, it's been over a week.  Get over it.  If tomorrow you still butt hurt I suggest getting some butt cream.
Jake-Macauley::Washington is the best team not making the playoffs.
noogie293::means if you get beat by a girl that don't make her a man, she's still a girl...you just need to look down and make sure you still have a pair...LOL
cbone2316::what the hell does that even mean
sivadbop::There needs to be a specific word for "complimenting a team that is otherwise bad, just because they beat your team."    It's the sports equivalent of saying "yeah, that little girl beat me up, but DAMN does she have a reach!  and such sharp fists!"
Real Deal Beal::without a doubt
mmosier10::Wow Bulls suck
Dufners Revenge::rumor is rose won't come back this year unless the rest of the team gets healthy prior
raider_tat_on_my_arm_version3::Nbrigged
Real Deal Beal::he took like 8 steps man
tphester::Remember when Derrick Rose used to take a big dump on John Wall and every other elite PG?  What a sad story this is becoming.  It's time for him to come back.
tphester::sigh. It's like communicating with a brick wall.
skitah13@aol.com::I am a fan of all sports.  No Labron, Rodgers, Brady, Jeeter, yes I would miss them.  I also miss food on the table and fuel in the car and cash in the bank.  My priorities are solid, sports are entertainment. On another note, congratulations Shaq for you number being retired tonight.
skitah13@aol.com::What is so sad about this?
tphester::Good point--if you're not a fan of the Bulls I guess it can't be sad.  Rose was just on a completely different level than every other PG.
PK009::The wizards have the 4th best record in the east since John wall came back from from injury
skitah13@aol.com::Heat, Pacers, Nicks.   No Chicago here.
Driving67::Who is crying now... foul... Hinrich was gone after teammate Nazr Mohammed was called for basket interference while tipping in a rebound, but the tantrum had nothing to do with the goaltending call.  "When I was complaining about a non-foul call, I got one," Hinrich said. "And then the second one was very quick afterward. ... In that situation, in the late game, you've just got to avoid that happening. I've got to bite my tongue and let it go."
skitah13@aol.com::That was not a basketball play  ~L. James
Driving67::We hit Lebron Harder than that...come on ref...really ref that wasn't a foul on me... Hinrich Goodnight hit the showers... Ref
skitah13@aol.com::No place in the game for subs crying and whining about so called missed foul calls.
geeman217::Crying?  The guy fessed up he should've kept quiet...  You gotta try harder dude
Driving67::I think the qoute says it all... I did not get the call I wanted..Don't have to try harder... or just watch the highlights...he was crying on the court or maybe a better word was whining on the court. Come on ref you missed the call...and then good night!! Sure he is fessing up.... he got kicked out!!
The.Trolling.Police::LOL the only time the Bulls get +5000 comments on their game is when they play the Heat. Nice.
Driving67::Did the Bulls Win?
geeman217::Heat still on that winning streak??
Driving67::Guess that means  no...LOL
skitah13@aol.com::Man you got me, was busy cleaning the AR15Bushmaster223-175.  Must have missed that game.  Guess the bulls lost 90-86
Knicks just hit another 3 and are up by 20::LOL  ....the only thing worth saying about this
skitah13@aol.com::is?
CBass1317::Wall is playing like a man possessed.  Goodness.
skitah13@aol.com::He is the manimal, off the chain good!
TheQuinto7::John Wall is starting to live up to that #1 draft pick
ovechkinsgoal::fact: wizards started 4-28  fact: wizards, when healthy, might be the 2nd best team in the east.
rfrenc::when all teams are healthy or when the wizards are healthy against ather teams hurting?  the bulls are missing 2 allstars right now
skitah13@aol.com::sorry you got pissed dude
skitah13@aol.com::It is the team of mules who drag you down a dirt road.
geeman217::Ok we're done...  Bye Bye
sworthin117::2nd in the east = 5th in the west
geeman217::skitah13@aol.com - geeman, your team sucks.  Lost to the Wiz by four chumpchild _____________ WHO's YOUR TEAM???
skitah13@aol.com::geeman, your team sucks.  Lost to the Wiz by four chumpchild
geeman217::feel better now?
geeman217::wadlez - do you? _________ I'm not in here TRYING to validate my team like Wiz fans...
ovechkinsgoal::much better when wall and nene (best center in the east) is healthy
wadlez::do you?
heatbandwagonsincefeb1::no wonder rose doesnt want to come back
geeman217::Melo drops-   FIDDY on the Heat and you're here trolling??  *priceless*
geeman217::skitah13@aol.com - Go on your obamaphone and tell somebody.  Child go away FIB, oh my words are hurtful. ________________ Obamaphone? Chitcago? FIB?  smdh
skitah13@aol.com::Go on your obamaphone and tell somebody.  Child go away FIB, oh my words are hurtful.
geeman217::skitah13@aol.com - Still awake in Chitcago?......*No Value* ________________ You've been looking for someone to play with all night...  Go away kid.  You're a little too lame for my tastes...
skitah13@aol.com::Still awake in Chitcago?......*No Value*
skitah13@aol.com::that is mean spirited ~Deric Rose
skitah13@aol.com::Must be past bedtime in the Central Time Zone.  Parents, do you know where your children are?
james08381::bulls be lucky if they win one game come playoffs time
skitah13@aol.com::very lucky
Phatepiclewts::Haha Wall ruins folks
skitah13@aol.com::CHI 40-33  WEEEEEEEE
kevin durant is a poor mans melo::Melo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kevin Durant   against the Heat
skitah13@aol.com::CHI 86 -WSH 90
geeman217::FIDDY for Melo!   Love it and I ain't a knick fan
Dnash1972::no chalmers either who was guarding him? Battier and Rashard lewis lol  yawn
Pharoah_Monch::Without Lebron and D-Wade I don't think anyone cares.
kevin durant is a poor mans melo:::)
geeman217::That'll shut-up heat fans for a few...
kevin durant is a poor mans melo::IGGY?
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Perfect Game Notice by YU Darvish.
liquidvizions707::the wizards should be in the playoffs over the bucks. true story. they just had a bad start. bucks are just awful period
Phatepiclewts::It's because they didn't have Wall. He's such a dominant player.
geeman217::That was then, this is now...
geeman217::liquidvizions707 - haha true. but just saying. wizards blew out the heat. least they'd win a couple games i bet. bucks gonna get swept. gonna be boring as it gets ___________________ If Ellis and Riddick are able to hit from outside, Heat will have to bring out Bron to cover either wing.  Bucks will make them work for those "W"s..
liquidvizions707::haha true. but just saying. wizards blew out the heat. least they'd win a couple games i bet. bucks gonna get swept. gonna be boring as it gets
geeman217::I guess KOKA Roach Heat fans are gonna be a little scarce  Melo bout to drop fiddy on them...
Tarheelsvictory::Bosh, with the wimpy layup!
geeman217::liquidvizions707 - dunno why any team would be ok without homecourt advantage. at least for 1st round have that. and not like the bulls are good on road. _____ You have no clue.  before all the injuries set-in the Bulls had the best Road record in the league.  Playing on the   ROAD is no biggie to them.
skitah13@aol.com::Bulls lose bulls lose bulls lose.....oh that was supposed to be the cubbies (very feminine)
liquidvizions707::that was then. this is now.
geeman217::And- the playoffs is 3-weeks away.  The Chances of getting players back healthy is most likely.  You have to look at the big picture fella
RedBirds1711::Anyone else see the video that was posted on TheChive today about the league and rigging games so that the lakers are sured into the playoffs?
liquidvizions707::no. and no one with any sense would believe it anyway. lakers will get smashed by dallas tonight. they done.
geeman217::People like you keep Bookies driving fancy cars...
RedBirds1711::It would be wise to watch it... It actually shows proof.
Wichita State Fan since watching Sportscenter Last night::The most telling thing here is the Wizards didnt even play well (shot a very low %) and still won. The Bulls are in deep trouble.
ron953::That had to do with Bulls defense and by the way the Bulls didn't have a good shooting night either especially since Deng had an off night and he's been scoring 29 in the past 3 games before this
geeman217::DUDE Bulls were missing 4 players  PLUS TAJ re-injured his leg and Kirk got tossed...  What game was you watching?
Tarheelsvictory::The Knicks will get destroyed in the playoffs, by the Heat. This game should not even be close and I don't mean by getting a big lead in the 4th.  They should have been up by 10+ the whole game.
ron953::Knicks beat the Heat by 20 twice this year and looks like they're gonna win tonight
ron953::UK_Basketball_for_Life752 - And? Can't pay attention to the regular season.  That's why they play the games anyone can win the championship and hopefully you know that
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::And? Can't pay attention to the regular season.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::No one is beating the heat thisyear.
geeman217::MELO KILLING the Heat   Le Goat  He might get "FIDDY"
Tarheelsvictory::Spike lee can eat a big one!
Sean9035::Could be cool if they can keep Wall and Beal together (and fit) for a couple of years
GeorgeTownDC29::Wall will get a max and they will be playing together for at least the next 4 years
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::oy
GeorgeTownDC29::yes
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Restricted?
GeorgeTownDC29::He still has 1 more year then he will be
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Is wall restricted?
cbone2316::im pretty sure they will
Neil826::bulls are just too inconsistent without rose.  they would mop the floor with teams like this winning by 20 plus.  without him you get games like this and the bobcats loss.  this is pathetic considering they beat the heat 2 times this year.
geeman217::No worries man!
cbone2316::greg whittington im shoutting you out make it to the nba and get your grades up
cbone2316::i wonder if greg whittington will make it to the nba i hope so i can have the privledge in saying i player against him
