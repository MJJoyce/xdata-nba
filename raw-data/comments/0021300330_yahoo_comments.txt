jason o::I said this at the start of this nice run we have been on, but I hope Brown has a feel for this rotation now. I think this team has some solid players. We just need to come out with the intensity that we come out with for home games.
Ritchie G::When are going to see the last of jameer nelson? He typifies the magic's mediocrity for the last decade. Save for that trip to the nba finals, but we really know it was alston who steered that team in the playoffs.
Pat Z::That sound you hear when the Cavaliers take the floor is the flopping sound made by Anthony Bennett, the #1 overall draft pick.
jason o::I would love to see waiters outplay oladipo in this game.
Scott::Where is our favorite Cavs/Anthony Bennett troll Lady Jean.
Commenter::C'mon Cavs....all I want for Christmas is a few road wins!
PKM::Oladipo makes Cleveland pay for passing him up
Lawrence::Gee shined once again.Why he starts or even plays is beyond logic.
- LJ::bennet beat oladipo... next bennet will beat mcw... anthony the beast bennet will beat carmelo anthony and anthony davis
bob Z::Magic settle for too many outside shots. They should work through Vucevic.. Once they do this there outside gae will work better.
