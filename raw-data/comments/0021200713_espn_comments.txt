ryanbard123::LaMarcus looks like he's in a contract year, only he's not.  Is it just me or has he just jumped onto the big-boy level this year?  Outside/Inside/Defense/Rebounding and most important... dude is TOUGH (cannot call this guy soft)... his toughness is unquestionable now.  Pretty amazing to see his growth.
jank6708::Season will be lost by the time K-Love is healthy.  play Pek,AK,Rubio,Shved,D-Will the rest of the season
luvnbayes::Two things are obvious.  The Wolves can't compete as long as they keep playing all the small guards.  I respect both Ridnour and Barea but only one should be in the rotation.  The team just gets overwhelmed athletically with both of them.  The second is even more obvious, Derrick Williams is a flop.  The next time I hear how athletic he is I will just scream.  He is slow as molasses and his instincts are bad.   He's a liability on defense and a non-thinker on offense.  He's good enough to be in the league but that's it.
gerald68831::Started using this betting system called SportsBettingStar a few months back.  In my first month of using this system I made almost 3K in profits.  If you like betting on sports, I highly recommend this system.
bradwinsall::wolves should just tank and try and get a top pick. whether we trade the pick or kahn inevitably picks the 4th string center from harvard we don't know. looks like ricky is getting slightly more on track. i'm done being optimistic with this team but I would like to see them at full strength for like a month to see what they could do. and by full strength i mean a 100% in shape and healthy love, rubio, ak, pek, bud, etc.
MinniWolves90::I'd say Ricky is fully on track
archangel91::meanwhile, the season just slips away. fire kahn and get someone in there who will do something. what are the f****king waiting for, the other teams to let them win.
Rockets_not_a_serious_contender::twolves suck cause of their injuries and im so sick of their injuries.. how does Love break his knuckles doing push ups.. adelman, you suck for tha tone
Rip City Forever::<a><b>I just discovered the blazers have won 19 out of their last 21 against minny...thats impressive no matter who it's against. Heck if it was against the bobcats I'd still be proud (not trying to offend minny fans)</b></a>
ryanbard123::I think Mike Barrett said it was 20 of 22 after last night's game... oh well, still a great day to be a Blazer.
Rip City Forever::We've also won 11 of the last 13 in Minnesota or something like that
danyoyoh::Nice to see Rubio get back on track. He should be getting double-digit assists every night.
NW-Prophet82::25-23 overall. 17-8 at home and 8-15 on the road now....ehhh, that's respectable for the Blazers so far. Not "elite" obviously, but you know, a pretty decent team. Not bad
ColeW1989::Blazers are the most entertaining team in the league, regardless of record. Every game comes down to the 4th quarter, its great!
RIP City Beav::25-23 overall with a bench loaded with talent that the D-League would probably look at and go "meh" is pretty damn good.  The downside is that the better we do, the more likely we lose our top draft pick, which is only ours if we are in the top 12 (I think) in the draft.  Really looking forward to this summer with all the cap space we will have.  Go after a few role player FAs and this could become a dangerous team.
ryanbard123::It would be nice to get a good pick from the draft... maybe we can nab something in a Hickson trade.  God I don't want him to go anywhere though!
brownbear541::way better than i think anyone but the players thought they'd do. so yeah, pretty impressive, still in line for the last playoff spot
LaurasFiance::Hey everyone, I know that most people are on here talking sports, but was wondering if any of you had 30 seconds to get on Facebook and like a picture for my cousin Melissa. She has a chance to win free braces if she gets the most "likes". It would really be great if you could "LIKE" her photo. Here is the URL. I promise it's not a VIRUS--just a regular Facebook picture that needs to be "LIKED". http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=433008746766277&amp;set=a.433008670099618.93317.353502451383574&amp;type=1&amp;theater
bills4XAFC::If only the wolves hit a 3 pointer....too bad it wasn't game 7 of the finals...would have served them right.
Dame Lillard::@ Clyde... Here you go:  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=b3hb8l4
Rip City Forever::<a><b>I want to see a windmill or a tomahawk dunk soon ;)</b></a>
49ersGoat::Am I the only one who expected Bane to come on to the field after yesterday's blackout?
RipChipCity::The city.  Is yours.
Nucky Pinkman::All that matters is our plan.
Minnysota Vikings::Rubio, Shved, Ridnour, and Barea might be the wimpiest backcourt of all time.
wunderrr::people saying KD needs to gain strength for years. players are what they are. Rubio can drive it to the basket with quickness not with strength. he is a great passing guard but should work on his shot, so he defenders arent expecting a pass on every posession
RIP City Beav::They are all decent, but, and I might be wrong, but I think Minny was referring to them all being "softer" players.  They all play a style where they aren't driving for contact or going up strong.  Rubio is a great passer and he can score, but he needs to gain some strength.
Rip City Forever::<a><b>They are all good players </b></a>
Skylander14::The Wolves need to play Rubio and Shved at the same time. Barea and Ridnour are horrendous defenders.
afronius7::No it's not bad. Too many injuries all around on the team.
Dame Lillard::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=bdcb23n  This is the only one that would work... :(  Just messing around. :-P
Tamatoa0963::How long till Derrick Wiliams stops being promising prospect?
Minnysota Vikings::March of last year
ErikAmundson1121::Trade deadline....we need to deal him asap
ryanbard123::What could you get for him though?  His trade value can't be that good... unless it's with the right kind of coach/leaders on the team... even then....
ErikAmundson1121::Whatever. GO WOLVES!!  Talented team with a lot of injuries!!  could win tomorrow with Duncan/Ginobili out!  HOWL!
Rip City Forever::Been there done that
RickyWolfioGOAT::Rubio and Love for Kaepernick.Make it happen Khan.
blazers_0531::DAMIAN LILLARD R.O.Y!
Vega_2012::Agree.
blazers_0531::LMA like a boss!!
Dame Lillard::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=akbp4ra  Just messing around... :-P
ClydeTheGlide_22::do one with the blazers
dlhouse18::Square deal
Minnysota Vikings::I find it hilarious how it has the Wolves win total stay the same after the trade lol
talkinwolves3325::good god...
Vega_2012::Do one with my Rockets please :)
bstanto_08::http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/conversation?gameId=400278433.....this one is better...this is a rip off for the clippers tho haha,....wolves would prob win it all with this trade
ErikAmundson1121::idiot
bstanto_08::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=awalrw7..sorry heres the link
.LEBRON OWNS ALL...::So how about LeBron James tonight?
Minnysota Vikings::Beating the Bobcats by 5 points at home. Mighty impressive.
.LEBRON OWNS ALL...::Don't hate :P
ErikAmundson1121::Stop posting trades that are trading All stars. Does not Happen!!!!
ErikAmundson1121::what?
ErikAmundson1121::Like trading blake griffin for k love?  Tell me when it has happened recently?
dlhouse18::Tomorrow
dlhouse18::What about the Iguodala/Bynum/Howard/Afflalo trade?
ErikAmundson1121::No all stars haha unless AI is...
Vega_2012::Yes it does.
dlhouse18::So my computer screen is finally fixed. Just glad that Geek Squad didn't delete any of my porn.
Minnysota Vikings::Wait, so you watching porn caused you to need your computer screen fixed?
Minnysota Vikings::I was attempting to make a joke, but apparently it was too subtle. Forget about it.
dlhouse18::No it cracked when it was in my backpack. The porn is a seperate issue completely.
Vega_2012::Wow, they were gonna charge me like $300 to fix my cpu. So then i just bought a Macbook so i wouldn't get viruses ever again
dlhouse18::I only had to pay $35. They didn't even charge me for the new screen and I was surprised as heck. The lady told me before they fixed it that the LCD sceen would probably cost over $200
Vega_2012::Geek Squad is expensive as hell
dlhouse18::Basketball teams from the 60s could shoot better from three than the Wolves.
bstanto_08::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=b7pj6cr
ErikAmundson1121::Would never happen...
bstanto_08::the key is we have griffin for the long term
Minnysota Vikings::and then have Billups and Grant Hill retire at the end of the season? lol
bstanto_08::we gain 4 wins with this trade...lets do it
Dame Lillard::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=a2mndt8  Just messing around... :-P
ErikAmundson1121::STOP
Vega_2012::The Second Coming of KG
Minnysota Vikings::I actually like it
wunderrr::me too
wunderrr::just realized wolves are worst 3pt shooting team in the league
wunderrr::ok if its some historical stuff im quite proud
dlhouse18::Not only the worst, but historically one of the worst.
ErikAmundson1121::3rd times a charm!!!!  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=betlvyx
ErikAmundson1121::Being healthy doesn't make some one reliable. JJ could break his wrist next game? Terrible point.
ErikAmundson1121::In case you didn't notice JJ isnt reliable turning the ball over and Adelmen wants nothing to do with DWILL
Vega_2012::Reliable as in healthy.
Minnysota Vikings::Magic wouldn't do that trade. Afflalo is more than solid.
dlhouse18::You're lucky you get 3 strikes. I was about to exile you without parole if you did it again.
Vega_2012::I dont think the wolves would give up their one relialbe PG and a good prospect in Williams
joah5454_3::Why do the Timberwolves have so many white players?
CoryJBogie::russians like cold weather
Minnysota Vikings::Playoffs. http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=a8gfedv
talkinwolves3325::Well we'd have to scrounge up a few guys from the D-League to fill out the roster, but I'd say we'd have an outside shot
Vega_2012::Holy shh.it
ErikAmundson1121::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine  Sorry re do!  Good trade.
ErikAmundson1121::I got it finally
Vega_2012::Nope
talkinwolves3325::Try again....
dlhouse18::What trade?
Robot Mojo::Wolves. Nice try. Wishing that KG would resign.
Vega_2012::Hey Minn. Fans!!!!  'http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=abwsdol  Yay or Nay?
Vega_2012::Who do you think the wolves would want from the Rockets??
talkinwolves3325::I like Asik
dlhouse18::Nay. I do like Greg Smith however.
ErikAmundson1121::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine Get at me Kahn
ErikAmundson1121::I fixed it check it
dlhouse18::I'm sure that's all Kahn does in his office. Play with trade machine.
Vega_2012::I also committed this same mistake :(
Minnysota Vikings::you forgot to save the trade
Robot Mojo::Funny how Wolves turned on Nic Batum when he decided to stay with the Blazers. Whatever.
Robot Mojo::Wolves will get sold to Turkey. Good luck with that.
mattgaea55::i love how the big euros get no love, pekovic , vucevic, and asik are ballin but their teams dont wanna give them the ball
Vega_2012::Asik is a rebounding machine with a developing offensive game
mattgaea55::ok hes more of a garbage man type player but the other two should be gettin the ball more
Dame Lillard::"I know. It pisses me off."  -Darko Milicic
BootyLoaf.::asik isn't a guy that gets plays called for him..
Dame Lillard::My my, what a high scoring affair ORL-PHI was...
Robot Mojo::Lakers are so bad. Could beat the Wolves in 3 quarters with time to spare.
Mittens___the cat::what does he have to do with the wolves and blazers? go back to the cavs board
CoryJBogie::He's been posting this on every board
Robot Mojo::Blazers win. Should have kept the score at double digits. Wolves will sit in the cellar for the next  5 years.
dlhouse18::Yes! No more Darrell Powe!!
Not Not A Wolves Fan::k off to bed.  this board ended up being very entertaining. blazer fans not so bad.  byyyyyyyye
Dame Lillard::Not not not so bad?

bstanto_08::its become a trademark phrase hear in minnesota for multiple sports....always next year
Vega_2012::I love me some Love
Vega_2012::So its a dump?
Dame Lillard::No. Nice city, but too many homeless and heroin. And a ton of gentlemen's clubs.
Dame Lillard::Can't buy me love...
Dame Lillard::Come to PDX...  Like Las Vegas minus the casinos...
Vega_2012::Prostitutes, my friend.
Minnysota Vikings::For all the Wolves fans that are being super negative about this team, have you noticed that Rubio has been continuously getting stronger and stronger since coming back? He played well the past few games and now just had the best game of the season so far. When healthy, this team is much better than the team that was 21-20 last year.
Robot Mojo::Pee on Rubio. Loser.
dlhouse18::Hard not to be negative when you drop 12/14
Minnysota Vikings::yes, but the team that dropped 12/14 isn't the REAL Wolves team. Yes, the Wolves will probably not make the playoffs this year, but next year we should be good to go as long as the injury curse doesn't strike again.
bstanto_08::yep always next year...until next year then ...oh wait next year
Not Not A Wolves Fan::"when healthy" biggest concern though
