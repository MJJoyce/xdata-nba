1STOCKTONN4TIVE::ESPN says the CHEATS got a 34% chance of beating us, looks like that streak is gonna end. #BOSTON4LIFE #BEATTHECHEATS
Road dog Red::only 18 games LEFT
Celtics1634::C's!
Lebroncouldcareless::DAMN NOT EVEN  2000 COMMENTS  WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!
Lebroncouldcareless::HEY PP,,,,,,,,LOL PEE PEE  IM FREE TO GO TO WHATEVER  BOARD I LIKE   BUBBA!
oreed8::GOD kobe is a whining b%tch! jones did everything to stop kobe...kobe kick his leg &amp; landed on  his own ankle
Lebroncouldcareless::COME MONDAY NIGHT C's  ARE JUST ANOTHER VICTIM!!
Philipcarpenter11::the Cs always play you heat hard get ready for a game
TDOTNATION22::Miami is playing back 2 back game coming to Boston...
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Good point.
TDOTNATION22::Playing in Toronto on Sunday, then to Boston on Monday...But the Toronto games i 1:00pm ET so probably they will be ready for that game.
ThatsGoodSoup7963::I didn't know that.
ThatsGoodSoup7963::We'll see.
PP owns Rondo::Nope. Last time they came to Boston, Miami lost without Rondo being there.
Lebroncouldcareless::LEBRON IS NOT IMPRESSED!
PP owns Rondo::Who gives a fk?
Saaywuttdogg::Him mad?  LOL ok Tarzan.
PP owns Rondo::False, get out of here, moron.
Lebroncouldcareless::YOU DO BUBBA!  YOU REPLIED!  LMAO  HIM MAD
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Yeeeeee!!! Very nice win, Boston keeps becoming more of a historic team and a contender this year. #keep winning
rondo2KG::Terrence Williams looks just like Eric Strickland holy $@%!
rondo2KG::Look it up then come back to me.  Tony Allen looks like Sugar Shane Mosely too.  Josh Smith looks like th The Game.    Facts.
Celtics1634::Are you saying all black people look the same?  That's pretty messed up dude.  Just wait till Road Dog gets here
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Glen Davis, Tony Allen, Greg Stiemsma are the C's players we lost recently that I miss the most. Honorable mention to Nate Robinson (he's a bit of a liability, but I love his spark and energy off the bench) and Kendrick Perkins. Jeff Green just recently started to produce, so I don't feel as strongly about the Perkins trade as I used to.   Aw, hell, let's face it. Ray Allen, too. JET is cool and everything, but Allen is the man. Wish he had stuck around.
jbezerra1990::I'm still convinced we should have won that game 7 in LA. The refs F-ed us royally. 22 Free throws in the 4th quarter?
ThatsGoodSoup7963::It's in the past, and nothing will change the fact that LA got to raise #16 after that game...   ...but you are totally right. The biggest f'ing joke of a final period I've ever seen. C's got positively ROBBED.
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Yeah I miss them too. I miss Rasheed Wallace, unfortunately his back kept giving him problems but when he did play he gave us a boost on both sides plus he could hit the three. He even helped out in the playoffs, a lil bit.
Celtics1634::We could definitely use Ray on this team.  Jet is ok but Ray was the better fit  There are some rumors about the Thunder wanting to amnesty Perkins in the off-season.  I wouldn't mind him back in Boston, but for no more than $7mil/yr AT MOST.  Either way, I don't think they can even offer more than the mid-level exception, which isn't quite $7mi/year.  I'd rather them spend that money on someone who can score
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Yeah, I heard some of those rumblings. I would be cool with Perkins return, he's still a good defender and capable starting centers are so hard to come by in the league these days. I could see him and Sullinger working well together.
Jimmy30313::Ah Greg Stiemsma, "The Great White Swipe."
Celtics1634::Telfair and Lowry had nightmares of Avery Bradley last night.  Freaking Telfair got so frustrated that he ended up getting tossed!  Shoulda one to college kid
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Damn, I remember when Bradley was a rookie I used to hate him cuz he sucked but he's really developed. He's a beast now and a nice addition to our team. I still remember when he blocked the $h!t outta sheWade, EPIC
Jimmy30313::lol some raptor fan was on here saying that Lowry would dominate Avery
Celtics1634::hahah I remember that.  Funny how he isn't here today
Jimmy30313::Apparently Mickael Pietrus wishes he was still in Boston. I miss that guy
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Man that dude was koo on our team, even better than he was in Orlando.
Jimmy30313::I know, he was probably the best player on a really bad bench last year. He probably wouldnt see many minutes on this years team. Way deeper
Celtics1634::The poor guy gets zero run in toronto.  There's no place for him here though
Celtics1634::On other thought, screw him.  He's making a million dollars not doing anything!
tmoneyinmphs::Grizzlies are 16-3 since getting rid of rudy gay.  Meanwhile, rudy keeps jacking up the misses.  The difference in toronto is they don't have enough good players to carry rudy gay's overrated $@%.  That's what was going on in memphis.  Conley, zbo, gasol, and tony allen would do all the hard work.  Rudy is soft.
Levis107::Funny how two NBA greats move up on the top 20 of the NBA scoring list, and apparently ESPN doesn't think it's front page worthy. They don't respect history. Pierce will stay underrated his entire career.
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Kobe's "boo-boo" is more important to the league and the great tradition of the NBA than two living legends making history together, on the same team, on the same night.
Lebroncouldcareless::F THEM BOTH
Celtics1634::And KG &gt; Jerry West
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Yup.
ThatsGoodSoup7963::So, it's official now, right?   PP &gt; Barkley.
Celtics1634::I would say so
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Go PP! Go KG! Go CELTICS!
Celtics1634:::)
Darla5568::Go Celtics!!!!!!!!!!          http://GameHighlights.qr.net/sportnewshourly
mymomdunkedonyourmom::been following this betting system called Sportsbettingstar the past couple of months. Im making around $3000 a month profit just following these systems for betting. You will find the system on the front page of google by searching for basketball betting systems
Jimmy30313::Do we have the tie breaker over the bulls?
floydcaywood::I suppose 15 more wins is to much to ask for,huh?
floydcaywood::Kobe out indefinitely
Syrindge::I don't believe it. Dude is a drama queen. He'll "miraculously" play Friday as long as he doesn't catch the flu for the 100th time in his career.
iamjayee::This is what I call Inconcistency for my C's
Johnnyboii3931::JEFF GREEN YOU STUD!

Roll to 15::this day was the day of the Blow out there were 8 blow outs on 11 games Wow.
Roll to 15::both I guess.
TDOTNATION22::Or the day of injuries
Roll to 15::Melo got hurt again.
Roll to 15::sorry I did need instead of knee at first on accident.
Roll to 15::hurt his knee again I think.
Dribbird.::What happened?
Roll to 15::yes, but before you say anything else  be classy we are Boston that's what we are known for.
Dribbird.::Did he really?
NBA1964::Gay took 19 shots...now you know why the Raptors lose.
Roll to 15::its funny and interesting that NBA1964 has 4 NBA teams as his favorites well....I guess that's why he is the NBA.
Roll to 15::Thank you TDOTNATION22!
TDOTNATION22::We lost because C's are just too good
Jbrad24seven113::Haha.. U must be the president of the new Rudy Gay Fan Club Toronto Chapter!! I see the 22 in ur name.. Too funny.. U just don't have a clue
DeadmanSoxFan15::Celtics WILL end the streak.  Bring on the Heat!
Roll to 15::yeah, agree with you the Bucks do always seem to give the Heat problems but I think the C's will.
Roll to 15::Boston ends it.
Roll to 15::yeah, agree I have Boston winning and I think Boston is capable of blowing them out.
TDOTNATION22::For some reason Bucks has heat #'s
Paul41066::I think Milwaukee ends it on friday.
TDOTNATION22::Raptors will end it on sunday tho
TDOTNATION22::Is @ Toronto
Roll to 15::DeadmanSoxFan15 - I'd be fine with that.  I'm sick of hearing/reading about it!  yeah but I still want Boston to.
Roll to 15::hey, maybe the Heat almost lost to the Magic, 76ers,
DeadmanSoxFan15::I'd be fine with that.  I'm sick of hearing/reading about it!
TDOTNATION22::Ross , DeRozan, Gay all need to go to the gym this summer and work on their 3pt and mid range game
Jbrad24seven113::Rudy has never been good at 3pt shooting &amp; now in his 8th yr.. Safe to say he never will be
Paul41066::With 18 games left in the season,C,s close it 14-4 or 13-5!!
Roll to 15::I'm just saying Boston since they first started playing were the most classy team in the NBA lets keep it that way.
Roll to 15::yes, but that's what's good about us the classiness.
Paul41066::OK, but I,m still not convinced!!
Roll to 15::and Melo, but hey Paul41066 we got to be classy we don't want players to get hurt.
Paul41066::Why not ??All non Boston fans wish the same upon us!!
TDOTNATION22::Melo is also not 100%
Roll to 15::yeah.
Roll to 15::yeah, tough loss for the knicks with him going down.
Roll to 15::he hurt his Knee.
Paul41066::Amare ,s out too!!
Roll to 15::if Boston could get the 3 seed and home court that would be great and one of the best come back by a team, because we were 20-23 8th seed then getting the 3 seed would be amazing.
Paul41066::Lets call a spade a spade.The knicks are done!!
TDOTNATION22::If they do i say C's are 3rd especially with TC now out for the knicks
TDOTNATION22::He just injured his knee..No words from anyone yet
Paul41066::What happen to Tyson Chandler??
Roll to 15::yep.
TDOTNATION22::C's has the 5th seed...they need to get 4th seed
Roll to 15::yeah.
Roll to 15::24 point win for Boston.
Roll to 15::103-68 the Kings are beating the Bulls that's good for us.
TDOTNATION22::TRoss thinks all he can do is dunk...Get your jumper going
Paul41066::We,ll take the dunk anyways!!
Roll to 15::I'm just shocked to see a Raptors fan saying that.
TDOTNATION22::We'lll after winning the Slam dunk contest his three pointer just aint going down
Roll to 15::Boston has the 5th seed.
Roll to 15::yep, always.
Roll to 15::me too.
Paul41066::When the C,s bench rolls,so do the C,s !!
Paul41066::Love it!!!
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Wow nice bounce back game after the pathetic effort yesterday
Roll to 15::yep, that's the C's for us.
Roll to 15::broncomike7562 ''Agreed! How many times were we counted out in 2009-10 after bad losses during the regular season, and stumbling to a 21-21 record over the last 2 games, and a 4th seed, only to knock off the top 2 teams in the East, and take the defending champion Lakers to the final minutes of Game 7 before coming up short (after losing Perkins early in Game 6), and how many times were we counted out last season, after bad losses during the regular season, only to reach the East Finals, before falling in Game 7 to Miami. That's why you never, ever count these Cetlics out!''  Agree, and here is another example vs the Nets at home when we lost in 2010 the nets were the worse team in NBA Basketball that year.
komu93910::we need to pakage bargnani with rudy in a trade next year and tank the season ..maybe stern will rig the lottery to get us the hometown favourite
Jumeax::What GM would be stupid enough to take Bargnani and Gay...  thoughts 1. KOBE needs more help.... KOBE always needs more help for him to "lead" the lakers to championships, even the most physicala nd the most skilled center in basketball aint cutting hin But LA wont help you  you only have one hope....  2.  KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
Celtics1634::It's hard to see Stern or Silver allowing the Raptors to win the lottery again.  But I guess if the cavs get to win it twice, why not the Raptors?
Roll to 15::5th seed here we come!!!! the Bulls are down 18 points,  Boston is one of the Best teams in Basketball at putting games behind them and moving on love that about Boston.
Roll to 15::much agreed. ;)
broncomike7562::Agreed!  How many times were we counted out in 2009-10 after bad losses during the regular season, and stumbling to a 21-21 record over the last 2 games, and a 4th seed, only to knock off the top 2 teams in the East, and take the defending champion Lakers to the final minutes of Game 7 before coming up short (after losing Perkins early in Game 6), and how many times were we counted out last season, after bad losses during the regular season, only to reach the East Finals, before falling in Game 7 to Miami.  That's why you never, ever count these Cetlics out!
laytonwasasocialist::welllll.. aboot time to hit the dusty trail..........  it's been an enriching experience.
