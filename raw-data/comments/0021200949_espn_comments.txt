MauiiNoKaOii::If the Met's have more wins in a season than the Yankee's, does that mean that there is a changing of the guard or the Yankee's are done? As a L.A. native and born into a Laker's house-hold. I find it extremely annoying that L.A. fans flip-flop as much as they do. Media-driven maybe? I may hate the Boston Celtics, Redsox, New York Yankees, Knicks. But I respect those Celtics fans and those Yankee's fans because regardless of the record or outcome of the season, they are those teams FANS. Clippers, finally have a good team and all of a sudden they are L.A.'s team? Those 10 championships Dr. Buss brought to L.A. means nothing now? Where's the respect
dennis580::How in the world does a player shoot 39 FTA's that is just insane.? Totally insane.
TWex2120::intentional fouls. The magic forced him to the line since he is normally a poor ft shooter
jereomy_420@yahoo.com::When the game slows down come playoff time.. The Lakers size and experience will take them to the finals
sachit747::For all of you laker haters out there, they are going to make the playoffs and be legitimate threat to the team they play in the first round.
LetsGoBlue20130::isn't it amazing how the story has changed?  at first it was "lakers are a lock to win it all.  you must be a hater if you don't agree."  now you're a hater if you don't agree the lakers will "have a chance" in the FIRST round of the playoffs.
scabbfan::kobrick does well at home aginst weak teams. Unfortunately, won't meet weak teams or have home court in playoffs.
gatorfan808::I believe they will make the playoffs and be the 7th or 6th seed.  They haven't proved that they can win on the road so the legitimate threat thing is questionable.  If they play the Spurs or Thunder, they will have to win at least 2 on the road to win the series because the Thunder or Spurs will steal one game in LA.  Best chance for the Lakers is to play the Clippers the first round because it really isn't an away game for them.
tonichifi::What ar "you guys" taliKng about when you say CHEMISTRY IS IMPORTANT?  Kobe is right, IT IS A JOB and they don't have to LOVE EACH OTHER.  AS AN EXAMPOLE, I don't have to love my co-workers but I workt with them enthusiastically.
scabbfan::But kobrick disrespects &amp; makes his teammates worse. Takes all credit for wins &amp; throws them under the bus when loses.
timbeebe2::The Eastern conference is a joke
scabbfan::Eastern Conference Miami won the NBA Title last year. Hmmmmmmmm.....?
jrosborough08::As the playoffs gets close, the Lakers will continue to get better. When it starts they WILL cause their 1st opponent some serious problems.
scabbfan::They will cause their 1st opponent to keep starters in for 1st Qtr.
gatorfan808::One thing that was solidified in this game is that Jacque Vaughn is a terrible coach.
Bucks_fan_for_real.....::The Lakers have only beaten under .500 teams lately.  And beating Orlando by 9 isn't something to be overly happy about.  Orlando has so many injuries and Vucevic was also injured.  If the Lakers get in the playoffs it won't matter.  They are 5-18 against West playoff teams I believe.  Howard should leave.  Kobe will retire soon and Lakers are a bust team.  He should go to Houston with James Harden.
LeeFortier::Interesting how you discount wins against tteams that your team might beat and then make excuses about someone being injured and yet do not give credit for all the injuries the Lakers have gone through, only pointing to a record gained by a team with a Center recovering from surgery, starting pf out for months, back up pf out for months, starting sg out for months, backup sg out for months along with players pushing through problems and STILL making the playoffs. Playing really well lately now that they are getting healthy....watch out
jrosborough08::That doesn't make sense.  The Lakers lost games as they were going thru problems.  They've only lost 6 games since the all-star break.
1magic2jordan::Why would Howard want to live in Texas when he has the sun, beach, and the sand.  Fat people and southern cooking doesnt entice me either
mccoy3181::Your an idiot
jrosborough08::This is the least competitive I've seen the Eastern Conference EVER!!!
jrosborough08::The EAST used to have competitive teams in Boston, Philly, Chicago, etc. But because of injuries this year the nearest team to Miami is 10 games behind....  ... that's not competitive.
DownloadFirefox::You must be 12 because the East was historically bad from 01 to 07
jrosborough08::The next team to the #1 seed is 10 games behind. That's NOT COMPETITIVE.
Mamba Rigatoni::Lakers half court is not better than the Spurs and it sure isn't as fast as The Thunder.  I'm not too sold on the Lakers just because they have Kobe Bryant.
Mihir45::Lol come talk to me when the Lakers don't win a championship in the next 25 years
Go Laker Nation::PLease  Duncan is a shell of himself and gets worked all the time the past few years. A healthy Lakers team will eat them alive in a series.
gatorfan808::You are delusional.  Duncan is not the dominant force he once was but to say Gasol or Howard will eat him up alive is one of the dumbest comments I have ever seen.  They don't even eat up Kendrick Perkins.  The Lakers got two legitimate players: Bryant and Howard, that is it.  Fact is Nash is out of his prime and Tony Parker will eat him alive in a series.
This is Los Angeles::The playoffs benefit the Lakers game where the game starts to slow down and turn into a half court game. Metta and Kobe can lock shooters down and nobody has ever locked up Kobe. We need to get Gasol back into the mix too. Keep it moving Lakers.
T_Macc81::Metta aint locking up nothing. He has looked the worst on offense and defense than I ever seen him.
Go Laker Nation::Lakers have advantage in half court sets FOR SURE.
timbeebe2::18-6 after tonight's game
jrosborough08::The Lakers win tonight and they're in 7th place....and they keep climbing and climbing.
DownloadFirefox::So you'd get to lose to OKC instead of the Spurs in the first round.  Either way it doesn't matter.
jrosborough08::This Lakers team playing to their potential CAN defeat both OKC (whom they'd already beat this year) AND Spurs.
Jubin3567::The only team that should concern Miami is the Spurs. Besides their ridiculous chemistry, Popovich would coach circles around Spo.
Jubin3567::How have they shown their best hand ? LeBron's always played lights out and Wade's back to his normal self. The only difference they've shown this year is an improved mid-range game and more possessions.
timbeebe2::I can't stand the Heat but I know they are great
jrosborough08::Miami WILL have trouble in the East. They have shown their best hand.
jrosborough08::The Lakers half-court offense puts the ball in the hands of their best shooters: Kobe &amp; Nash; they feed Dwight pretty well; the bench plays well....they're looking good.
jrosborough08::Miami may have shot their load early. Will they have enough during playoffs to fight off teams that really won't to be the ones who knock them out of the playoffs.
Disturbed99x::I just can't see anyone in the league beating them 4 times in a 7 game series.  Miami will have to suffer a major injury at this point not to win it all.
Jubin3567::LeBron's just been polishing his mid-range lately. Notice that he doesn't work the post like he did earlier in the season...when he has lately he's passed it to someone cutting for an easy assist.   Me thinks he'll revert back to that come playoff time when everyone has slept on preparing for that aspect of his game.
jrosborough08::I can see them losing. LeBron has shown everyone their best card. But the Pacers haven't!
jrosborough08::All a team has to do is win 1 game in Miami and they gain home-court advantage.  This will benefit the Pacers.
Jubin3567::They're front court is physical, which is what gave Miami fits earlier. The key is to tire them out by having them chase around our wings through screen switches.  Also, Birdman's presence as really brought a change. His ability to finish with some consistency, while doing a decent job defending, and boxing out has been key.
Jubin3567::they've managed their minutes perfectly during the win streak. LeBron only had 30 mins last night, i think
Jubin3567::Miami's talent will trump any home court advantage. Teams may sneak in a win or two, but I can't see Miami losing 4 in a series.
jrosborough08::It'll be different against teams who get one win in Miami, and change the entire series in the playoffs.  The pressure is on Miami to keep it going.
Jubin3567::Coffee dumps are the worst
jrosborough08::A good Lakers team will be able to neutralize the Spurs half-court offense, Denver's &amp; Clippers' fast break point, and Memphis...well, they won't be as good without Gay!
TWex2120::This ans your other posts are just downright stupid. I guess LA is just perfect right? They are not title contenders. Get over it.
Jubin3567::Lakers half-court defense is atrocious. They really should invest in a perimeter defender.
Jubin3567::No, I haven't but I've read they've made some adjustments. I need to see them succeed with more consistency. Teams will take note of their adjustment when reviewing the tape eventually and respond. If the Lakers can still succeed then I'll be impressed.
jrosborough08::You haven't watched the Lakers lately.
Go Laker Nation::I hope Nash plays good in the post season so  he can have some good value and we can trade for a real championship level point guard. **crossing fingers**
Jubin3567::It won't change the fact that he's 39 and moves like a cement truck
Jubin3567::Patrick Beverley comes to mind  Maybe you can pry Lillard in a few years and hope he improves his on the ball defense
Go Laker Nation::I want a smaller name young buck with D who we can mold
TheSpecialOnce::It's been a blast, ladies. And you too, Laker Nation!
J1133B::The Lakers lose = Hahahahahahaha the Lakers suck! Kobe is a brick master hahahahaha  The Lakers win = The league rigged the game, it's hard to lose when you are playing 8 against 5.  Sincerely Trolls
jrosborough08::So true!
jrosborough08::The top teams NOT playing their potential:  1) Lakers 2) Pacers 3) Bulls  When the Lakers start playing "their" game in the playoffs, they'll be dangerous!
Jubin3567::Bulls have injury issues up to wahoo  Pacers are in good shape but I'm not sure how they'll incorporate Granger with Paul George blossoming at the 3 (maybe shift Granger to the 2 ?)  Lakers...well...yeah
Jubin3567::Regular season outcomes mean zilch. 2 years ago both Bulls and Celtics swept Heat in the regular season and Heat responded with a gentlemens sweep of both of them.  Granger might be counter-productive for them until he gets in mid-season form.
jrosborough08::If Granger was there they'd probably swept Miami in the regualr series matchup
Go Laker Nation::I always liked the Pacers.  Hibbert is the key with them
--------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS NATION--------::Peace out Laker Fans going back to work.&amp;      LETS GO L.A!!!!

--------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS NATION--------::I see it.Lol

mccoy3181::its nice we can agree that they suck
Go Laker Nation::Yes, yes, we know we know LOL
ElvinHayesRules::The Lakers are just the 3 refs from Game 7 of the 2010 Finals away from making a playoff run...
tom bradys ugg::heats championship season was fixed
ElvinHayesRules::Definitely a fixed game, no real doubt. Kobe took as many FTs as the entire Celts team.  The fix was in that day.
jino_in_the_blueravine17::both teams were equally deserving to win that game,we got calls because we were at home, not gonna deny that, however you can't say we weren't worthy of a ring
TheSpecialOnce::splitting hairs is the only way for them to try and get some B.S. in.
This is Los Angeles::The Lakers offense finally looks good because Howard is ale to run pick and rolls one one side and still control the paint on the other side. The defense still needs to pick it up but their getting better because their getting healthier. Then Gasol will come off the bench and bring in more scoring and a 7'-0'er
LeeFortier::Pau doesn't really complain much, pout a bit maybe. Pau is  team guy and he will do what is asked. Based upon his history he should start but with so many missed games this year by multiple players, the chemistry and understand of how to play together as a team has been seriously affected. They are just recently getting to where they should have been months ago
Jubin3567::The Lakers should just start him with Dwight at tip-off and then bench one of them early and sub him in with the second unit gradually. That way he won't complain about not technically being a starter and will get more reps.
Jubin3567::Assuming Gasol doesn't complain about coming off the bench
jino_in_the_blueravine17::hopefully not, however I think winning takes precedent in his mind
ElvinHayesRules::I bet the return of Gasol just screws the Lakers up. D'Antoni has never seemed sure how to use him, and now he'll be on the rebound physically.
ElvinHayesRules::you wish...
jino_in_the_blueravine17::He'll come off the bench and be the best guy on the floor against the opposition's reserves
sternshot44::So Laker haters chime in saying the Lakers victory last night was nothing because Orlando is the worst team in the league, scrubs, lottery team etc...but last week when the Heat beat them by just ONE POINT they must have been title contenders because it was a great win for the Heat. You see the flaw in your logic Haters/Heat fans?
Jubin3567::Heat have always had trouble against teams with size. Orlando has that.   Lakers have the deepest front court in the league, arguably, and have a backcourt that's superior to the Magic. No reason why you guys shouldn't have blown them out.
ElvinHayesRules::Why are you hating on the Heat hater?
BigBadLakers420::Lakers got their act together and figured eachother out. Lakers are a top 4 team in all NBA since the all star break. D12 is getting healthy. Coach has had enough practices to know what rotations work. Lakers are peaking at the right time. Yes they can win it all because its the Lakers and we have the greatest player on the planet and the best big man on the planet with a solid bench! So its very feasable the Lakers make history and win it all as a 6th, 7th, or 8th seed. Is it a lock , of course not but I like our chances! JB.
ElvinHayesRules::This team might win a playoff GAME, but they won't win a series...

Basketball Facts::1. If Tony Parker isn't back from that Ankle injury; I don't see them getting passed the Clippers or the Thunder in a 7 game series.  2.  With Pau close returning; the Lakers can only get better,  The team chemistry is great atm with Kobe and Nash making plays to find Dwight open instead of trying to force feed causing turnovers.  3.  If Russell Westbrook continues to play like he is better than Durant; The Thunder will choke again and not have James Harden to bail them out.  4.  The Rockets &amp; Knicks have similar styles of being an outside shooting team.  The only team of recent history that got hot and made it to the final were Hedo, Lewis and the magic in 2010.
Basketball Facts::If tony parker isn't back for the playoffs, then the spurs are royally screwed.
ucangetthebozackagain2::Why'd you say that? You KNOW he can't read and comprehend it...

mccoy3181::ha ha ha ha.  Champs my a$$
This is Los Angeles::There is no other franchise in the NBA as consistent in winning as the Lakers.
LeeFortier::Spurs have been a very good team for q while, but the only thing better than watching the Lakers knock them off is beating the Celtics
mccoy3181::The Spurs have been more consistent than the Fakers.  In the last 25 years the Spurs have missed the playoffs once.  FACT
tsubusu420::Jubin... are you saying history is not and has never been an indicator of things to come.  In 1999 all the lakers championships were history.  The went on to win 3.  The shaq, kobe, phil days were history in 2007.  Phil comes back and they win 2 more.  Now those championships are history.  Lakers are always there.
tsubusu420::Sorry but cap rules hurt the lakers.  Without a cap or luxery tax they would have a five all-star starting lineup every other year.  "Trade rapes" dont exist seeing as how both teams must give consent to a trade, so just call that an awesome Lakers front office.  And as far as the fortune of teams.  The lakers have beaten teams that weren't suffering from injuries in the finals before, and they have become champions with injured teams.  Consistent exellence is rarely random.
Jubin3567::My argument wasn't aimed exclusively at the Lakers. It applies to every team. You can break down my points and argue that they apply but only in the context of a season, but you forget that these individual seasons add up together and the sum is the Lakers history.
tsubusu420::Level of cometition: Erving and the Sixers, and the greatest Celtics team ever. Trade rape?  You mean a good front office that knows how to get results. And any rules involving cap space hurt the lakers (unless the rule was to eliminate luxery tax and hard cap).  And the fortune of other teams is something that you can argue about over a season, but not so much over decades.  Did every team they beat have horrible injuries?  Did the lakers not win with injured players?
Jubin3567::Thanks Lee. Might as well spark some good debate and change up the ESPN boards once in a while.
LeeFortier::Wow Jubin, that was actually well thought out and presented ...so many are simply haters who arenot capable of a decent conversation...
Jubin3567::The fortune of other teams (i.e., injuries, upsets), the # of teams in the league at the time, the level of competition relative to the talent on the roster, trade rapes that the Lakers benefited from (not holding it against them, every other team would pull the trigger too) and  CBA parameters (cap space scenarios).   The Lakers FO has historically done great, but to discredit everything else is a little unfair, imo.
tsubusu420::the mechanism that got them there is the repeated assembly of championship caliber teams by an intelligent front office and a group of owners unafraid to spend.  You said other factors outweigh that.  Id like to hear those factors
Jubin3567::You're looking at the Final outcome. Not at the mechanism of how they got there. History does tend to repeat itself, but there are other factors that outweigh that.
LeeFortier::Comprehension is a wonderful thing..stay in school. Until Riley the Laker showed Miami how it is done they won nothing...hard to live with and hard to digest I guess.
Jubin3567::"And how many without the help of bringing in a Laker (Riley) to show them how it is done? Is that why you are so upset, knowing that it took a Laker to help you even get one?"  The above was stated by you. I'm not sure if you have a very firm grasp on the English language...but that's what it definitely means.
LeeFortier::And thats why it too so long to understand? Misquote and argue against something that was not said. Let me quote Forest Gump for you, Stupid is as stupid does
Jubin3567::You're saying Riley= Laker. Therefore, Riley in Miami + winning championships= because of his Lakers culture.   It's not difficult to understand, it's just stupid.
LeeFortier::And that is not what was said at all..again comprehension
Jubin3567::Riley was part of Miami's team early in the franchises history. He did a masterful job with the Lakers, I won't deny that...but to say that LA is the sole reason Riley was successful is beyond asinine.
LeeFortier::Since 79 they have won 10 times. Does that fit your timeframe better? How many have your team the heat won? And how many without the help of bringing in a Laker (Riley) to show them how it is done?  Is that why you are so upset, knowing that it took a Laker to help you even get one?
Jubin3567::wow. Riley was the reason LA won, not the other way around. LA has also had a plethora of hall of famers on their roster since 79 so that's expected.
This is Los Angeles::Kobe guaranteed it. You always double down on a Kobe guarantee.
This is Los Angeles::The correct thing to do is just agree. But you're a moron who doesn't know anything about sports. The Lakers have missed the playoffs only 4 times in their existence.
Jubin3567::He's taking it pretty hard. He'll come to terms with the truth over time.
--------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS NATION--------::Jubin3567 - Yes, I'm mad that "my team haves no history".

Jubin3567::Yes, I'm mad that "my team haves no history". Are you mad because Wade is better than Kobe and because the closest that LA will get to sniffing a title will be through the Clippers ?
--------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS NATION--------::This is Los Angeles - The correct thing to do is just agree. But you're a moron who doesn't know anything about sports. The Lakers have missed the playoffs only 4 times in their existence.   Agree 1000%
--------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS NATION--------::Jubin3567 - Yeah, anyone who doesn't pay attention to the Lakers schedule and memorize their history instead of focusing on the real world is clearly an imbecile. Thanks for the epiphany.   Are u mad cause ur team haves no history.
Jubin3567::Yeah, anyone who doesn't pay attention to the Lakers schedule and memorize their history instead of focusing on the real world is clearly an imbecile. Thanks for the epiphany.
Chris Dorner::Lakers are still dangerous come playoffs.  They just need to play their pace throughout the game.  That is if they make the playoffs...
Jubin3567::Not a lot of franchises have been around as long as the Lakers.
tsubusu420::Soo.  Whats youre point.  Lets just count post merger titles then.  That means the lakers are the best team with the most titles.  Lets just count the championships from the 80s on.  Still have the most titles.  What is your point.
Jubin3567::It's a fact. The Lakers have had more opportunities to play games, thus potentially win compared to the majority of teams. Not a knock on them, just simply a fact.
TheSpecialOnce::What kind of response is that? You have nothing to say. You're like 5 hours late. Go shave the hair on your back.
This is Los Angeles::NBA championships: 1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1972, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010
ucangetthebozackagain2::"You guys keep living in the past" - Laker fans' response to the history of ANY team other than the Lakers...
DownloadFirefox::Someone's living in the past.  That's something people do when they have nothing going for them in the present.
TheSpecialOnce::lame response. you and jubin must be sisters. i'll bet your parents were brother and sister.
MauiiNoKaOii::Respect.
TheSpecialOnce::You forgot one. NBL title in 1948...The Celtics claim all those lame-a.s.s titles from the late 50's and early 60's with only 8 teams in the league.
--------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS NATION--------::Jubin3567 - What you said makes no sense at all. Please untighten your helmet a notch and try again.  I said then why is it hard for u follow that the Lakers won those championships as a Lakers team regardless I'd it was in Minnie.MAN UR AN IDIOT.
Jubin3567::What you said makes no sense at all. Please untighten your helmet a notch and try again.
--------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS NATION--------::Jubin3567 - That some of the championships were not won in LA. I don't think it's very hard to follow.  Then why is it hard for u to follow.....hmmmmmm  you must be slow.
Jubin3567::That some of the championships were not won in LA. I don't think it's very hard to follow.
--------LOS ANGELES LAKERS DODGERS KINGS NATION--------::Jubin3567 - Lets not forget some of those were won when they were in Minneapolis too    There is no difference they still represent the Lakers u idiot.
TheSpecialOnce::Jubin3567 - Lets not forget some of those were won when they were in Minneapolis  So,whats your point?
Jubin3567::Lets not forget some of those were won when they were in Minneapolis too
LeeFortier::Wont make pllayoffs from 13th place lol    wont make playoffs from 12th place lol    wont make playoffs from 11th place lol   wont make ahhh damn nevermind......LOL  These are the Lakers. The ones who have missed the playoffs 2 times since 79 and have 16 championships so I understand the hatred of a team who has made other teams green with envy and their fans dreaming they could do the same. Great to be a Laker fan
MauiiNoKaOii::Lakers are in 8th place. And like 1 1/2 games out of the 6th seed.
Jubin3567::OH OH you made a Jew reference. According to you, that's "racism".
MauiiNoKaOii::Jewbin, you know nothing. You take pride in getting under peoples skins. People like you should be castrated
Jubin3567::Surely the 6th seed will make a worlds difference in the final outcome
Chris Dorner::Clippers vs Lakers 1st Round
MauiiNoKaOii::IMAO did you not understand that?
MauiiNoKaOii::Lakers vs Spurs  Lakers &gt; Spurs  Lakers vs. Clips next Lakers &gt; Clips Lakers vs. OKC Lakers &gt; OKC
Jubin3567::lmao did you just say the Lakers are better than the Spurs AND Thunder ?
Jubin3567::Lets be realistic here. Should the Lakers somehow squeeze their way into the playoffs, they'll get bounced immediately.
tsubusu420::Seeing as how Mexicans consider themselves a different race and nationality than say, panamanians, Im inclined to agree with them.
MauiiNoKaOii::thank you Stephen A. Smith. So knowledgable. Lakers have won 16 out of 23 games? Um... I agree everyone would love to punch that baby's face you dumbas.s
Jubin3567::Never knew that Mexican was a race. Thanks for the ground-breaking discovery.
MauiiNoKaOii::bring up racism. real intelligent of you. you must have a great life in OKC. Thank god I don't live in OKC!
Jubin3567::At least you acknowledge the Lakers blow goat scrotes. Nice to see the Mexican community in LA is competent.
TheSpecialOnce::And?.
Go Laker Nation::Lakers fans are the stupid ones whose favorite team has all the championships.  Joke is on you chuckleheads lol
Corvo Attano::laker fans are truly stupid
tsubusu420::And your post screams intelligence.
TheSpecialOnce::And now haters completely out of ammo.
MauiiNoKaOii::A. you liked your own post. B. you're in a Laker article C. You're not stupid, you're Pathetic!
timbeebe2::Go troll on a Heat board loser
raquan.gray::I knew we would pull it together #lakers allday/patriots!

LeeFortier::That is what people do when they come to the Laker articles to troll...how veruy observant of you
Jubin3567::Heat also demolished the Thunder twice, while the Thunder branded the Lakers

DownloadFirefox::The Heat also beat the Lakers twice
MauiiNoKaOii::Heat also hasn't lost 4 or 5 players to month long injuries with new system and new coach and 4 new starters haha
Corvo Attano::comparing heat to lakers.  wow
MauiiNoKaOii::haha I know. Lakers 2 championships in last 5 years. Miami 1 championship last 5 years. Un-fair
numb1lakefanespn::hawks got beat by kobe single handedly smh
Corvo Attano::if only the lakers could play 4 rounds against the magic
Mamba Rigatoni::Now Atlanta has Al Horford and Josh Smith.  If they could give Dwight some trouble in the post and force Mamba to play Hero Ball.....the Hawks will win tonight.
Jubin3567::The Hawks automatically win because they have Ivan Johnson
