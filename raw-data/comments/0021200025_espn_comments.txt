PEFS76::This team is the Philadelphia Eagles of basketball. Looks good on paper, but unable to perform as a team with or without Steve Nash.
Mac271::$@%!$@% turnovers. Look at the FG attempt discrepancy Lakers only took 68 shots.. not going to get it done.
CowboyzDFDub::We would've won of I hadn't had that one assist   -Kobe
paris1nd::Can someone name me a coach who has done less with more than Mike Brown? This is not knee jerk reaction to there start this is reality.  As an organization, and I am saying this as a Laker obsessed fan of 30 years, Steve Blake is terrible, I agree with the Bynum trade only because he was a baby but Dwight is not as good and cannot get the ball in the 4th quarter if it is close and what is he going to do when Kobe retires? Pau Gasol has no place in the offense and cannot defend.  Nash is still playing at a very high level when healthy but he has to do what he does, pick and roll.  He has as good a handle as anyone in the league and is in as good as shape still as anyone( league players said as much when they said nash, ray allen, and richard hamilton never get tired).  Kobe cannot do 40 minutes a night for 82 games + playoffs for 2 more years and b at a high level, and even if he can the fact that he would have to is more worrisome.  Mike Brown is a so-called defensive genius?  It is going to be a long, frustrating talk to yourself year for Laker fans
DBRacing83::The Lakers keep playing this way, Kobe should be ok with the minutes cuz there will be no playoffs for him..... I find it amusing even though it won't last that the Lakers are in the basement..... It keep Lakers fans complaining constantly and that is humorous to me :)
Mac271::you're a really dumb guy
Kaluroso::Same old, sad Lakers with Kobe point $@%!$@% his way to 40. Doomed!
Mac271::averaging over 61% FG moron.
johnnydhow22::Go Lakers! Keep that 0-fer streak going!
shawman66::The dwight effect. Game 3
mjsanders::Hmm, I guess this is what happens when you puts all your eggs in a senior citizen basket!  No chemistry on either end of the floor, Nash already gonna miss gms &amp; everybody callin for the HC’s head!  It’s comical how so many so-called hoops fans really thought that puttin these 4 guys together was like an instant chip recipe!  What gets me is that the Fakers have lost each gm differently.  1st gm Pau &amp; KB were solid, D12 was ok (except for the FTs) 7 Nash was terrible.  2nd gm D12 &amp; KB killed it, but Nash &amp; Pau were no-shows.  Then last night was like a flashback to the last 2 seasons!  KB was @ his ballhoggin best, while the twin towers took 7 LESS FGAs than him!    If this team was able to keep Bynum, get CP3 &amp; then add a Josh Smith, they’d be balanced, YOUNG &amp; would most likely have a better bench.   I know Faker Nation can’t wait for Stern to step down!

bullterrier1349::i guess memphis and the lakers are weak teams. smh.
JHAMM07::Im with you. This guy is crazy. If I remember right memphis and lakers were in the playoffs last year and the Clippers. How are you not sold? Now the bench is stacked as long as they stay healthy.
zaidi baraka::Come back Phil Jackson! We need you!!
F Scott Fitzgeralds Jumpshot::Throw in vanessa bryant and ill do it...maybe
Dont ban me Bro 4.0::I'm not a Laker fan, so I criticize objectively...  Mike Brown doesn't have a clue with the so-called Princeton offense.  Kobe needs to be more of a passer, Steve Nash needs to run more, and Howard needs to be able to hit outside shots for it to be a success.  None of that is going on because the players themselves don't fit into that system.
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::clippers fans are so adorable ... aww ...im not hatein just layin down some fact....dont be made clipper fans k ...u guys are awesome u got chris , griffen , odom, an jordan u guys are like the best team right now my hate to u .....to cute:)
JHAMM07::I think your just mad cause the Lakers spend too much money to suck. Yea you have history, but the staples center is the Clippers now.
bullterrier1349::learn how to spell before u comment. is that too much to ask? lol
F Scott Fitzgeralds Jumpshot::Lakers are better than ur team is lakerfresh in disguise. What an idiot
Lakers are better than your team::no!
F Scott Fitzgeralds Jumpshot::Nahh i leave tht to your granny ;)
Lakers are better than your team::screw you
F Scott Fitzgeralds Jumpshot::Lmao yea
Lakers are better than your team::Idiot Trolls. Lakers will win the chapionship
rebels52421::Damn dude you can't even spell "championship" - get the @#*$ on.
Thedevil25::You know what's even funnier.  Idiot Laker fans who think they will win the championship.
Mac271::you know what's funny? your goofy looking face
JHAMM07::Sounds like the lakers fans have big hopes and dreams. Get used to losing to the Clippers! You cant defend us.
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::aww see another clipper wit big hopes an dreams ...to cute :)
Lakers are better than your team::shut up
F Scott Fitzgeralds Jumpshot::Lmfao what did i miss last night? What did lakerfresh say ;)
just let your soul glow::The Lakers now are 2nd fiddle to the Clippers.
JHAMM07::do you know how to talk??
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::lol dont be made bro lol i got to huh ...knew just by sounding like a typical laker fan was gonna get under skinned lol what a re .....anyways u dont have to call me im no just a fan that thinks realistic. whos ur team ...r u a heat fan lol....i cant believe ur so easily irritated that says alot. lol u made my day thank u
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::what have clipper or clipper fans changed or offered to its viewers an nba ...other then blake griffen ????idk ...i wanna say chris paul but i like to be realistic i dont see him givin the clips a ring i see us pickin him up when hes nash age an goin for another ring lol
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::im happy u guys one a game ..u need it
relinquishy::won*
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::what have the clippers contribute ??? what ????....clippers fan - ooo well clippers fan always play hard we always give 110 % that why i could never be a clippers fan ...u guys win one game so what ...u have nothing to show for it ....just a bunch of laker rejects
Thedevil25::I'm a fan of neither.  I'm asking you moron, why do people have to call you?  Who the hell are you?  where you on the court with Shaq and Kobe.  Or Magic and Worthy.  Please tell me.  Cause right now that's your only response towards anything.  Call me when you win a ring.  How about you suck it up and realize that your team isn't as good as everyone thought they were going to be.  Crap coach, no bench, and a player who just jacks up shot after shot.
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::call me when they have some rings lol what a joke
just let your soul glow::You are correct the Lakers are a joke,all hype no substance.
Thedevil25::why do they have to call you?  what the hell did you contribute?
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::clipper who???
just let your soul glow::You know the same LA Clippers that punk'd your Lakers in front of your pro Laker crowd.
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::everyone hella dub im not worried at all ..just give the ball to nash an let them mash together thats it ...the team hasent really played as a team until season opener started an u guys r so quick to judge an jump ship ...im a laker fan an i hate other laker fan for not being smart an loyal ..use common sense $@%!$
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::im not disagreeing wit at all i just know just like in anything in life its gonna some time ....i dont have unrealistic standards like all other lakers there not young like the heat so that lil run they did a year or two ago isnt gonna happend to the laks ....so just aslong as we get to the playoffs we good an now that harden gone from okc r chance i assume look much better again im a realist
Thedevil25::How can you give the ball to a player who's hurt?  Needless to say that his backup was god awful last night.  The starting 5 at some point might get it together, but who in the hell do you have coming off the bench that can actually contribute something.  Seriously.  The Lakers bench is a Joke.
KentuckyAlum2012::40 points and the Lakers still lost. Maybe if Kobe had more than one assist, they would've won.
relinquishy::And that's the mentality of a bandwagoner: they do not realize that Kobe shooting makes everyone around him worse
Brady4TW::Who needs assists when you're shooting 60%? Kobe should have shot more - not less.
DavidCdxy::This settles the Lebron vs Kobe arguments.  Lebron made the finals with Mike Brown.  Kobe can't even win a game with Mike Brown AND two other potential hall-of-famers.  Lebron all the way.
Mac271::yeah, the Lakers went winless last season. where do they find people this dumb?
OPL21stJS::hahaah you right bro!!!!  Lebron&gt;Kobe      by far.
Brady4TW::Doesn't settle anything. Lebron was young and approaching his prime. Kobe can still score, but he's old.
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::i like that excuse he was aprroaching his prime thats why he was winning awards for mvp  an wasent he blowing players or teams out of the water at that time ...even comin out of high school u just knew hes gonna be a problem
big_lo510slab@yahoo.com::dumb ..how old was kobe an how old was lebron ...east side teams r a joke ...everone know for the longest the west teams have harder schedule  an teams u the east cost hast what 1super supert team an thaTS miami ...get ur fact straight
RonElway::Fire the Lakers coach! That guys is a joke! Go Nuggets!
Mac271::the Nuggets? that team is a joke.
noodleman1286::For all you morons saying Kobe should coach get real he is a selfish call hog. Why would you want anyone running a team with a mentality like that? Oh because he can score 40 points,,,,,oh thats right with 1 assist....the guy is a joke, and the lakers are a joke
zaidi baraka::The only thing you got going for you is your hate for Kobe. Go crawl under a rock and stay there!
relinquishy::wow that one was original
Kinga1024::dude is shooting over 60% fromt he field and averaging 30 a game that is not very funny
Igetterdone::If di*cks fly, your mouth is the airport.
LedgendsContinue2012::The biggest mistake so far for the Lakers was allowing Kobe to play on his injured foot. Now it is worse, and he will be out at some point, the question is for how long. Can this team do without Kobe on the floor?
I prefer boxers over briefs::They're 0 - 11 WITH him!!!
Kinga1024::maybe without kobe theyll start winning
gorillaplus2000::Can they be any worse?
noodleman1286::Jordan&gt;Howard Griffin&gt;Gasol CP3&gt;Nash  Clippers&gt;Lakers. Deal with it,
noodleman1286::oh hes a selfish ball hog and a drama queen, so Id take just about anyone over him
Kinga1024::im trying to deal with it, but the name kobe bryant confuses me with yoru assesment
kobepac24::I also would like to respond to Mr. Bryants shut up fans rant. Alright we know lakers have a winning history and we've seen the team struggle even in the years when they won a title. But these first 3 games are down right embarrassing. A lost to a Dallas team without Dirk or Kaman and being out played by Brand and ol dude they just released ( i forget his name) to make way for Troy Murphy. The Portland game was a little better but could have played with a little more pride given our recent record up there. Then lastnight was no contest. Not pressing the panic button but damm can we get a little more spunk and pride going here.
Dodger_Bum1980::Lakers should get ? to coach?
krappie1010::Some elderly person so he can better relate to the players.
kobepac24::I like the way Brown is having to defend his offense to his critics by pointing out how they scored over a hundred in portland. Then last night they fail to hit that mark yet again. Then as for being this defensive guru, they couldn't hold a college team under a 100. This is a carbon copy of last season. As much as i would like them to fire Brown today a coaching change at this point wont make a difference. Also the bench is just as bad as last seasons team. I know at some point they will play better and get some wins. But it will be due to the star power and not being a good team. Good teams wins championships a handful of stars will only go so far. 2004 all over again however this time they may not even make the finals due to Browns poor coaching skills. Unless the Lakers start running and getting more fastbreaks they wont get far.
Mark12081959::Lakers fans bwahahahahahahaahahahahhaahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahaahhahahahahahahaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaahaahhahahahahahha
IR0NFists10::Lakers are bad, and they should feel bad
IR0NFists10::Lakers are a pay to win type team, they dont work anything out, they juts pay more to try and fix the problem...But they paid too much for old worn out parts that have little mileage left in them
Dodger_Bum1980::nash was the only senior acquisition....other than Jamison...we go Dwight and Kobe still plays like Kobe so please explain how there were bust moves
Tdavis2304::Wanna see James Harden go hard on both teams
Harden4MVP::He will. It's inevitable.
ClipsRunLA::Hill Jaminson Ebanks Meeks Blake  That's all i gotta say, PEACE
Tdavis2304::Meek cold tho nobody else
gt1master_ike::NoThanks2U_17 Yea 40 points but 1 assist and 6 TO's... One of the worst 40 point performance in NBA history  ===============  SO averaging 1.73 points per shot to get 40 is one of the worst performances in NBA history?  Kobe was the only one actually trying to be aggressive. The 6 turnovers and 1 assists are good but the scoring more than makes up for it even if you take away a 1 point for each turnover.
kobepac24::Whats good Ike?
Mark12081959::winning
Ustna2::I can't wait for my Clips to play the Spurs or someone that might challenge them... I know it's only been a couple games, but I am ready to see some competition.
kobepac24::LOL. ok fair enough. The way we look now i can take that. But lets see how it is the next time they meet.
Ustna2::mkay... you mean when our already unbeatable bench is completely healthy? LOL.
kobepac24::What up buddy. You hanging that game one series banner already?
Ustna2::uh...not really. It was only the Lakers.
lakers will be 2013 champs::okay, c u fake clippers fans  in january.
noodleman1286::Butthurt?
BoSoxNGPM::Laker fans are so phony.  They just show up at games to celebrity-hunt.
Tdavis2304::Why people have to be fake I'm not a fan of either team but u don't have to stick with 1 team for the rest of your life u can branch off to like other teams because of the players they get. Like heat or Knicks nobody would be fans if melo or wade wasn't there
lakers will be 2013 champs::lakers coach sucks. kobe should coach.
Harden4MVP::..
Tdavis2304::Kobe don't hold back if u messing up he will call u out he is like a coach
IR0NFists10::What do you think Kobe does? He yells at his team mates to pass him the ball, thats the only coaching he does
lakers will be 2013 champs::and the sad part is that its still better then what mike brown does.
Ustna2::LAC 105  LOL 95
lakers will be 2013 champs::starting line up for 2013 all star game west kobe, KD, cp3, dwight and love  east lebron, bynum, rose/d will, dwane, melo
Dodger_Bum1980::lame dude lopez
TeamJMack::It's "front court" players now not centers.
Dodger_Bum1980::take a chiill with bynum that dudes a has been....unfortunately hes highlights in his career have come to an end ala Oden...Lakers make players great LEGENDARY and this cat isnt great...hes good...
lakers will be 2013 champs::who do u predict instead of bynum
Spark032708::Yes they will, in the lottery
IR0NFists10::lol at your name, started drinking the kool aid way too early dude
Mark12081959::lakers will be 2013 champs - u watch in june man. we gona kick $@%.  from ur couches
lakers will be 2013 champs::u watch in june man. we gona kick $@%.
Spark032708::Let's get real here.  This team should have been gutted after they were swept by the Mavs in 2011.  They  are two years older now and two steps slower.  Memo to the Buss &amp; Kupchack,  cut your losses before this gets worse.  Mark my words, if the Lakers fail to make the playoffs this year Kobe will retire.  Dump the rest of the team and rebuild around DH, since he is still young.  Frankly, I would rather see younger, inexperienced and more athletic players sucking than the dough the Buss's shelled out for this garbage.  If they stay pat where they are now, no way they are winning a championship.
Spark032708::They will win if Mike Brown is gone by next week
Dodger_Bum1980::nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnah....theyll win thank you though
Spark032708::I agree Iron, he's a ball hog
Spark032708::Then I'll get to the point.  THE LAKERS SUCK A?S!!!!
IR0NFists10::The lakers needed to get rid of Kobe to be honest, his personality is a poison to the team
lakers will be 2013 champs::dude, no way in hell am i gona read something that long.
Dodger_Bum1980::dam Lakers lost again ....well atleast we dont have a player in Harden that has taken his talents and OKCs mojo to houston...or a team like the Heat that can lay down like a hooker for another teams pleasure like the Heat.......is it possible to win by losing, I think yes  ha ha ha
Dodger_Bum1980::nnnnnnnah....they lost it....there done...they lost there bench and spark player westbrook is by far more of a hog than Kobe ever was
Spark032708::How can you say that Dodger.  They haven't come close to winning a game so far.
Dodger_Bum1980::i can say that due to all the hate okc and heat fans spew...looking around the league it appears that Lakers are not as horrendous as people say they are....okc wont have another player step up and mask westbrooks selfishness...dont get me wrong...they ll be good...but wont win this year...YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST
IR0NFists10::I think OKC beat Portland who Lakers lost to...OKC still has its mojo with Westbrook and Durant, those trend setters
NoThanks2U_17::Yea 40 points but 1 assist and 6 TO's... One of the worst 40 point performance in NBA history
lakers will be 2013 champs::were u watching the game. he was passing a ton. assists require other players excellence and kobe was the only one doing anything out there. if kobe shoots well, then its perfectly fin for him to take as many shots as he wants. and with the ball to be in his hands that much, u would expect it to be turned over a couple of times.
Mark12081959::a ton -is that a unit of measure?
lakers will be 2013 champs::kobe is still the best player in la.
Mark12081959::he is the best in louisiana
Igetterdone::BTW Harden will be more Clutch than Lebron at the end of it all.
Harden4MVP::Relax Guy. They're both clutch. The ring speaks for itself. I like Harden as well, but Lebron deserves his respect. Dude is the truth.
lakers will be 2013 champs::lol, anyone is more clutch than lebron besides possibly javale mcgee
lakers will be 2013 champs::lebron fans cairing all about stats  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIAUycCR6QM
will.mebs::lebron actually has better crunch-time stats than kobe.....just sayin.
