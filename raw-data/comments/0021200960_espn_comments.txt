inquisitiveman::Kobe intentionally distracted Korver....karma?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRx1P8mSlr0
ncrdbl1::With all the fouls that Kobe has gotten away with through out his career. He is the last person to whine about someone else not getting called for a foul.  Who knows maybe Kobe raped the guys GF and he was upset about it. .
twopoorforu::no need to worry...lakers will prevail
bobcatsnumber1fan::100+MIL payroll, barley above .500, struggling to hold the 8th seed, promise to be 2013 champs = biggest bust in NBA history

inquisitiveman::barry bonds says  to call him so that he rub some cream on that ankle..
jcsurfshop@yahoo.com::Deer antler spray isn't banned.

Mambaholic 33::11-33 = Pathetic
bobcatsnumber1fan::KOBRICK
SjGMEN77::This is a good time for the Mavericks to pass the Jazz and Lakers to make the 8th seed.
Le Brick::Mike Bresnahan says "NBA expected to send out a release in which it says a foul should have been called and two shots awarded on the Kobe-Dahntay Jones play"
polocash::And that several other misses against LA should have been called earlier in game. They canceled each other out since both teams might have scored more pts.
James Bond 1001::paul pierce &gt; kobe
jcsurfshop@yahoo.com::Yeah, in sucking a mans junk.
Le Brick::*Paul Pierce + Wheel Chair &gt; Kobe
James Bond 1001::pp &gt; lebron&gt; durant &gt; kobe
Le Brick::Where's "Retro Lakers" at???  I'm here to accept his apology.
lakersfann1990::That was a damn foul and no call as usual.
KatelynFabersLawyer211::WOW.....
James Bond 1001::spurs suck
Mark12081959::ouch the sand in my vag hurts  grey mamba
L.A Fakers::Kobe is a loser
Le Brick::He's actually a winner:  5 NBA Championships and 2 Olympic Gold Medals.
oneandonlybabe::What  are the chances Kobe plays next game?
Scottpilgrim32::-0%
Get your foot off the boat::LBJ sent over to Kobe a couple pairs of Lebron X's....  Wear some high tops, fool.
Scottpilgrim32::"Ow Dahntay gave me a booboo. I can't believe he try to play defense on me and cause he to hurt myself. wahhhhhhhhhhh Refs you were suppose to protect me till death do we part"  Kobe Bryant
NASH_10::Both teams looked dead tired in the 4th last night. Antoni proved he is not coaching this team, when in the entire 4th, he didn't draw up a single offensive play to get someone the ball other than Kobe. So it will be much easier to fire him at the end of this season to make way for the one guy who should have been given the job in the first place. A guy who knows how to use 2 big men - the most dominant big + the most skilled big .:.
ThrowsTheHammerDown::So much for the playoffs

Get your foot off the boat::Kobe will sit on Friday since there is no chance for LA to beat the Pacers in Indiana anyway (with or without him).  Then he'll come back against the lowly Kings to show he's still the man.....
CarlyJoni::And lose to the Suns the next night after a back to back.  Lakers have no stamina on back to backs.  Haven't won one yet.
Bill GOAT potus::Kobe will play, that is why god invented HGH.
L.A Fakers::Once again, that's not anything to brag about. Barely above .500 still sucks
lakersfann1990::thats all that matters
Get your foot off the boat::Good for you.  Lakers are the first team so far to meet its pre-season goal of playing .500 ball with a $100+ million payroll.  Congratulations.
lakersfann1990::we still over .500
Bill GOAT potus::Over .500 does not get a playoff spot. This was an opportunity lost. They need to beat IND to save the trip.
miami360x::Now he has his excuse ready for not making the playoffs.
Bill GOAT potus::Kobe shot them out of, then into, then out of this game. That has been his probelm for years. If he never had a run like he had in this game (19 pts in a qtr) then he would never have a run like he had in this game (0 for the entire 1st qtr). But did you see the fans when Kobe had his run. I would be embarassed to be a Hawks fan.
L.A Fakers::If your teams loses the game, then you don't run the board. Everyone else does. And this is claimed by the Lakers Haters board
miami360x::I don't hate the Lakers, just Kobe.
digimon.emperor::i feel bad for lakersfann1990 he has to deal with all the comments that we say like lakers suck
Get your foot off the boat::It's a toss up on who is going to cry first...  Sandycrotchinla  or  Lakersfann1990
Scottpilgrim32::where's lakersfann1990? Boy be talkin mess for the past week.
miami360x::Kobe's mad cause he got injured trying to flop, so he's calling it a dirty play.

digimon.emperor::TO SOUTH BEACH WE GO  - lakers fans after kobe is injured
L.A Fakers::Lakers fans don't deserve their own board. Especially when they suck all the time
digimon.emperor::i dont like lebron lol he is the best in the league right now though
lakersfann1990::we like kobe you clowns like lebron so go to the heat board
Mark12081959::u have his balls in ur mouth
L.A Fakers::I have a job. I have to fill Kobe's locker with tampons before each game.
lakersfann1990::Lebron is trash
miami360x::Honestly you have no brain.
digimon.emperor::honestly lakers and heat fans are all bandwagoners
L.A Fakers::"They inflated the ball too much this season. It's as hard as the bricks i throw." Kobe Bryant
L.A Fakers::I have a job, I fill Kobe's locker with tampons before each game
SandyBeachesinla::Keep your day job.. Tool

SandyBeachesinla::You are a Lowlife $@%
lakersfann1990::If we are so delusional why do you clowns spend constant hours on our board?
L.A Fakers::Lakers are a joke and don't deserve a board so it's open to real fans of real teams
lakersfann1990::Laker fans can be on this board look at the teams you "Fool"  the heat board is the other way.
Lakers 2013 Champs::I actually enjoy being a fake lakers fan.  My username is so ridiculous but yet...people agree.
Lakers 2013 Champs::the reaction from Lakers fans to dumb post is amazing.  it's pure entertainment.
L.A Fakers::Your in the board too idiot
Mark12081959::how do u get in a board?
Delusional Lakers Fan::To have fun with you :)
L.A Fakers::"Am i supposed to have a dick? because I don't" - Kobe Bryant
lakersfann1990::Katelynfaberlawyer211-  Jerry West &gt;&gt; Kobe  Kobe is the greatest laker ever .
L.A Fakers::Spurs &gt; Lakers
Mark12081959::western conf &gt; Fakers
KatelynFabersLawyer211::Because I appreciate history, and Kobe's legacy doesn't stand up to Magic's, Kareem's, or West's.
lakersfann1990::Why do you care your'e a spurs fan.
KatelynFabersLawyer211::HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAA!!! You, sir, are an EPIC comedian!!!!
Lakers 2013 Champs::I'm a fake Lakers fan.  I post nonsense.....and I am constantly surprised at the level of ignorance when it comes to Lakers fans who agree with my posts.
iwentpp::I must agree.  Lakers fans are pretty delusional.
lakersfann1990::Wow
Delusional Lakers Fan::Me too!  <b>They don't even read my username lol.</b>
KatelynFabersLawyer211::Jerry West &gt;&gt; Kobe
Get your foot off the boat::Mae West, Adam West  or Kayne West &gt; Kobe
L.A Fakers::Lebron dosnt lead the league in turnovers but Kobe Does. Lebron &gt; Kobrick
L.A Fakers::" Kobe is better than Everyone." Delusional crack addicted lakers fans
Delusional Lakers Fan::We're not Delusional.  (nevermind my username)
lakersfann1990::Kobe is by far better then Lebron its no comparison  "5 beats 1 everytime".
Delusional Lakers Fan::EXACTLY!  Kobe scored more than Lebron  (shot attempts doesn't matter)
Get your foot off the boat::Kobe is as good as Steve Kerr  5 = 5 every time.
L.A Fakers::Lebron &gt; Kobe every day
L.A Fakers::"An Pippen is better than Kobe. 6 beats 5 every time"
Get your foot off the boat::LA is 13-24 against teams above .500....plus they suck on the road...  Why is last night's loss so surprising?
Lakers 2013 Champs::L.A Fakers is saying that Lebron is the best player in the NBA?  LOL.    Put Lebron on the Lakers and they won't even make the playoffs.  Put Kobe on the Heat and they win 6 more championships.  Kobe can take Jordan 1 on 1 EASILY.  You can't debate that.
L.A Fakers::Lol biggest idiots alive are Lakers fans. LEBRON CRUSHES Kobe every time they play!!
Delusional Lakers Fan::This Lakers team can beat the 90's Bulls and both the Magic Lakers Team or Bird Celtic Team.
Lakers 2013 Champs::Lakers fans based their opinion on FACTS.  Do you really think Lebron is even in the top 10 in the NBA right now?  You're delusional.
Get your foot off the boat::Video is misleading.
Delusional Lakers Fan::I agree.  Jordan is like 50 years old
lakersfann1990::I agree but im just a bit concerned on what the lakers offensive scheme will be now.
Delusional Lakers Fan::Lakers don't need offense.
lakersfann1990::Lakers 2013 champs-  then you're not a true lakers fan.  Its a team sport why not blame the whole team for the loss ??    Like I said I blame everybody lakers started off slow no energy they took for granted josh smith, Lou Williams,  Pachulia,  and jeff teague were out It was a trap game.
lakersfann1990::It was a trap game I didnt intend to say crap
KatelynFabersLawyer211::The Laker$ are 12-and-21 on the road; they shouldn't treat ANY game as a "trap game".
Get your foot off the boat::You spelled "crap" wrong.
DUDE-I-TOLD-YOU::BREAKING NEWS! :  Kobe was spotted in Phoenix, attending the trial of Jodi Arias.  A source close to the defendant states she and Kobe had an on-going relationship.  Kobe wouldn't comment but did mention he thought Arias was innocent, adding:  "...they're out to get her...I've seen this a million times.   Atleast she wasn't Jalen'd..."  -TmZSPN
L.A Fakers::"The Lakers suck." - Charlotte Bobcats
L.A Fakers::Because you play teams like the bobcats and magic and other crappy teams all the time. Against real playoff teams, you can't win
Get your foot off the boat::It's about time for the "16 'ships and 5 ringz" post.....
nvorod24::for now...lol
Lakers 2013 Champs::What are you....12?  Lakers can beat the Bobcats any day of the week.  This year you're going to watch Lakers make history once again.  Sweeping both OKC and Miami in the playoffs.  This team is unstoppable.  4 Hall of Famers will NOT lose in the Finals.  That's for sure.
lakersfann1990::at least we over .500
lakersfann1990::Lakers 2013 champs-   You can't blame Kobe for last night's loss. You guys keep blaming his shooting % (11 for 33) but what you need to blame it on is Howard. Seriously, Howard needs to go. Kobe is the best player on the planet right now and we need to give him more shots. 10 more shots attempts and he would easily have 50 points.     Nobody is going to beat the Lakers when Kobe scores 50 each night. Simple as that. I blame everybody nobody was making sh*t.
L.A Fakers::Your both idiots
Lakers 2013 Champs::then you're not a true lakers fan.
Lakers 2013 Champs::<b>You can't blame Kobe for last night's loss.</b>  You guys keep blaming his shooting % (11 for 33) but what you need to blame one person:   Howard.

Nobody is going to beat the Lakers when Kobe scores 50 each night.  Simple as that.
L.A Fakers::Lol your a such a MORON. LEBRON is the best on the planet and 2nd is Durant. Kobe is not that great.
Get your foot off the boat::10 more shots would have gotten Kobe to 40 points....he would have needed 20 more shots to get to 50...
KatelynFabersLawyer211::Now the Laker$ can actually flourish as a team.
lakersfann1990::Your'e a spurs fan they play tonight
KatelynFabersLawyer211::These boards belong to me. There's no reason for me to leave.
lakersfann1990::Ok now you can leave since you wont have kobe to talk about all day
L.A Fakers::"That was a dirty play." - Metta Wold Peace
