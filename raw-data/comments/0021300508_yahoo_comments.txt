Cyril::I'm just curious why some Wizards fans hate Trevor Booker so much. His stats as a starter are 9 points and 9 rebounds on 56% shooting in 28 minutes.  That's pretty close to what Kenneth Faried gave the Nuggets last year (11.5 points, 9 rebounds, 55%, 28 minutes).  The only big difference is that Faried goes to the free-throw line more. Booker is actually a better jump shooter.   He doesn't take a lot of shots, and he makes most of the ones he does take. He doesn't commit many turnovers, and he plays decent defense. He did a great job on Nowitzki a few games back and ended that game with 19 rebounds too. Ariza and Beal were a combined 7-for-27 in that game.   Booker's not an All-Star, but he's one heck of a role player.  He certainly doesn't "suck."
Justin::Jordan has that young wife, cares NOTHING for the Hornets (Bobcats).  It's just another to his collection (EGO).  Charlotte would do well if Jordan were NOT the owner.
Alex::Gerald Henderson is running this offense right now. He can't miss!
PKM::Ariza and Beal need to step up.
Ian::Ariza needs to start playing like he has a far bigger offensive role, and is more important to the team than Trevor Booker because.....well......Booker sucks.  He shouldn't be taking over 15 shots, ever.  Ariza should.  Time for Ariza to "put his big-boy pants on".
HeyHoody::The Wiz starters played about 150 minutes, yet they turned the ball over  1 -- one! -- time.  Nicely done, Wiz.
Michael Williams::Lets Go Bobcats. Should be a good game. We need to get back to playing defense again, if we can do that we can hang with any team.
Jamie::Is Booker starting tonight?
Dave H::Come on Bobcats, these guys have been playing better. Going to have to play hard the whole game
Dave H::Bobcats look like they need to make a trade or two! They got some players to work a trade, that could help this team get better. seem to be settling to much for outside shots right now.
