Devinhuelsmann::What won the game for the Jazz: FT's: Jazz: 32-46 70%  Pelicans: 17-28 60%
.cha cha cha chia-::when you have ryan anderson guarding paul millsap what do you expect
Devinhuelsmann::I dont like to see Vasquez shooting 8-21. hes kinda turning into a Westbrook. but the assist are still there. so cut down on the shots and he would be a very solid player
ensign.devyn::If he had made 2 more shots and gone 10/21, nothing would have been said
nirvanarox67::Been following a betting system called sportsbettingstar. Ive made around $3000 a month average since I started to use this systems bets. You will find the system on google simply by searching for sports betting systems
scow79::Great trade by Detroit today.  Realizing what an asset a pass oriented PnR PG would mean for Drummond and Monroe's future development.  That and they just dumped salary so they'll now be competing with the Jazz in free agency.
steeleute::I would love for the jazz to go after Vasquez
Rip City Forever::The puh puh puh pelicans the New Orleans puh luh kins hahahaha
scow79::I also just listened to the beginning of Locke's podcast and he said that he thought the Jazz were going to have to keep Al Jefferson next year because he didn't know how we score at the end of games without him.  Locke is a mouthpiece for the organization.   I don't remember the rest of the podcast because I think I fainted at that point.
vergatease::I like Locke he's a good stats guy and I'm pretty sure he isn't from Utah.
Darkflame07::So hot rod was a pretty terrible play by play guy huh? Must have been because If you end up in Utah you apparantley must be terrible. Locke is anything but a company man. He got fired from Seattle because he thought it was BS they were selling the team an let them know it. I listen to hi podcast every day an nobody wants favors on te floor more than him but especially after games like last night he doesn't know how to take Paul off the floor and give his minutes to favors. I don't agree with him all the time either, but at least he backs up all of his claims with numbers and evidence and you can always see his side of the argument.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I don't live in Utah, as the regulars know. I never have to hear him or any other clowns, but truth is, if you're a broadcaster and you ended up in Utah, it's usually because you aren't any good at it.
caseygreer2::I stopped following locke on twitter and stopped listening to his podcasts, and my life has been so much better ever since. I frequent SLCdunk now, and it's much more enjoyable.
scow79::His podcast is decent and he does provide some good insight on occasion, but it's obvious he's a company man.  He's also a bit condescending to fans and their desires to have the young guys play which bothers me since I'm a "play the young guys" type of fan.  It's a good listen if you a.) Have to drive to work or b.) in my case walk your poop machine of a dog twice a day, or c.)  there are no BS Report's to listen to.  I'm just hoping his comments aren't trying to prepare the fanbase for the eventual re-signing of Big Al.  I don't know if I can watch 4 more years of this.
scow79::“Yeah, but it’s not our young guys that need to step up. It’s our veterans and guys been in the league for three, four years. They aren’t moving their feet. They aren’t playing defense. I’m not interested in fake numbers. Yeah, you can go up there and put up 25 points or 15 assists, but if you aren’t playing defense you aren’t helping.”  - Monty Williams  He's like the Bizarro Corbin
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I have never seen Al Jefferson get in a defensive position.
steeleute::Yes Tremors, Big Al is one lazy b@stard, and what makes me mad is he chooses to not play defense because I have seen him block shots in games and be defensive because he has the talent to be a good defender  but 95% of the time he chooses not to
pclarkbassman::I own the tremors movie pack. Graboids for life!
dahojas::I'm tired of Kanter not getting minutes. His potential is so freaking high. He needs to have minutes so he can develop.
caseygreer2::Anybody whose ever watched a jazz game knows this.....
van.muhle::Anyone notice that its usually either Kanter or Favors that dominates in a game but rarely both, and the other one that isn't lighting it up usually gets to ride pine
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=agfx8rv  If Jefferson and/or Millsap would sign a FA waiver, I don't think I'm crazy to still think this is possible.
scow79::I still think Kemba is untouchable.  I also think you underestimate Corbin's love for veterans.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::If that's true, then they should just let Millsap and Jefferson walk and enjoy the $23.5 in cap space.
van.muhle::Taking on Gordans contract for an extra year would be tough and Thomas has really lost a lot of his luster, they might go for it, but I actually think the Bucks or maybe the Pistons might be our most willing trade partners right now.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I don't, so we'll agree to disagree there. It's not that I underestimate it. I've seen it in full force, but I'm saying if Miller, KOC and the Milk Man all sit down and decide that's the direction the team is going, then it would be reflected on the court, or then Corbin might get the axe.
scow79::Who would get the time at the two?   Ben Gordon is supposedly just as good at shooting the 3 and supposedly just as bad at playing defense as Foye is.   It might cause Corbin's head to explode.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Gordon is brought in solely for motivation for Charlotte to do it. He's a decent player, but wildly overpaid at $12.4 million. Jazz could afford to take it on, because it expires right when the first pair of young guys need to get paid. Same with Thomas the following year. If the decision was made to do something like this, I think that's putting all the chips in the young guys, so Foye or Gordon would come off the bench.

Real_Salt Lake::Go Suns! :)
Ryd3rr::Oh right lol, who doesn't! ha ha
Wombat1247::Yeh - well done Suns - Good Win
Real_Salt Lake::nah I just want the lakers to lose
Ryd3rr::Wrong room bud lol
van.muhle::watched Gangster Squad tonight,  the best way to describe that movie is a movie that makes you laugh out loud during its most "intense"  and serious moments, some pretty good one liners though...
Ryd3rr::Oh really? You don't rate it?
Ryd3rr::Django it is :)
van.muhle::Django and Zero dark thirty were both watch it on the big screen though, two very different movies though.
Ryd3rr::haha! Awesome thanks mate, you saved me a movie ticket. Was going to go see it tonight. . . Dvd it is :) lol
van.muhle::My rating goes like this :  Pay full admission at a regular theatre  Pay to see it at a dollar theatre   Rent it  Recommend it to your mother in law.  its a rent it
free derrick favors::Only enjoyment I get out of these games is the 10 minutes when Kanter Favors and Hayward are all playing together. Most boring Jazz team ever
dishnetkid::lol when was that?  I though it was AK-47
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::When AK was injured.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Most boring? I remember a time when Matt Harpring was the "Go to" guy.
caseygreer2::AK was on that team, that was fun. Love me some AK
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Anyone see the video of Lebron tackling the fan in celebration after he hit a half-court shot for $75K? Pretty funny.
recnepsbaby::Good video!
Ryd3rr::I like Lebron, he's so laid back! Good Video!
recnepsbaby::Good Video!
JuMueller::By the way this game's sidewager was for who gets to be the Jazz  next season...  sorry pelican scrubs
Ryd3rr::Pretty sure I sleep through that whole game with my eyes open. Woeful
van.muhle::Anyone secretly wishing the team takes a tumble, we trade Jefferson and Millsap, and Corbin gets the ax? The more hollow wins and early playoff exits we get the more it feels like we are just delaying the inevitable...
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I don't want the tumble and don't think the Corbin firing is necessary at this point.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::It's easy to be an armchair coach. Hell, I could coach this very Jazz team to 82-0 in my head. The reason so many teams sit in the sh¡tter for so long is because of the revolving door for the coach's chair.
van.muhle::Honestly, truth be told Im not sure the book is out on Corbin yet, maybe he needs a team that is really "his".  His rotations can be frustrating as hell though.
free derrick favors::I thought I was the only one lol
jbarson13::I don't just want to see Corbin get kicked out of the door, I want to see KOC go with him, too.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Yeah, I don't buy this at all. KOC FTW
jbarson13::He's perfectly content with mediocrity. In the last year, he's said no to proposed trades involving Kevin Love and Rajon Rondo. And he's not allowing Dennis Lindsay to make any moves. It's time to move on.
AceyUT::where is the proposed trade for kevin love..  minnesota wouldnt move him if their life depended on it.
van.muhle::KOC has acutally been on of the best and most well respected GM's around the league for years, dude never really gets enough credit.   He's not perfect by any means though.
UKFTW13::GOOD JOB GOOD EFFORT PELICANS
free derrick favors::Hell even Kwame brown could score 20 if the ball was in his hands 80% of the game
Kevin65478::play anthony davis 22 minutes and wonder why you lost???
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Play Favors 23 and wonder how you won?
rbmw263::Did Favors just say we played like balls last game?? ha ha
van.muhle::Balls would be putting it nicely, unless those are the same balls that are found in Richard Simmons purse...
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::They'd be covered in duck butter.
rbmw263::or the balls of a 500 lb man after he has walked 3 miles in 110 degree heat
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Did Favors just say, "We played like balls" regarding the Houston debacle?
rbmw263::beat me to it
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I sure did.
ballerbooboo::2 nights in a row vasq. goes for a two....last night he pass it up so lopez make the shot for the cover
van.muhle::I hear Pelicans are a ferocious bird, Hornets fans speak up, is this true? Are Pelicans actually a "mean" bird?
steeleute::Good find on the video Saints Fan91
steeleute::Ha ha thats awesome, I take back all my negative comments about Pelicans
Saints Fan91::You be the judge   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNNl_uWmQXE
UKFTW13::Holy crap...
VikomnLA::I think when the Hornets lose, they make sure they cover the spread.
VikomnLA::I am betting the pelicans the next time they play, because I don't think this is a fluke that they back door cover with nothing on the line.  I think the team knows the line and makes sure they cover it. It made no sense for a layup with 7 seconds left and down by 7.
vergatease::NBA IS RIGGED
ballerbooboo::i bet he know the spread...LOL
ballerbooboo::all by vasq....he made a layup last night he passed to lopez ...seem fishy ahha
VikomnLA::i know
VikomnLA::that is twice in 2 nights, that the hornets have back door covered,
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::1. A big man who plays 34 minutes, scores 22, only gets 5 rebound and is a -10 2. A big man who plays 23 minutes, scores 15, gets 6 rebounds and it a +9  I'll take 15 points and +9 over 22 points and a -10 every game.
leif65::the jazz are missing hayward which sucks
Eric Forman.::I like that I can look at the Hornets roster and recognize a number of players from college the past few years (Davis, Lopez, Vasquez, Rivers, Thomas). I hope they can materialize into a contender in the next few years.
jpks11x::Thanks for the free basket... what a way to cover wow
jpks11x::CMON PLZ BRICK A FT!
free derrick favors::Now I got to hear the Delusional Jazz fans say "oh we coundn't score without jefferson he was so clutch." Look at this +/-. Oh and we had a 10 point lead thanks to favors defense. Winning by 6 at home is nothing impressive
Mojazz::I'd like to see Al Jefferson at PF next to Favors at C.  They complement each other on offense, and Al could guard the slowest big on defense.
Grantox::if jefferson would play some D and not go into iso mode when he touches the ball id like him
capnchuc::http://www.nba.com/statistics/plusminus/plusminus_sort.jsp?pcomb=1&amp;season=22012&amp;split=9&amp;team=Jazz  At least he is consistently negative
Grantox::only reason favors is negative is cause he plays with jefferson a lot
jpks11x::RYNO FOR THE COVER WOW
Grantox::this is when hjazz need hayward!
KeGar986::damn vasquez has got to be the worst pg at clock management
lllllll llll::New Orleans Jazz Salt Lakers Los Angeles Red Carpets
jason21382::Pelican is growing on me... ah
didyougetthememookur::Pistol Pelican Pete is the mascot.
jason21382::gotta go
Grantox::i cant say i agree
jason21382::the name is
capnchuc::Good game Hornet fans, the Jazz won but I feel angry inside
jpks11x::please just one bucket hornets..
Grantox::gg pelicans fans i like you guys ! looking forward to the next one!
didyougetthememookur::Houston looks like they're going to lose to, so I guess that's good.
free derrick favors::LOL -10 sums up Jefferson as a player
jpks11x::YES AND HORNETS COVER!
jpks11x::please brick on randy
nin10do1::Good game Jazz fans
SAINTS_LSU_HORNETS89::wow that was a terrible brick
jpks11x::Lmao fkin hornets

free derrick favors::$@%! now the Jazz management is going to think Jefferson won this game
