wade.stole.my.wheelchair::WERE ARE ALL THE HEAT SLURPERS
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::still cant understand how you can be world champs and have a few thousand empty seats.. heat FANS are PATHETIC
Pmay2012::Saving the money to attend the finals...
DOOFY ONE::DRAYMOND!
spartyon 12::don't leave DayDay in the corner
cbbaseball19::Alright Im outta here.  people are putting me in a shi.tty mood. (work related)  Take it easy everyone!
Aicyla22::bye! im heading out too freedom is calling.  have a good evening everyone.  GO HEAT!

Djuki 3::yes we know, the warriors won, congratulations!
Bamm7272::The Heat are devastated by a December regular season loss!
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::we are talking basketball here folks
Bamm7272::somehow you just reminded me of the line: "Stupid is as stupid does".
MiamiFan2004::Says the guy that claims Wade is not in the Top ten in SGs in the East.  You are talking lies and trash, WE are talking basketball, troll.
Aicyla22::hes also been talking about, shoes, fans, and match.com
Djuki 3::no, you are trolling my friend, your name explains it all
Aicyla22::aw come on guys give him some credit hes trying really hard ahahahaha
Bamm7272::He's really stretching here....
Djuki 3::what does my photo have to do with anything?
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::see photo* and you calling me a troll. LMAO
SportsFan9835::Wade is averaging a nice game stats wise but overall he doesnt seem to want it as much as he used to. Lebron cant completely carry this team the whole season.
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::whens the last time you saw wade play a FULL or even close to full 82 game season..
Aicyla22::what does that have to do with anything? hes injury prone if he needs to be rested he needs to be rested
Djuki 3::i played all 82 games with him in 2K13
Djuki 3::Wade looks a bit older and banged up
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::dubs record VS heat and wizards this year 2-0  heat record VS warriors and wizards this year 0-2
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::ENJOY DEFENDING YOUR *... ITS BACK TO NORMAL 82 GAMES THIS YEAR
MiamiFan2004::nba is worst, is that YOU?  Geez, new name, same old lies.  LOL!
Djuki 3::p.s anyone who says dubs sounds like a d.ouche
DOOFY ONE::the dubs is their nickname... only $@%!$@ here is you.
Aicyla22::lol! is he trying to insult you? thats cute
Djuki 3::talk pick up moves?
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::any one who puts there photo on here trying to look hard and talk pick up moves on a espn basketball site sounds like someone who should spend more time on match.com or something
Aicyla22::sounds like or is?
Aicyla22::defending champs this year, not wizards or warriors
cbbaseball19::Aicyla22 that only applies to old women -------------------------------- Haha touche.
Aicyla22::its true though for future reference
cbbaseball19::hahahaha scared me there for a second!
Aicyla22::jk i dont care im asian ill look 22 forever
Aicyla22::youre pushing your luck now!!
cbbaseball19::Oh boy so good thing we found out your age already :-P
Aicyla22::i would say under 30
Djuki 3::just make sure she looks over 18
cbbaseball19::ok next time I ask a younger female her age and I get attacked im blaming you!
Djuki 3::what's the cutoff age?
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::bay area fans &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;heat fans
MiamiFan2004::By weight?  Yes. By IQ?  No.
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::that home attendace stuff is B.S. and you know it.. watch the games . why pay for seats if your not going to go.. just PATHETIC FANS
Bamm7272::when you come to Miami, you'll understand
Aicyla22::its a business
Bamm7272::http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance  Miami 101.1% home attendance, 95.6% for away games Golden State: 94.8% home attendance, 88.6% for away games.  People want to see the Heat, the Warriors - not so much
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::see* spurs game too. just PATHETIC BANDWAGON FANS
Aicyla22::that game was also sold out when ppl found out it was the bench playing they didnt go theres A LOT of better things to do in south florida
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::by the looks of all the empty seats at heat home games. my eyes dont lie , thousands of empty seats. go to warrior game anytime even if we are in last place we still fill the seats, you guys are world champs and its just PATHETIC to see all those chairs empty..
Djuki 3::they're old and have prostate problems, the seats weren't empty, the fans were just in the bathroom for long periods of time
Aicyla22::its bc no one wants to see the warriors play
Bamm7272::according to? you?
Djuki 3::how would you even measure that?
Aicyla22::i love google
cbbaseball19::YES!
Aicyla22::http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/226/d/a/I__m_a_Stupid_Fox_by_Termi92.jpg

Djuki 3::haha well played ;)
Aicyla22::in stupidity
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::barkley was right wade does look old an slow. maybe he shoulda satayed with jordan shoes instead of selling out to chinese shoe co....
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::my warriors are fine and ulike 99% of miami fans i'm sticking by my raiders...
Bamm7272::satayed, ulike.  Are you in the new word creation department?
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::kobe in his 17th season&gt; wade in his prime   besides if not for joey crawford (06 finals) he'd only have *1
Bamm7272::Kobe is dong a great job of leading his team....  to a #12 seed in the West.
Djuki 3::how about them Raiders?
cbbaseball19::stayed*
Bamm7272::yep. my first thought was chicken.
Djuki 3::i like satayed, he's cooking something
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::yes the same guy who will go on injured reserve for two weeks with dry skin.. that d.fade
Bamm7272::you inspire so much credibility....
Bamm7272::You mean the two time NBA champ, # 1 SG in the East averaging 20 points per game?
Djuki 3::remember the days of rookie Wade and fit Odom?  they made the playoffs and everyone was rooting for the under-dog miami.  now everyone hates them =/
Djuki 3::haha in that case i was 6 in 88
Djuki 3::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3H77gIpYi8
Djuki 3::sad for Wade i meant, he sparked back the HEat to relativity
Aicyla22::hey thers nothing to be sad about with pat at the helm
Djuki 3::yeah, kinda makes me sad =/
Aicyla22::aw young wade he sure cant play like that anymore although hes still got it in him sometimes
Aicyla22::nevermind u beat me
Djuki 3::my favorite moment was when D-Wade POSTERIZED Jermaine O' Neil.  his stupid face was priceless!
Djuki 3::right below =P
Aicyla22::link?
Aicyla22::when did u become a heat fan?
Aicyla22::that only applies to old women
cbbaseball19::Exactly. What Duro said!
Djuki 3::not polite to ask a woman her age
Djuki 3::haha in that case, i was 6 in 88
Bamm7272::I started FIU that year. Little new Freshman....
Aicyla22::lol you could have asked me my age if u wanted to know
cbbaseball19::She revealed her age!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aicyla22::oh yes you beat us i was 4 in 88
Djuki 3::lol well i guess you beat us all
Bamm7272::I went to a few games in the now demolished Miami Arena back in '88. Now that's old!
cbbaseball19::Shhhhhhhhhh! Im almost 23!
Aicyla22::aw youre a baby
Djuki 3::lol really? oh wow i feel old
cbbaseball19::I was born in 90 lol
Djuki 3::that was when they let the boys actually play, no ticky tack fouls, just hard nosed basketball.  that was when the Heat Knicks rivalry was at its best
Aicyla22::i liked dan majerle and timmy with the fade away jumpers
Aicyla22::that sucks cb those were the days i loved 90's basketball
Djuki 3::i love Wade and Bron but there was nothing I loved more than watching ZO just swat shots left and right!
cbbaseball19::I was a youngin lol
Aicyla22::same here
Djuki 3::90's when ZO and Timmay were playing
cbbaseball19::I remember those days!
Aicyla22::its so weird to see old pics of wade he looks soooo much older now lebron on the other hand has looked 40 since he was 16
Djuki 3::yeah that's true, Wade was once a young buck
cbbaseball19::RunTheBall22__ - you win this round aicyla but this is not the end of runtheball. i will be back ------------------------------------  We are saving this!
Djuki 3::haha well done!
Aicyla22::i cant take all the credit though. google lent a helping hand
cbbaseball19::I thought it was awesome.  The fox picture was excellent.
Aicyla22::it was well deserved, not to toot my own horn or anything...

koke359977::duro, what happened to your pic?
Djuki 3::which one?

Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Can't say... but lets say 25-35
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Duro.. I just hope if you find a Latin G/F and she takes you home to meet her Dad that you choose introduction very carefully.
RunTheBall22__::i don't think that guy swings that way.
MiamiFan2004::RunTheBall22__ - i don't think that guy swings that way.  So you are trolling even a lighthearted discussion?  You truly are a runny RunTheBall22__ that needs to be flushed.
Djuki 3::a gay joke?
Djuki 3::hahahahaha!
RunTheBall22__::a survey of 500 heat fans asked who they thought was a better player, MJ or Lebron ? 85% of heat fans said who is MJ while the others said Lebron was the best ever with his one ring in three finals
MiamiFan2004::RunTheBall22__ - a survey of 500 heat fans asked who they thought was a better player, MJ or Lebron ? 85% of heat fans said who is MJ while the others said Lebron was the best ever with his one ring in three finals  a survey of 50 bulls fans (they couldn't find 500 literate bulls fans) were asked who they thought was a better player, MJ or Rose? 100% of bulls fans said it was MJ while none said Rose was the best ever with his zero rings in zero finals.
MiamiFan2004::*too  Not bitter, unlike you, newb troll.  We are the defedning Champions, you are a bitter troll whose top player tried to pad his stats in a game already decided and that selfishness cost him the chance to lose to the Heat for the second year in a row.
RunTheBall22__::you try to hard and it shows. don't be so bitter heat fan2004 just roll with the punches. have a beer or ten and calm down
oogsalex::We all know that 85% of Heat fans are stupid.
Aicyla22::lol... yes! victory is mine!!
RunTheBall22__::you win this round aicyla but this is not the end of runtheball. i will be back
Aicyla22::thanks i was hoping someone saw it i was proud of it haha

Aicyla22::http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/226/d/a/I__m_a_Stupid_Fox_by_Termi92.jpg
RunTheBall22__::stupid like a fox
Aicyla22::we all know that 100% of bulls fans are stupid
cbbaseball19::This is clearly false
Aicyla22::and his opinions are facts
RunTheBall22__::i never lie
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::most nba fans are dumb... wade top vote getter for all star guardson east team, yet he is not even ranked in top 10 SG in the east...
Bamm7272::Wade: Best SG in the East this year.
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::missed to many games plus minus is -7...lmao
MiamiFan2004::Missed 3 games total.  You wanna tell me how many Rose has missed, newb troll?
Aicyla22::too*
MiamiFan2004::newb troll doesn't know how to look at stats.
MiamiFan2004::What ranking are you looking at?  http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/scoring-per-game/sort/avgPoints/qualified/false/position/shooting-guards  Top shooting guard in the East, LIAR!
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::look on nba rankings and THIS YEAR d.wade is ranked #11
Bamm7272::post the source please
Bamm7272::Name 9 shooting guards better than Wade.  Good Luck.
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::if that game last night was in oaktown we woulda sold out. by the look of a couple thousand empty seats im miami , it proves heat fans are PATHETIC.
MiamiFan2004::we?  You play on the team?  I doubt it.  /good for the goose, good for the gander.
wade.stole.my.wheelchair::sell out or not if seats were empty all over the place... bandwagon fans had something better to do??
Barreldarrel::look harder....
cbbaseball19::its correct.  red and orange have always been the color of the seats in the arena
Barreldarrel::buzzz....wrong answer. Try harder.
Aicyla22::the seats have always been that colour...
Barreldarrel::FYI...Miami had to change the color of their seats since it looked so fricken empty on TV. Miami fans suck.
Bamm7272::you clearly have not been to Miami and the South Beach area.
oogsalex::BULLS remain #1 in attendance.  And we don't even have our star on the court.  Chi fans = real fans!
Bamm7272::Real Chicago fans are great. Just the Haters are kinda weird.
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::I'll give you that...kool
Bamm7272::#3 in attendance in all of the NBA with 101% capacity average for the year so far.
Bamm7272::soz :(
cbbaseball19::You take that back! #2!
Aicyla22::the game was sold out thank you very much
cbbaseball19::Dont try to be sneaky now Knicks!
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::Dude..even if I wanted to ....I'm at work... you have no idea.. Plus I'm not like that.  I told you I like to troll (for fun) but I'm no crook.
Barreldarrel::yea...this is my contribution to negative production

Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::That's awesome.. I love the way they described it on the definition: literally it means hard.
Barreldarrel::bait has been set dude....just pull on the line and your good to go.
Djuki 3::haha i should probably avoid that then
Barreldarrel::until you start talking to their girlfriend....then probably not so funny.
Aicyla22::thats good then
Djuki 3::usually the spanish people laugh and ask me if i'm serious, but no negative reactions
Aicyla22::and by fat i mean morbidly obese
Aicyla22::no i dont i already know he has he likes those pics of the fat chicks
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::She want's to know if you've ever been "DURO"

Djuki 3::no i've never been slapped, i'm very polite
Aicyla22::yea really though has that ever happened to u before?

Djuki 3::haha yeah i know, i've heard that lot growing up
Knicks_Fan_Since_Today::You know that if you went to a Latin bar.. and said Hi I'm Duro... Duro means "HARD"
Gnu1087::Dwade played some incredible basketball in the '05 playoffs and the '06 flopping finals. Other than that... GAHBAGE
Gnu1087::Taking away Dwade would rid the NBA of an underachieving punk.
Aicyla22::haha good one!
MiamiFan2004::You misspelled Kobe.
cbbaseball19::Dos anillos
Gnu1087::You know it's true.  Take away the flops and Dwade is an injury prone average SG
cbbaseball19::Take away D-Wade and the NBA is not the same :(
