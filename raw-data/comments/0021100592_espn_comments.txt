DannyMejia15MVP::On to Memphis! Go Nuggets!
jayeteee::Nuggets did what they had to do. Now go out and beat the Grizz on Sunday.
fatima09med::I think Melo is very talented. But let's be honest here. The Nuggets win more games without him. The Knicks win more games without him. Something has to change. Either Melo has to change his game to the way Pierce has or find a well-defined role as a team player or trade him. I say they should start using him as a 6th man, leader of the second team.
jayeteee::Let's face it, as long as Melo continues to play selfishly, he'll be classified as over rated. I think he has all the talent in the world, but that 10 cent head is killing him.
dcyxc2004::16 million dollar sixth man of the year.
SaintsNO9::It's Amare's $@%!$@ defense more than anything.
I have popcorn in my ears::Ya - go check out the Knicks board.  Knicks fans are NOT happy!
Dallas Sniper::OKC, Spurs, and Mavs lost tonight, which helped the Nugs!!!
Dallas Sniper::A great win after coming off a devastating loss to the Cavs. Lets keep it up, Nugs!!!
I have popcorn in my ears::And Cavs beat the Thunder tonight.  Go figure...
mountainboy33::YA!!!! GO NUGGETS!!!!!
SCastillo504::Rubio, Lebron and Melo walk into a bar...bartender offers them all a drink...Rubio says "Ill pass"...Lebron had one drink but he choked on it at the end...Melo just kept taking shot after shot after shot till his arm got tired and he passed out...
