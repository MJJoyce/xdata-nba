Nacho3501::Detroit blows loloololoololololo
mnsportswopwopwahhh::Detroit why you so turrible?
SF_Bay_Henri::GO T-WOLVES TOMORROW
MNkittenmittens::even after he's healed completely, love needs to take the rest of the season off, lose 25 lbs, and stop being a kobe. wolves need to get healthy and come back strong next season. no expectations though.  high expectations in minnesota only gets you a 25-44 record.
MNkittenmittens::go wolves! we suck but we're still not as bad as detroit!
Tim.Dwight::MN has sucked for how long?
michrules97::The Pistons are not even close to a playoff team and won't be for at least 5 years!  What a joke this franchise has become!  There is no excuse for all of the blowouts this team has been a part of recently.  No heart and awful talent!
MNkittenmittens::Pistons bringing a new Bad Boys era to Detroit, but much more literal.
thunderupman::Durant &gt; love
msu for the win3::Tank so hard Stern wanna fine us
msu for the win3::TANK SO HARD MOTHAFUCKAS WANNA FINE US
tkidu::why.
STEPHEN-A-SMITH::KOBETARDS	 A person whose opinion of basketball player Kobe Bryant is ridiculously biased and revisionist. They believe and will fervently affirm that he is the best player to have ever graced a court despite strong evidence and statistics clearly showing the opposite. "Man, Kobe is so clutch" When in fact he will usually have shot jacked his way into making his team need vital last second shots, when they should have been up by 15 long ago.  "5 rings" When in reality Shaq was the one carrying the team for his first 3 titles.  "Kobe is such a better shooter than Jordan ever was" yet stats show that Jordan scored more points, more efficiently and in an era when defenses were much tougher.  Response to all above: "lol, what a kobetard!"
Wolvesfresh::Am I the only one who's noticed that Shved's assist numbers have really started to go up over the past few games? I hope he's finally past the rookie wall.
torrtis::Eastern Conference really doing a who can tank harder competition.
LebronJames1897::kevin love needs to get back quicker. go t-wolves.
LebronJames1897::ricky rubio is in the top 10 of point guards.
coconutheadtaro::No he isn't.
mattzach825::You obiously dont watch the NBA, rubio is a top 10 pg for sure, maybe even top 5, great d, passing, and can shoot at times

Vega_2012::Now the Wolves just have to beat the Lakers to make everyone happy
Tyler BarnesMNSports::Great win Wolves!
Titans_ are_ Oilers::take your finger out that cats butt! ---------- Tiger Woods
Titans_ are_ Oilers::before I go; What is up with those <b>CATS?</b>
Titans_ are_ Oilers::HAD TO ASK AND NEVER WILL STOP!
Titans_ are_ Oilers::thanks for teaching me this :-P . going back to watching PSYCH!
Wolvesfresh::So anyway, after watching film on both players, I think I'd rather have Oladipo than McLemore. Defense doesn't go into slumps and Oladipo is an outstanding defender at the 2 guard spot.
YogaBeer::Players like Oladipo are hard to come by.   D is his game and should be the type of player a team uses against the hot hand.    As a Cavs fan, reminds me of Alonzo Gee.   Takes great pride in his Defense.
Wolvesfresh::I'm a big fan of Gee. I love great defense more than I love great offense. If you look at the teams who win championships, all of them are good defensive teams. The Mavs were a high octane team for many years but never won the title. Then they got a defensive presence in Chandler and boom.
Titans_ are_ Oilers::oh face?
