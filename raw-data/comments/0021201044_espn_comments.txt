cubfan6285::Kurt Heinrich plays hard every night which is great  but is there a worse shooter at his postion in the NBA?
EuropeDude1981::nate has been amazing at times this year. i never understood why my thunder didn't even play him. Now they're looking at underwhelming production off the bench from derek "0-4" fisher and reggie jackson
luvnbayes::The biggest disappointment for the Wolves has been Kirilenko.  I was really excited when he signed but after having watched him all year I now realize why he drove Jerry Sloan crazy for a full decade.  The two Russians have both been horrible, but  i think with Shved it was seen as more of a project, someone whom if the Wolves had been healthy wouldn't have played much.  But AK-47 is in his prime years, and all I can say is,  OVERRATED!
EuropeDude1981::and to think he started the season in great shape and was outstanding  over the summer in the olympics
luvnbayes::It's why I was excited.  MVP last season in his league, great in the Olympics, etc.  He is a very good help defender and I've just listed all of his positive qualitites.
Thechi-gurl::Who heard Mike and Mike this morning complaining the NBA is too predictable and that the best team always wins the championship.  Last year and the year before, the Bulls had the best record. So what defines best team?  The refs?  Always seems like they have something to do with it.
Jaywashing::The Bulls' chase last year was kind of interrupted...you know, by a certain tear of an ACL. The year before that, the Mavs won and I'm still amazed by it. The "best" team doesn't seem to "always" win in the NBA, but beating a Miami or OKC four times out of seven doesn't come easy. Injuries and matchups are important, too; I'm hesitant to blame it on the refs.
ibaker15::Bulls are the best team in the world.
ibaker15::you're ignorant
ibaker15::no they suck

ibaker15::ESPN deleted my comment about white people :(
ibaker15::I love white people
Marilou2016::GO BULLS!!!
partygeorge::Nate is playing so0o good, the Bulls can put fear in a few teams during the playoff.
The Worm 91::they can beat 1-8 East to West!
Dave Knows Best::please tell me you're not serious...this team is unsustainable come playoff time. We're one and done.
slay_rockstarr::Against who? The Bulls can beat any team down 2-8,in a 7 game series.
Original_Rick::Where is Rip (please remember to put down the seat) Hamilton?
LeBronHasNoFullSeasonRing::Trade Rose for a Jenga set. Sure, the Jenga falls apart every 10 minutes too, but at least you can use it sometimes
DBrownDrose::<b>i cAN bOLd</b>
DBrownDrose::<b>BULLSYEAH</b>
teach2002::the bulls need to start over... this team won't win a championship until michael jordan comes back
marcos977::I don't get why the bulls just dont let butler start. Him as a starter this year he's putting up 14.5 ppg and he plays harder D than Bellinelli
sjhaou::no
Bowski93::Last!!
wabam95::What do my fellow Bulls fans think of Brandon Paul? I think he would be a very effective 2 next too Derrick and really hope the Bulls are considering him for this years draft.
Bryce2790::<b> Hello is anybody here ?</b>
