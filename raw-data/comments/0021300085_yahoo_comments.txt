Devin H::utah's starting front line is strong...but..the main front court player on the bench is Rudy gobert who is very young with great potential but only has experience in Euro B leagues..  When Biedrins comes back, if he can recapture his play his first few years with Golden state, it may be a good idea to have Kanter or favors come off the bench as a 7th man  I am sure many will disagree, but a young player that can score, coming off the bench can get confidence playing against tired starters and bench players, get in a flow and still play 30-35 mins, and be  in the game in the 4th..  Biedrins wont be a great 6th man as he is not a scorer..and the second unit needs scoring..
