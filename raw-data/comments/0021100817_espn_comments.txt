bronxbombers1215::lol u so funny  *eye roll*
woodyattjon::Last I checked, the letter D comes before the letter W...Until the Wizards understand this
hamptonrr1::sheesh where's the D 'zards? sad display... but here's to a sucessful Nats' season!
Alex818728::after Deron leaves New jersey roster = morrow and Brooks, atleast the have their lottery pick lol
Novakaine Djokovic::<strong>lol epic fail from Humphries <a href="http://hoopsgrind.com/2012/03/25/lebron-james-vs-kevin-durant/ ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqGK2s6vW4</a> </strong>
FightingIrish595::if brooks can develop some defense, a cor eof him and green and lopez  might be something to build on
wadlez::How good of drafts picks were Vesely and Singleton... not at all
Th3 Rat3d R::Wizards might land the #1 overall pick, they should lose out - whats the point of winning?
woodyattjon::Bobcats already answering your post
Double it up::Dignity
thekola::OH $@%!!!!! Gerald Green with another highlight. Nets need to sign that kid to an extension.
Double it up::Good job Wizards keep losing for a top 3 draft pick

greggiebaba::Ugh!
greggiebaba::C'mon Wiz, keep it to 7 or fewer!
way2legitimate::Two minutes til halftime and not even at 40 comments yet?  C'mon boys!
greggiebaba::The Wiz have started to make some good moves, getting rid of knuckleheads like like Nick Young and JaVale McGee.  It's such a shame because it's the kind of thing you can't ever really predict in the NBA.  All the talent in the world, but no desire and/or ability to understand how the NBA works.
gezabcmures::john wall is the most overrated player in this league
awesomedude101street@gmail.com::are u $@%!$@%! me

greggiebaba::Hey, all those extra ping-pong balls will be worth it one day.
KONY4PREZ::Wall is too good to be on this crap team.Hope he goes to a team with chances.Wizards are worse than the bobcats without wall.
Double it up::That's why we will draft Anthony Davis/MKG and become the thunder of the east.
greggiebaba::No way they have a chance without Nene, Booker, and Blatche.
maguirec3::lol wizards are so bad
Rezo201::Nobody is talking about the game? Oh thats right....

workswil::I think that the Nets have a chance to beat the Wizards because they have Deron Williams. The Nets have good offense.  The Wizards can't stop them.  The Wizards are not going anywhere because they dont have a good defense.  Those boys dont no how to play!!!!!!
Double it up::Good reasoning, You know your basketball.
