AGirlThatLovesSports_::disappointed in Kemba.
Atl7523::Scratch that Josh Smith maybe be traded next month hope Danny Ferry make the right decision.
Atl7523::Who cares....Can this team go deep in the playoffs?...I would be ok if they can make it to the second round and take the other team to seven games...
Kujosh54321::Tough loss but got to move on. Prepare for a winnable game vs the wolves.   Looking forward to all the ridiculous twolf fans' mock trades.
Bobcats Bandwagon::Rough loss..
Mr. Bradford::Can't wait til the Charlotte becomes home of the Hornets again.
tsched::must have been a barnburner.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::the Boobcats have lost how many in a row at home? Now that's just unreal bad. Good job Hawks without multiple players.
20PurpleNurple52::Without 4of our best players.
X3picWarfareX::Good job on the win, Good showing from Vandys rookies!!!!!!!
Dung_Slanger::The HIVE will be ALIVE sooner than later!
braves and rays fans get girls like that::trade dumb a s s j smooth and focus team around hortford and korver
SpyroDash::You calling Josh a dumb@ss and you can't even spell "Horford" correctly? Of course.
braves and rays fans get girls like that::CATS R ONE PLAYER AND TEN SUBS AND A NEW CITY AWAY FROM  A  CHAMPIONSHIP   really
Dung_Slanger::that pic is a dude
cjd08d::LOUD NOISES!!   I bet that girl in your prfile is your gf right? **manti is that you?**
dbuttling1::Is it me but does anyone else think the Cats are one player away from a championship
braveandme::Well...if MJ returned to his prime, and u added Lebron, then ud have a shot.....maybe
Jknox86::^^^^^^ya herd he wants to team up with MJ
dbuttling1::Ya that could work.i heard lebron got his ring and wants to change things in Charlotte
Indychase22897::Dwight
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::In the meantime......raptors are beating the heat lol.
Talentsojhin::11 blocks in the last two games for Biyombo. I wish he could score a bit more to be somewhat of an offensive threat. Oh well, good game Hawks.
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::Josh Smith would be really good, an all-star, in the right system or with the right coach(es). He needs to learn to play within his own game, and stop trying to be a PG or SG so much. Larry Drew and Mike Woodson were too scared to MAKE him do this. He even did it tonight....trying to bring the ball up court and turned it over. Give the ball up to a guard! All that low bball IQ sh ! t he does comes back to bite you in the a s s in the playoffs against teams like the Bulls and Celtics.
braves and rays fans get girls like that::and pigs r ready 2 fly
AGirlThatLovesSports_::hawks sweep the series welp welp welp.
Minnysota Vikings::Josh Smith going for the quadruple double  10 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 turnovers
djsallysal::thank you
airic.ad::He came out like a warrior with most of his team injured.  You guys don't give any credit to J-Smoove, do you?
Minnysota Vikings::You kidding? I want the Wolves to trade Love for Smith and Korver!
taylormenczynski::it happens lulz
zach57584::he is unconsistant af
riseupfalcons89::You do realize unconsistant isnt a word right
patsmayo1::i admit it i was wrong, this bobcats defense is atrocious.. Josh Smith tearsdrops are just plain lucky at this point though, the guy cant miss!!
airic.ad::Leave Josh alone!
zach57584::rondo
rlathdus...::would you guys rather have josh smith or rondo
X3picWarfareX::J SMoove
Joshua43786::Rondo would be our first real point guard in a while
zach57584::Rondo
taylormenczynski::both :D
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::Horford &gt; J-Smoove
rlathdus...::i agree.
BKNets123456::lol
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::"J-Smoove" will come out against a playoff quality team and try to play the point....or be a SG...and end up with multiple turnovers and 0-8 FG on jumpshots. Performances like this against the  likes of the  Bobcats....mean nothing.
djsallysal::guys a beast and might get us dwight soo....
AGirlThatLovesSports_::Ben Gordon and his hero ball.
pantherfan2488::Welp.  That''s it for me.  Gotta get to work.
AGirlThatLovesSports_::why do  they always try to make runs at the end of the game, should of done that earlier.
AGirlThatLovesSports_::^_______^
rlathdus...::IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE! it is the hawks, after all...
Duke_Lost_My_House69::wow Korver can fuc.king shoot!
djsallysal::Smoove has 24 12 7 and 3 blocks leave him alone
djsallysal::seems like a good defense..
rlathdus...::this is exactly how celtic fans defend rondo. 'he almost had a triple double; what do you want from him?"
rlathdus...::IT'S OKAY CATS! YOU GOT THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!
rlathdus...::no wonder josh smith and rondo are best buds. their inconsistency sounds similar
AGirlThatLovesSports_::same ole $@%! bobcats, just a different game.
pantherfan2488::Atlanta is not our rival.  They beat us too many times for that.  Orlando Magic are our rivals.
ThomasCarr::The Lakers are our rivals. We beat them a lot lol.
pantherfan2488::I love how when bobcats see some light, every team we play hits a 3 immediately after that.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen that happen.
ThomasCarr::It's almost like clockwork. We double the bigs and then that happens.
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::Josh Smith is GREAT one night.....Terrible the next...or Great for 1 half and TERRIBLE for the 2nd half. I'd rather have someone who can just be consistently good.
Roweey::In my Opinion... It looks as if the Hawks are waiting to Resign Josh In the FA If Possible Only if The Main Option D12 Doesn't sign with LA
rlathdus...::as a celtics fan, he sounds exactly like rondo.
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::Paul Milsap or Al Jefferson
ThomasCarr::So trading him for young players and picks or?
WillyDub::Smoove kinda went back to bad Smoove here.
rlathdus...::COME ON, CHARLOTTE!!!!!! YOU CAN DO IT!!!!
Lemuel7043::smoove was hit in the arm
Roweey::Josh was fouled.. No Call..
taylormenczynski::Biz was just blocked straight up cause he went up weak with one hand.
Talentsojhin::so was biz.
Roweey::Lol No He wasn't.. All Ball......
Lemuel7043::lol nope
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::Josh Smith gave up an easy layup to pad his stats for a potential assist and possible triple double. Ivan bricked the jumper.
pantherfan2488::why no timeout by ATL?
ThomasCarr::COMEBACK LOL
pantherfan2488::Sessions vs. Atlanta
rickyoil::wow how bad is jordan as an owner?????????????
Joshua43786::MJ just needs to go to broadcasting. It's obvious based on his draft history that his eye for talent is lacking.
Joshua43786::Anybody who drafted Kwame Brown number one must be a horrible talent evaluator. That's the story of MJ. Greatest player ever, worst talent evaluator ever
ThomasCarr::Other GM's were prepared to draft Kwame Brown in the top 5 if he fell past #1.
rickyoil::very true
pantherfan2488::as bad as your troll attempts
rickyoil::kid i like the bobcats im from nc so try again
ThomasCarr::He's actually a pretty good owner. Terrible GM
Barrk_40::Sessions &gt; Nash
taylormenczynski::Well looks like the hawks have this game, however id like to see them play again in three years after MKG and Taylor and Walker get older and better, they should be a good core.
taylormenczynski::Im a hawks fan but it would seem as if the bobcats will be fine in three years as long as their fan base stays with them during the stretch
ThomasCarr::Plus more lottery picks and smart trades by Rich Cho. Honestly, we'll be fine.
_DeKalbCounty_ATL::I wanna see Anthony Morrow and Korver on the court at the same time when Morrow returns. 3s all day.
Joshua43786::Bobcats are folding worse than the lawn chair I keep in my garage
Joshua43786::It's too easy. When a team is this bad you can't help but laugh at them.
ThomasCarr::Why are you so obsessed with insulting the Bobcats?
