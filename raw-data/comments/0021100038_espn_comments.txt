utep1313::i'm the last one to post a comment
buller23::its just like i said about jordans will to win. kobe has that will to win and b the best to. it cracks me up how people count him and the lakers out. iam die hard bulls fan. but i no the lakers will b there at the end.  bulls  lakers would b a great match up in the finals
The AnomaIy::that will to win did nothing for us in the playoffs last year.  one game doesn't make a season at all. i'm picking OKC to the Finals this year. we have no hope at all of beating them. dude we're still starting derek F+++ING fisher, Russell Westbrook is going to eat us alive.
buller23::like i said iam die hard bulls but i just dont no if their ready. i hate the heat but realize how dangerous they r.whoever  gets ther i hope heat lose.
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::Heat &amp; OKC would be awesome. Memphis is a sleeper, and Dallas might gel and learn to play together and do something too
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::Laker haters start a website where you bash the Lakers in the beginning of the season, and wait for the post season, and lets see if your not a little nervous
buller23::there best shot was 93, they had my bulls down 2  zip in the  ECF.  then they forgot who they were playing. bulls won in 6
sprtfanusa::THAT WAS GREAT HOW JORDAN BI TCH SLAPPED EM!!!!!
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::I remember that. I was so depressed after game 2
buller23::i was down to.  but i still thought they would win. who the heck did pip block in game 5 with about 20 sec. to go? was it charles smith?

ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::ALL LAKER HATERS LIKE THIS COMMENT IF YOU WANT YOUR TEAM TO PLAY THE LAKERS IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PLAYOFFS...   ALL LIKE BUTTONS NO LONGER WORK LOL
._Lakester_.::hit refresh
TectonicPlatter::"I enjoy going against Melo, because I always win," Bryant said with a grin.   The fact Kobe expressed this so freely should embarrass the Knicks and their fans..lol.
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::TectonicPlatter you are too smart for this board. You need to go to an old school bar and talk to people who truly understand the game. Not these puberty people on here
buller23::can i join u
NFLNLA2014::The Knicks were in the Finals back in 1999, really? What happened?
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::I WOULD RATHER LOSE TO HIM OR DUNCAN THAN TO GET SWEPT BY DALLAS ANY DAY OF THE WEEK
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::THEY LOST, AND, YOU SAID THEY HAVENT BEEN GOOD FOR 35 YEARS, I WAS JUST MAKING A POINT, IN THE 90s THEY WERE IN THE ECF A COUPLE TIMES ONLY TO LOSE TO THE GREATEST TO EVER PLAY, NO SHAME IN THAT, SINCE LA LOST TO HIM TOO
The AnomaIy::By the time LA lost to him Showtime was over. Riley was gone, Kareem was gone and Magic was on his way out.  No way in hell Jordan would have put a real ShowTime team out in 5 or less games
NFLNLA2014::They accomplished all of that? Look up the word futility and get back to me.......
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::Lakers might actually be a scary team that no one wants to play in the playoffs this year
The AnomaIy::not/ wtf is it with people and one game
sprtfanusa::FOR SURE
NFLNLA2014::LADIES AND GENTLEMAN INTRODUCING YOUR NEW YORK KNICKERBOCKERS:  With 35 years of futility
sprtfanusa::The Knicks are a joke,they play streetball. C'mon Man!!! Streetball is fun but it doesn't work in the NBA
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::REALLY, NOW YOU "LIKE" HIS JOKE AFTER I POST THAT, LA FANS WILL DO ANYTHING
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::BTW, THEY DID PLAY FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP IN '99, SO ITS NOT REALLY BEEN 35 YEARS, SO STOP WITH THE LAME JOKES THAT GETS NO "LIKES"
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::JUS LIKE FOOTBALL IN LA, ONCE AGAIN, WATS UR POINT? SAY SOMETHING THE PPL ALREADY DONY KNOW
ajansan::What happened Knicks?
sprtfanusa::nothing, they've been this way for YEARS!!!!
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::THEY NEED A TRUE PG AND A NEW FU CKIN COACH!!   FIRE MIKE ASAP!! GO KNICKS!!
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::BEAKING NEWS (TO SOME) TONEY DOUGLAS IS NOT A PG
SoCalVC::that's news to everyone, no one watches knicks games
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::I WILL PASS....BRO!!
cSSk2011::hit your caps lock again bro
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::ALOT OF PPL IN THIS ROOM ALONE KNOWS THAT HES NOT
cSSk2011::haha
SoCalVC::jordan had pippen and dennis rodman, kobe had soft pau and injury prone bynum and he still won a couple rings with them
buller23::theres alot of things these younger guys dont understand about jordan.  iam 50 years old. have enjoyed sports all my life, and have NEVER seen any player from any sport with a greater will to win than jordan. thats what people who didnt watch him play dont get his will to win was unmatched.
buller23::jordan also had a game unique to him.  kobe copied jordans game. kobes great but u c so much of jordan in him. thats why i like watching him play. but theres  nothing like the original
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::I agree and think people should not hate on him simply because he just wants to be  like the best. He has done a great job. Ignorant Kobe fans do not know that him and Jordan talk all the time, and JOrdan gives him many pointers
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::It's funny how Laker fans downplay the skill of their roster when they are trying to make their Kobe is the best argument LOL. Name me 2 centers in the league better than Bynum... Name me 3 Power forwards in the league who are more complete and better than Pau... And notice how you all cried when the Lakers didn't get the best point guard in the league to attract the best center in the league. Jordan was too busy beating the best centers in the league (Ewing, Hakeem, Robinson) and the best power forwards (Malone, Duncan, Barkley), and the best point guards in the league (Magic, Isaiah, Stockton) instead whining because they don't play with him. And yes Lebron is pathetic too. BREAKING NEWS: JORDAN HAS DECIDED TO GO PLAY FOR THE PISTONS TO JOIN THE BAD BOYS... UM NO! Jordan is the GOAT playa, accept it, and enjoy watching Kobe who is one of the top 5 skill players everless
._Lakester_.::agree
buller23::COULD NOT OF SAID IT ANY BETTER MY FRIEND
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::LETS NOT FORGET ABOUT SHAQ NOW
SoCalVC::definitely not ancient, ask the knicks
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::KOBE IS NOT ANCIENT, WHICH ONE IS IT?
SoCalVC::im talking recent, dont bring up the shaqtus
TectonicPlatter::It's a bad idea to use a ring aruegment...even janitors get rings...lmfao.
SoCalVC::what do you play in the nba for then? i thought the goal was to win titles?
SoCalVC::well the lakers win titles, so we as fans have the right to gloat
._Lakester_.::I agree with your comment TectonicPlatter
TectonicPlatter::Of course it is, but this generation of fans have changed the discussion to selfish individual accomplishments over team accomplishments which is what basketball is all about.
cSSk2011::Im reading htis new book, its a best seller:  "How i swindled 100mil for doing next to nothing"  By Amare Stoudamire
buller23::the fans should chip in and buy d antoni a book.  DEFENSE FOR IDIOTS
SoCalVC::melo's co-writing it too
Z Wade::What happened to all of the Knicks fans proclaiming they'd win it all this season, despite their team still not knowing how to play defense?
sprtfanusa::their not a rucker park, stop playing streetball(all one on one) and try running a play for a change.
buller23::their not very bright in new york
sprtfanusa::or offense either. that's a bad team
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::HOW DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO WIN WITHOUT A TRUE PG?
cSSk2011::no, hes terrible
SoCalVC::tony douglas aint bad
NFLNLA2014::Have the Knicks won anything in the last 35 years? I'm not 100% sure
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::NO SH IT, BUT NOBODYS TALKIN BOUT THE KNICKS, UNTIL THESE COMMENTS COME FLYING OUTTA LEFT FIELD SOMEWHERE
buller23::i think they won it in 1969 with phil jackson on the team
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::IS THAT ALL YOU CAN SAY? NOBODY HERE IS TALKIN BOUT THE KNICKS
Z Wade::IT'S A MESSAGE BOARD FOR A KNICKS GAME, GENIUS
SoCalVC::yea cause they suck
cSSk2011::if there was an award for "the most potential and then failing" then they wouldve won that
SoCalVC::how many rings does kobe have again? i lost count after 3
buller23::hey socal were u born when jordan won his first 3. who was on that team besides pip?
chompah99::Mythology. Jordan Bulls were some of the best teams, ever. Top 5 SF of all time, #1 player of all time, top 5 defender, #1 rebounder of all (in modern era, when 99% of the league wasn't 6'5" or less. One of the best and most clutch 3 pt shooters of all time. One of the best 6th man ever.
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::Dont argue with high schoolers about Jordan. Dude some high schooler the other day tried to tell me that Kobe was as good of a passer as Magic. They know nothing except what ESPN shows them
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::U CANT COUNT HIGHER THAN 3, CHEESE N RICE!!
TectonicPlatter::How many rings does Robert Horry have? I can't count that high.
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::It's funny how Laker fans downplay the skill of their roster when they are trying to make their Kobe is the best argument LOL. Name me 2 centers in the league better than Bynum... Name me 3 Power forwards in the league who are more complete and better than Pau... And notice how you all cried when the Lakers didn't get the best point guard in the league to attract the best center in the league.

Jordan is the GOAT playa, accept it, and enjoy watching Kobe who is one of the top 5 skill players ever
SoCalVC::jordan had pippen and dennis rodman fool, kobe had soft pau and injury prone bynum and he still won a couple rings with them
buller23::steve kerr has 5.  i would hardly put him in kobes class
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::A Couple with Houston, &amp; a couple with San Antonio. Your point is? If the ring argument is so important, then Shaq is the greatest center of all time... So therefore Kobe got 3 of his rings playing with the greatest center of all time. Lebron has never had a center, and Jordan had a token center because you do need 5 guys on the court. Kobe tried to mimic Jordan with Chris Mihm, but when he didn't even make the playoffs he noticed that it wasn't working out
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::LET ME REMIND YOU, LIKING UR OWN POSTS IS UNAPPEALING, DONT YOU LISTEN?
._Lakester_.::7
TectonicPlatter::Yeah I remember Robert Horry helping Kobe get his rings..lol.
SoCalVC::a couple with LA, you remember that?
NFLNLA2014::The city of angels will have a NFL team in 2014 if not sooner then we will own football as well just like basketball
supordupor23::The Raiders will never go back, they are staying.  BOOM
._Lakester_.::Cant understand why we have 2  NBA Teams, 2 MLB teams, 2 NHL Teams if you want to count the Ducks and no NFL teams
NFLNLA2014::Soon we will have 2 NFL teams
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::JUS LIKE BEFORE WHEN THEY LEFT HUH?
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::@ LAKESTER  I LIVE IN INDIANAPLOIS, THATS WHERE MCBOB WAS BORN. PLAYED HIGH SCHOOL BALL IN CARMEL, WHICH IS BOUT 10 MINUTES NORTH OF INDY
SoCalVC::and now he's ballin for LA
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::WE ALREADY COVERED THAT, THANKS FOR PLAYING
._Lakester_.::I drove through Indianapolis one time. Nice city
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::ITS ALRIGHT I GUESS, COULD BE BETTER, I HATE THE COLD WEATHER THE MOST
._Lakester_.::When I was in the Navy. I drove from Chicago to Virginia
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::BS!!
TectonicPlatter::I bet you guys didn't realize this, but if Wade gets another Finals M.V.P. he will be tied with Kobe..and he only has one championship..lolz.
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::NO Shaq did not get the finals MVP playing with Wade, but he did playing with Kobe all 3 times they won LOL
SoCalVC::like jordan
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::Past his prime and winning titles, yep that's Shaq. Kobe needs a big period to win
SoCalVC::yea shaq was past his prime with wade, yet kobe is still winning titles
SoCalVC::lebron will get the mvp
SoCalVC::shaq played a huge part
TectonicPlatter::I remember Shaq not playing a big part when they needed him in the Finals..it was all Wade. Did Shaq get the Finals M.V.P.? Nope.
SoCalVC::lol didnt shaq play a big role in getting wade that mvp?
TectonicPlatter::No he won't..he doesn't have the heart to lead.
._Lakester_.::White boys are making a comeback. Bob Sura would of been proud
supordupor23::Zarko Cabarkaba.  There's one I bet you guys haven't heard in a while
galagator25::Holy hell there's a name I haven't heard in forever.
NFLNLA2014::Mike Penbernathy started a revolution
SoCalVC::dont forget slava medvendanko
NFLNLA2014::How are the Knicks and Nets still a NBA franchise????
buller23::hey the rams were there first
SoCalVC::keep them in STL
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::CHARGERS ARE NOT MOING TO LA
SoCalVC::google search farmers field and come back
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::THE COLISEUM, REALLY, I WOULDNT PUT MY HOPES IN MAGIC IF I WERE YOU
SoCalVC::chargers have an old $@% stadium, they dont sell out games. theyre moving to LA
._Lakester_.::If the Chargers move to L.A., I just cant find myself being a fan of them. I still want my Raiders to come back
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::SURE, IMA GAMBLIN MAN
SoCalVC::wanna bet?
ListenToMeAndYouWillKnow::Learn grammar. "How are the Knicks AND Nets still NBA franchises?"

NFLNLA2014::Have you ever noticed when there is a mention of the greatest players in NBA history the Knicks are never on the list.....can someone name 5 great Knick players? You cant include Spike Lee!!

mintzerkj4eva::The Knicks will never play D until they get rid of Mike.
._Lakester_.::I personally dont believe in comparing players from different eras and different positions
SoCalVC::lakers just destroyed the pretender knicks
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::U WATCHING THE RE-PLAY?
SoCalVC::na i just saw last nights highlights and i couldnt stop laughing at how bad the knicks are
NFLNLA2014::Who is on your top ten list MELOS SWEATY BALLS I mean headband?
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT
TectonicPlatter::If there were two Laker jerseys worth getting..they would be Magic Johnson's or Elgin Baylor's jersey.

MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::YOU CAN TELL BY JUS LOOKIN?
TectonicPlatter::Yeah just by looking.
NFLNLA2014::TOP TEN GREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME IN NBA HISTORY  10. Shaq 9.   David Robinson 8.   Pistol Pete 7.   Dr. J 6.   Jerry West 5.   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 4.   Wilt Chamberlin 3.   Michael Jordan 2.   Larry Bird 1.   Magic Johnson
._Lakester_.::I just noticed Bird over Jordan and tell me why David Robinson is on there
._Lakester_.::the Big O should be on there as well
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::WHY DOESNT KARL MALONE GET ANY LOVE, HES #2 ALL TIME IN SCORING
Gillyballer1980::seriously? That's your list?
._Lakester_.::Pistol Pete? LMAO! He was one of the greatest, but not top 10
._Lakester_.::Kareem should be ranked higher
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::BIRD LOWER
supordupor23::Rick Barry over Dr J.
._Lakester_.::Kobe should be somewhere on that list
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::ALL I CAN SAY IS, PASS THAT SH IT THIS WAY
supordupor23::Dear New York Knicks:  You just got thoroughly embarrassed by the West Coast.  Please take your ridiculously overrated team back to the (L)East coast, and stop trying to tell everyone that your team is good
supordupor23::Knicks suck.  That is all.
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::UNAPPEALING I SAY
truesportfanman::In a game of 21, Kobe would beat lebron by 8.
supordupor23::Yea that was a sick shot, but Kobe has been burying those for 10 years
supordupor23::Kobe is the best.  A lot of people disagree with me on this, but he is the best.  He has god damm icewater running through his veins.  There isn't one player in the NBA who is more clutch than Kobe
Gillyballer1980::I have to say, you might have to give that to Durant now. I mean, you see that shot? LOL
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::CLUTCH TH ESE!!
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::IN MAKE IT TAKE IT, AND LBJ GETS THE BALL 1st, KOBE NEVER SCORES
Gillyballer1980::lol, I don't know about that one
TectonicPlatter::Jordan has 6 Finals M.V.P. to say it was all him. Kobe has only 2.   NFLNLA2014 = <b>$@%!$@%<b></b></b>
buller23::i love pipen he was a great player and a great person. i would never minimize pips impact. i think he was top 3 all time defensive player. shut down magic in 91. trust me jordan would not have won as many without pip. but he still would of won. pip got screwed in 94. should of been mvp that year
jcmaggi::I digress, my point is that 14 years after their last title together, to hear the nut huggers tell it, MJ was this mythical basketball player that could sh*t fireballs and dropped 60 on the regular and Pippen was a scrub.
jcmaggi::MJ might have won without Pippen, he might not have. Pippen was one of the best wing defenders ever (if not the best). It's ironic, the one guy that might have been able to cover MJ was Pippen.
jcmaggi::Really? It was all MJ? Is that why when he retired the first time the Bulls made it to the Eastern Conference semis and where a bad call from the Eastern conference finals?
Gillyballer1980::lol, yeah I loved the NBA in the late 80's and 90's(entire..., except the last season, lol)
jcmaggi::Why do MJ nut huggers always minimize Pippen. The guy was a stud and a top 50 NBA player of all time.
._Lakester_.::yeah, The Bulls made me miserable in the 90's
Gillyballer1980::I wouldn't say that is accurate. Jordan was a young player on a bad team. To expect him to then win against those teams would have been a bit much. That 90-91 team would have banged with those teams though.
._Lakester_.::MJ wasnt winning anything until the Celtics, Pistons, and the Lakers got old
._Lakester_.::"Noone wins sh.it without me"  - Phil Jackson and his 11 rings
buller23::love phil to best coach ever. had a unique way to get the very best from players by putting them in situations where they could succeed
truesportfanman::Jordan don't win one without me.  ---scottie pippen
._Lakester_.::buller23 - I will not argue that
buller23::watched every single game jordan ever played. his will to win and desire to b the best player ever were unmatched. and he drove that will into pip. and that matched with their great talent made them in to the greatest duo to ever play. those guys refused to lose. so ur right, mj never won 1 without pip. but jordan molded pip into the hof player he was and it was fun to watch
._Lakester_.::Jerry West won a Finals MVP but didnt get the ring
TectonicPlatter::Where are your Finals M.V.P.'s Pippen?
NFLNLA2014::And your comment says that your still in grade school
TectonicPlatter::Fairweather fans are silly.
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::WHO ELSE WOULDA GOT ONE, PIPPEN? PROB NOT
NFLNLA2014::No player wins a championship on their own......TectonicPlatter = MORON
jcmaggi::That's pretty much what every Hater demands of Kobe.
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::DUH, WHO WOULD WIN 1 ON 5?
._Lakester_.::Kareem is the GOAT in my opinion  Most points (38,387) Most minutes played (57,446)  Most field goals made (15,837)  Most field goals attempted (28,307)  Most All-Star selections (19)  Most All-Star games played (18)
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::I REALLY DONT THINK KAREEM IS BETTER THAN WILT, JUS SAYIN
jcmaggi::It's really amazing how he gets so little run for GOAT when he has 6 rings and so many records and accolades.
jcmaggi::Lakester -  Barring a career ending injury, Kobe will surpass Shaq this season, Wilt next season, and MJ the season after that.
._Lakester_.::He could finish somewhere in the top 3 before he retires. I can see him being 2nd all time realistically if he stays healthy
jcmaggi::Lakester -   Kobe has an outside chance. He would have to play an additional 5 seasons after this one and maintain his 25 ppg for about 75 games per season. I mean not impossible, but highly unlikely.
._Lakester_.::I dont think anyone will beat Kareem's point total
jcmaggi::Even if you give MJ the 3770 extra field goals that Kareem had and assume MJ would hit his expected 1.316 points per FGA, he would still fall about 1000 points short.
MELOS SWEATY HEADBAND::MOST SHOT ATT. SHOULD= MOST POINTS
Gillyballer1980::Hard to argue against that no matter what era you watched.
