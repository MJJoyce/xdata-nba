RICHARD THUG SHERMAN::Update. Wall 5-19 and now shooting career low 37.9.  Most overpaid player in the NBA.
von98::Good win tonight! Go Spurs Go!
clint::How do the Spurs keep winning without a guy taking 20 or more shots a game?
Joeseph::spurs will get this
PKM::Spurs just know how to play.
Cyril::I hate to say it, but Duncan is finally starting to hit that wall.  Not as hard as Steve Nash this year, but he is clearly not the same player he was last year. Maybe it's just a slump, but at least the rest of the team is really stepping up.
floatpool::So B, should the Spurs give the win back?
KK::The wizards are only the 3rd best team in the East
BossMan::THAT's the Wizards we know and love... can't score 80...  pitiful!!
Brandon T::Keep shooting Wall, you're bound to make like a quarter or so of your shots
