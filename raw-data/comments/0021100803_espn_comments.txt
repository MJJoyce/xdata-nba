August18869::I think that durant is a much better scorer then lebron. And i would want the ball in his hands during crunch time, but Lebron is better at everything else. For all you idiots Durant is not overated though.
..Brutus2012::The Heat suck!!!  OKC by 6 pts!! With 2:29 left in game !!
Varg9973::heat in 4.

MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::Lol espn just said what lebron did lastnight is not a big deal ..they watch jordan n kobe do it in the playoffs all there career.lebrick fans I understand your all wet since lebron has a game like this once a year...haha
Jpgarcia2010::You talkng about when Kobe  choked when it mattered most right? Don't remember? Check his stats. both.game 7 against the Celtics.. got bailed out by the likes of ariza artest Odom n gasol
SoonersTheDestroyers::Thunder vs Heat NBA Finals:  Thunder in 5
hapatino::AS long as we are telling jokes - Heat in 4
xxxhawk::Durant again proved he is another kobe. Volume shooter, scores alot but not much else. Durant's stat line stunk, nothing except 9 turnovers. Lebron plays a complete game, does it all.
D Wade fan since 04-05::Durant has struggled in the playoffs every time it was time to play against a better team.
Jpgarcia2010::Lebron will go down as the best ever to play the game
Bexindy55::I love Lebron's comment, "This is playoff basketball."  Now I know why he doesn't play in the playoffs....he thinks its the regular season. Got it backwards buddy.
D Wade fan since 04-05::Taking comments out of context I see.
A-dude playing the dude disguised as another dude::CALL ME WHEN LEJOKE WINS 6 RINGS,,I GUESS I WILL BE WAITING FOR THAT CALL FOR LONG TIME LMAO
Jpgarcia2010::And to question if hes good or not... Seriously? Mj retired from the bulls 1994 1995, and from what I remember bulls made it to the playoffs,.right? Cleveland on the other hand made it to the lottery when Lebron left nice try kid
Jpgarcia2010::Lebron is only 27 and got a whole lot of bball in him.. And already shooting 53 percent? He defends any position 1 thru 5
Jpgarcia2010::If you count rings then bill russells the greatest, then all the Celtics players, then horry then mj. Lebron only needs to win a ring or 2 to be the greatest ever stupid
LordKoop::Don't you worry, Lebronze will be MIA in the 4th quarter when the playoffs come around.
Asif11111::u got some jokes
Asif11111::LOL nevermind you ARE the joke hahahaha
LordKoop::Not a joke bro, I'm serious. HEATNATION!
Khari9772::tired of hearing about bulls fans derrick rose is a girl. Hes trying to save up energy so he can be fresh for the playoffs too bad it wont help . HEATNATION
A-dude playing the dude disguised as another dude::^ hahahah your hiding on lejoke dick, thinking he is going to win hahahhaha
Khari9772::funniest think i heard all night lebron is lucky there in reference to the westbrook foul. Im not sure what man your watching but im pretty sure lebron would murder anybody on the court  no pun intended. Westbrook ugly in the face and hes a hawk. Of course you bums wont win if westbrook shoots more than the "mvp" apahahha good joke lebron had the lead in the mvp race since 20th game
Bexindy55::Learn what a pun is you illiterate fool and maybe people will take your comments seriously.
A-dude playing the dude disguised as another dude::^FAIL
mwrigley7::Check out my thoughts and analysis of the Dwight Howard-Stan Van Gundy situation and more top sports news here: http://destination4sports.blogspot.com/
EOeagles724::Kevin Durant is the most overated player in the nba and I have stats that will back me up on this
xxxhawk::Durants stats show he is just a volume shooter like kobe, scores alot but not much else. Lebron does it all &amp; much better.
SoonersTheDestroyers::LeJoke will always be the most overrated player in the NBA!!!
A-dude playing the dude disguised as another dude::^Lejoke is the most overrated player in NBA
inglehacker::So I guess everyone who was ready to give Durant the MVP after one decent game against the Heat need to give it back to Lebron now?
SoonersTheDestroyers::I doubt it..  since the Heat was punked in OKC.    And close game in miami.
D Wade fan since 04-05::One game?
saxman6769::Lebron showed last night he got big cojones
lamriverside11::Ramon sessions VS CP3!!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDXdnZpxqQ4
Guitar Bob::I still think LeBron is the best player in game today. And in my opinion the MVP should be given to the best player in the league, and today, that guy is LeBron. If a draft was made today with all the players in the league, LeBron would be drafted N° 1, Durant N° 2, etc.  This could be LeBron's last MVP too, because I highly believe that Kevin Durant will win it next year. If he keeps improving the way he has and scoring the way he has and stays healthy, there's just no way anybody will be better than him next season. I wouldn't be surprised if he won the next 2 MVP awards.  That's just what I think though, I could be wrong.
Bexindy55::He's the one with the "potential" to be the best player in the game.  They don't give out MVPs for potential. Sorry buddy.
MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::Bulls coming out the east easy..
___slickSixtySix___::and hamilton's arm already fell off
Finatic335::not likely ... rose cant even stay healthy
MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::Thunder blows out the heat...j Heat and the refs beat the thunder by 5pts... lmao thunder clearly the better team...
fairandbalanced00::thunder was beating chicago by 30pts, thank goodness for chicago that okc decided to rest its starters and bring the bench to finish the game. Miami will pummel chicago again in 5games. Same players=same results.
southridge305::its ok to not like a team, but say the refs gave heat the game is childish and something a kid would say. i guranteed you wasnt on here saying refs gave okc the game even though they shot 9 more free throws then heat in okc. fact is heat took the ball to the rim and either got rejected or foul.  i can tell u that okc is not beating heat in a series with westbrook going 9 of 26. can okc play physical for seven games, can they play tough defense for 7 games.. ibaka is a beast, but if bosh ever gets his head out his butt its a wrap
SoonersTheDestroyers::Your an idiot!!
masonnguyenv::Durant is a P.ussy. His skinny $@% can even post up or pass right.
SoonersTheDestroyers::Lebron is a P.ussy!!  Perkins will flatten that ugly $ucked up nose worse than it already is.
Kn121989::Thunder vs Heat NBA Finals: Heat in 6 or 7
bucksnreds::5
MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::Jordan with pippen champions kobe with gasol champions lebrick with wade and bosh still cant get the job done...lmao
southridge305::after one season u come here speaking non sense... what about the year kobe didnt win with gasol
TheMiamiHeat365::Full Highlights of HEAT vs OKC  http://miamiheat365.blogspot.com/2012/04/heat-vs-thunder-highlights-april-4-2012.html
TheMiamiHeat365::Lebron HAS the Clutch Gene! http://miamiheat365.blogspot.com/2012/04/lebron-has-clutch-gene.html
MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::Haha joke of the decade ^^
Taphawn::was very shocked to see that Miami won the game
JaxFl45::Kids will play and story tell too. Lebron is the best thing in the NBA, that's why everyone wants his name in their mouth. Whats that other guy name that play in the west?....oh snap, I forgot!
MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::Most overated player ever griffin or lebron??? Damm pretty hard...
MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::Finals win games..jordan 24 kobe 23 lebron 2 lmao
zayzkidd::On Sunday you can download Southcidal's '100 Classics in 100 Days' MX TAPE FREE (First 25 Days)... Just visit www.southcidal.com
zayzkidd::This win was all about Lebron.... Wade didn't even get too much into this game. Imagine when Wade shows up as we know he would if this were a Finals match... Miami would beat them 4-1.
1522scooter::Lebron cant gaurd Durant which is why they were double teaming Durant as soon as he got the ball about the three point line.
JaxFl45::You sound like a fool. KD had a career high in turnovers, nine to be exact. OKC giving hard fouls as if that could help them win. You don't pull people down or try to hurt them intentionally. I understand the games being physical but flagrants fouls is just dirty. Still, you can't stop a freight train. Grow up and stop crying and lying about what happened in the game.
1522scooter::heat suck. they'll be knocked out in the second round
MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::28years old 9years in the nba ringless no clutch in him not a closer and join 2other superstars for the easy way out....lmao never compare garbage overated lebrick to Mj or Kobe..
sespi001::you must of forgotten kobe 2004-2007
MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::Bynum was draft it as a laker idiot bynum was not even a factor in 09 10 missing over 100games in total...lebron went to wade n bosh by choice for the easy way out fact...only u lebrick fans cant see it is comedy...hsha
dynamyteus::well.... lets see.... the lakers are all about star power.....  buying like what 15 allstars for kobes five titles and the bulls did the same for jordan with rodman and co.....       say what you want every title team is built there isnt a team that isnt..  its pro ball...... so go ahead and hate on bron but thing is all your arguments.....  they all prove that your just hatin on him cause he is the best
zayzkidd::I agree with you on MJ... but KOBE? PLEASE!!!
elchupanibre1::Who really won? The heat did.
1522scooter::"Its just regular season. It doesn't matter"  ---Heat fans--
hapatino::The best player in the NBA dominated the second best player in the NBA.
MiamiDWade23::I agree with this guy, although he didn't completely dominate KD. He still had a much better game but now they're even. LeBron is a much more complete player, but with KD's size and skill set he has the potential to be one of the greats. I don't even know why it's a question on who will win the MVP. Maybe it'll be the most media driven MVP award like it was last year. Who knows... NOBODY! Wait and see!
masonnguyenv::Durant is a P.ussy.  His skinny $@% can even post up or pass right.
T.O Nation 93::durant gonna win a ring first
aquaadverse::you're right. Hardin is absolute crap. And it's Wade and Bosh allowing him to play 4 and defend  5 positions in the same game on a regular basis.
poodagg::its you're, but you are right!
T.O Nation 93::why lebron plays with two other top 5 and top 10 players who does  durant have westbrook? who shoots more then him at point gaurd
954_2_da_305::Your wrong.
johndoe5699::Is Lebron James going for the Amish look?
johndoe5699::What if I am a gay man, have you thought of that, unintellibeam?
rks319::you are better than that
954_2_da_305::F@ggot.
Intellibeam::Let the ladies worry about his looks buddy....You just appreciate his game or don't. That's my advice.
Dr Killapatient::I believe SVG, Howard can't be trusted... This season mess is all the proof you should need.
Intellibeam::He wants to leave a doesn't know how to be political about it. He's a chump anyway
Dr Killapatient::I see your point..
YUNGJCOMMANDER::I am getting tired of media, NBA coaches and players thinking if you play physical with the my Heat that they are soft and you can knock them off their game. We are not scared of any style of play and I will admit we are not a physical team that plays a little dirty. Miami Heat basketball is about playing hard on both ends and being the most conditioned players on the court. Miami Heat basketball is about doing the the little things that do not show up in the box score. Miami Heat basketball is about trust and generating easy basket for yourself and teammates.To quote my fav player of all time D- Wade " Miami Heat player are not fake toughs guys or TV thugs".
Mr_Sootay::"We"??? Are you on the team? Bosh, is that you trying to act tough again?
YUNGJCOMMANDER::@ poodagg I never thought about that way, you are right and plus fans also invest their time and energy into their favorite team not mention the emotional roller-coaster that comes with being a loyal fan.
poodagg::actually sootay, he has every right to say WE!  he invests money in the team, which pays salaries, which gives anyone the right to say my, we, and our when talking about their team!  nice try though!
YUNGJCOMMANDER::LOL @Mr. Sootay I have a bad habit of putting myself in the team, I have been a fan since 2003. My cousins make fun of me all the time for using we's when talking about the Heat.
Intellibeam::Just because kobe stuck his tongue out for the first 8 years of his career don't make him Jordan. It's called a B-Biter dope style taker....tell him to his face he aint nothing but a faker flaker asssss laker.
Intellibeam::Stop putting kobe and Michael Jordan in the same sentence.....It's blasphemous clown!!!!!!
MjandKobeGoat-lebronSidekick::Lmao what lebrick fans witness lastnight jordan n kobe have done it over n over in the playoffs...i quess I cant be mad al lebrick fans is something new to them..haha
Intellibeam::No this is old news....Lebron has been playing the same since he's touched a basketball. Nothing new buddy. Keep up with the truth. Literally and figuratively. And kobe ???? Or you mean Shaq? Kobe barely got the keys to the Lakers 4 years ago clown!
poodagg::kobe did shoot the lakers out of four postseasons when his team was favored to win the title!  best player of his weak era and the most overrated player since wilt!
954_2_da_305::I missed your point. Just felt like typing useless nonsense?
younglouiE::Nobody cares
Mod_in_Tree::even with wade and bosh on his team, lebron still owns every major statistical category for the heat. MVP
1522scooter::which means the rest of the Heat basically suck if Lebron has to do everything. he should have stayed in Cleveland where he had a better team. Lebron is a dumba@@
Intellibeam::Hey Mr Softay you're the only soft one. Run up and down the court twice without a basketball and then come talk to me.
954_2_da_305::Lol he is real soft.
954_2_da_305::Can't mess with the Heat at home. They going to work on their road game and they'll be alright. Let's go Heat!!!
