ledzep3447::Sac. Kings have always been a vagabond franchise.They just have one more move to make.I-5 Northbound!!!!
thomascedill::GG Kings. The Dubs shot poorly and Isiah Thomas was unconscious for the 3s. Hope Coach J can play more drive and kick, inside-out instead of offense just jacking up rushed shots. More open corner 3s too. Our defense is on and off... it was very obvious on that night. W's up
schmitty71435::Seattle Supersonics won. Good job IT, take it to Klay.
davidsan1001::That sucked.  Bogut was a friggin' bright spot though.  Holy Sh!!!!T!!!!!  He was moving and jumping like crazy!!  Warriors seems like an engine with lots of strong pistons.  Some pistons misfire at times, sometimes they get out of sync but man what a great engine!  I guess the coach is like the engineer for this locomotive.  Gotta add a little coal here, blow some steam there, cool with water, let it run for a bit then keep tweaking.  Go Warriors!!
jeffcox::What, did the Lakers take it all out of you guys?  Bad loss here!  (Nice game by Bogut, though.)
jeff050578::I will never understand why Sacramento gives GS such a tough time.
itsatrap13::It just happens. It happens in other sports. One team just happens to be another's kryptonite despite the talent level. Good luck the rest of the year.
LinHardenParsons::Thank you SacTown.  Our ex- Rockets are our secret weapon against the teams ahead of us.
Oaktown1029::I guess the only way you lose when you outscore your opponent in the paint 68-38 is by having your two best outside shooters go a combined 6 for 31!
The_Grand_Poobah3::omg the Kings might win 30 games
Abraham Lincoln - duck hunter::Isaiah Thomas brand Curry paste!  Owned by Isaiah Thomas, just like Steph Curry!
csaeteurn::Good game Kings, Curry and Klay were ice cold, but tailing behind your backs. Hot night for Isiah Thomas, and Klay needs to start driving to the lane if his shots don't come on these nights. HE should already know this... He blew the game for us tonight. Good game though, no panic since Houston lost as well.
Only real fans stick with bad teams::Minnysota Vikings - Where is the new proposed Sacramento arena being built? In the city or in the country like Arco?  Downtown on 5th and K st
Minnysota Vikings::Thanks
Only real fans stick with bad teams::NP the arena looks amazing and so does the whole plan w all the residential, new hotel and everything it will bring....I don't see how the league could decide we deserve to lose the Kings after that...the city just approved it today too so Sac is set!!!
nedieterich::Hey David Stern, You promised the Sonics would not leave Seattle Then you promised us an expansion team. Now you want Sacto to give up their team With all due respect sir, go F yourself ...good luck Kings fans. (from a Sonics fan)

gt1master_ike::Cousins plays too inconsistent.
TIGRES1441::that is true sir
BLazEdTrailerz::Well, I'm sure he... doesn't have any idea who you are.
Marcumm::He may seem like he gets along but his players still dont respect him because hes always just trying to please thugs like demarcus cousins
BLazEdTrailerz::i don like his rotations much either. Seems like he gets along with the players though.
TIGRES1441::i actually hate keith smart
Marcumm::me too
BLazEdTrailerz::I actually like Patterson
Minnysota Vikings::I like him too, just not sure he would be the starter on a playoff team.
