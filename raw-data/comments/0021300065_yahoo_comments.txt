Karel::Hey Lionel, would you consider coming back? -- Grizz front office
Ariel::Grit and Grind? Grizzlies? They surely missed Coach Lionel Hollins now.
kay::The Griz are gosh awful. The dummy owner has already wrecked a winning team. It took him less than a year. What a clown.
fup duck::if Gordon stays healthy, this is a sick guard trio
BrendanH::it is amazing how many times professional athletes take days off. Nothing can be said about this game other than the grizz players just didnt want to be there. Amazing
Edan::Grizz suck. They don't have enough scorers. I thought that was the plan in the offseason. Get more scoring. But now I know the plan. Make the team suck so bad, the city quits supporting them. Then move them out west. NO way this team makes the playoffs. Surely a lottery team.
Golden Groin::The Pelicans put Marc Gasol in a corset and stielttos this game
YoDudeMan::Now this is an interesting win. Is NO that good? or Griz that bad?
Anton::Didn't know the Grizzlies were tanking this season...
sam::I told you the Griz would be lucky to make the playoffs. Spurs showed everyone how to beat 'em.
