greensilkdts::Advanced scout here: cubes my man UCONN'S BREANNA STEWART get her on your radar. and cubes spell my name right on the check this time...:-o.      ADVANCED SCOUT.
Dadsterbug::Another loss....another game officiated by Bennett Salvatore.   I'm pretty sure you can't blame the refs for this loss....but it's just another one in the loss column with Bennett on the floor....Just sayin'!
Eg214::Portland down by 3 with the ball in final seconds and they go for a layup? Anyway Good win by my Mavs even though it was closer than it should of been at the end.
Zarlbane28::tank tank tank... tank tank tank.... lottery
BaySports 1.1::Yeah that was totally idiotic.
Joshuabeightol::We already know the suns or New Orleans will not make playoffs. So who do you fans root for in playoffs?
kosports53::If the Blazers could put 2 halves together, I'd get my 34th win. Might come down to a gift game from the Clips or the Warriors.
mallow23::Why no Dirk down the stretch when Dallas was trying to blow the game?
Eg214::Foot problem nothing serious
AddictedtaQuak::yawn.......
big145fly::dude why the $@%! did meyers only play 14 mins?!?!
ihateamateurs::I'm tired of winning 10k
viper1870::lol
cubsfan33442::2 reasons I'm happy the Mavs won; closer to shaving and Blazers have better odds at a top pick, even if it's a weak draft.
arrogantespncommenter10::Next up for Dallas are the tanking Suns. Good luck.
ncjcrsu::Actually they play the Suns
joyhussain::The best Mavs fans can hope for now is to get ahead of the Lakers in the standings. The Jazz are too far ahead and playing too well.
Aeiouy.com::That is fine with me.  The mavs surrounded an aging superstar with a bunch of end of their contract scraps while the lakers added two potential hall of famers.  If they tie them Beowulf be happy.  To be fair Carlisle is one of the two or three best active coaches.  Popovich is the only one with the clear nod.  On the other hand the lakers manage to have two of the most overrated coaches of the last twenty years coach in the first six games.  Howard has some maturity issues and if he resigns with the lakers they will never win a championship with him.  He needs to work under a coach who will ride him and demand excellence.  Finally the mavs will never catch the lakers record of most theRapist visits in a year.
f1atsp1der::They're not going 1-3... They've already beaten Memphis few days ago n at worst will go 2-2... They're not losing to Minnesota... Guaranteed!
wunderrr::Jazz playing OKC, MIN,@MIN, @MEM...more like 2-2, 1-3
NolaJag::Lillard bringing out his inner Kobe tonight with 15 points on 19 shots.
MTorres727@gmail.com::Man FACK portland and there commentators
sworthin117::why is that?
cubsfan33442::their
hillybilly470::Hmmmmm...............Mavs just might be able to catch the Lakers...............
Brianhau529::How bout Barton, dude looks legit.
joyhussain::Or he'll get injured
joyhussain::he's a Blazer. but I hope he doesn't. Or anyone for that matter
sworthin117::why assume that?
sworthin117::Blazers will cut him
sworthin117::good
Brianhau529::no, he will stay. Babbitt, Nolan, Freeland are all guys getting cut.
FanofTexas38::The Lakers have 2 HOF'ers in their backcourt, and are are struggling to make the playoffs. That's so pathetic.
FanofTexas38::Our oldies were Jason Kidd and Brian Cardinal. Theirs are Steve Nash and Kobe Bryant.
sworthin117::who brought up LA?
FanofTexas38::The Mavs were old as hell two years ago and won it all. Can't use that excuse.
sworthin117::different oldies
Nathan94713::What are the palyoffs? Is it like paleontology?
sworthin117::old
MTorres727@gmail.com::Dallas beat the clips.While the Fakers got blown out by the clips TWICE
MTorres727@gmail.com::For the record people Mayo has a AC injury.I think he should rest, but seriously he's a big factor when healty
tennisfanatic0123::This is Dallas best chance at finally reaching .500 cause they play the Suns next and if they want any little shot they have at making play offs they gotta beat the Suns. they just have to.
f1atsp1der::They're not making playoffs unless Utah completely collapse but its unlikely. Need to get to .500 to save their dignity and shave.
sworthin117::then they can finally shave their beards...
Kobelies247::Utah win today = Dallas fail!
tgreen21::He's a clipper fan... But close

MTorres727@gmail.com::Damit 6 pts for Dirk?I was so excited when he came back.I thought he was gonna go down with KD and Carmelo for that scoring title.
wunderrr::he had some great games lately and some bad ones
Kobelies247::only dallas fans would be excited about beating Portland...
FanofTexas38::Just shut up.
Kobelies247::Truth hurts i know
LetsGoMavs-::Just shave those beards in Phoenix!
MTorres727@gmail.com::And lose to Denver and fall 39-40?
scottpilgrim35::Man if only Utah didn't beat Golden State on the road tonight
DoyerBlue32::Wow can't believe I had to go through that for a Dallas cover.  Thanks Matrix~

LETS.GET.WEIRD::right?!
mrhog1::mayo almosr single  handedly lost another game....dude sucks
kornival::yea, but alridge single handely beat the blazers
joyhussain::I cant believe the Mavs beat Portland in a Playoff Series 2 years ago
cubsfan33442::I think that was 3 years ago and the Blazers only have 2 players from that team; Aldridge and Batum.
cubsfan33442::Never mind,  you were right.
