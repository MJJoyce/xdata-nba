mosesbyu::Free Jimmer.
ballsohard55.55::Lillard owns that $@% fredette all day. #weberstisbeast
Rbullenut::He owned him last night. Jimmer will be out of the league soon.
sklater::Nah.  Jimmer was doing well, then got benched again.  Lillard owns the Kings, not Jimmer.  The kings are really a shi**y team.
DucksRUNpac12-v2.0::Blazer bench actually had a decent game, yet still get destroyed by the kings, only 19 points. I think Portland is in for a long season, but still had a good game tonight.
OFrog::Let's blame the coach, it's Smart's fault. No it's Westphal's fault, or Theus, or Natt, or Musselman. Or it might just be the Maloof's minimum wage strategy. They gave up fielding a contender, even a winner long ago. You get what you pay for when you shop at the clearance rack at Walmart in the NBA.
GeorgeTownMan29::Keith Smart has to be one of the worst coaches
the departed movie theatre scene::timberwolves bench better than both these teams starters.
afronius7::I think you have that wrong. Blazers starters better than TWolves starting 5.
Jimmywilson33::Sacramento fuckking blows dickk... I got crushed earlier so I put in a long shot 4 team parlay Duke, USC, San Antonio , and of course the fuckking Kings. Thanks a lot for the great performance tonight guys u no good fuckking niggggas. Maloof brothers should pay me out on this bet for throwing games especially for throwing it at home in front of ur home fans
TheRydog3::Maybe you shouldn't bet....
NW-Prophet82::Worse possible record for us Blazers is 3-79 now. That's 3 wins at the NBA level!!!! Yes!!!!!!
UO2012::Good win, granted it was against Sac. Damian still on the path to ROY. Bench still needs alot of work.
127decibels::We have a bench?
BillWaltonsHair::No.
eazyt_971::wow thx to SAC for passing on Lillard
ChargersFan4Life001::lakerfresh is a joke lol
Minnysota Vikings::The Blazers might have the worst bench in the NBA
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::ughhh that dumb Rondo Bricks troll is on that Laker board talking about the Celtics, NO SURPRISE! -__-
Go Wolves1::shutup
Go Wolves1::shutup
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::wtf?  are you still mad?? LOL
ChargersFan4Life001::lol lakerfresh
BayTown29::Is that idiot on the Lakers board?  I mess with that guy so much.
ChargersFan4Life001::yep lol, he's fun to make fun of. A huge joke
ChargersFan4Life001::I loved the  "I would have made that shot -Bynum" comment
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::haha
Go Wolves1::Seattle Raptors
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::that's pretty catchy
calvintheidiot::FIRE SMART
calvintheidiot::wow this is actually pissing me off
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::what?
BayTown29::?
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::Seattle needs a team but which one?
UO2012::whoever moves to Seattle will become the Supersonics.
BayTown29::Clippers. Dont need 2 in LA.
BayTown29::Well they should change the name if they move.
ChargersFan4Life001::I agree
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::that's a good choice as well, The Seattle Clippers, ehhhhh.
ChargersFan4Life001::Wolves
ChargersFan4Life001::lol wolves no need to be mad
Go Wolves1::stfu boogie, stop slurping beza
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::i agree
Go Wolves1::Celtics
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::sorry but no. Celtics are set in stone.
BayTown29::What I don't understand is I thought the Kings were getting the new arena.....Didn't Kevin Johnson and them have that meeting and agree on a deal?
ChargersFan4Life001::the maloofs f---d them up
ChargersFan4Life001::the football team I like has Norv as HC the basketball team I like has the Maloofs as owners and Smart as coach Thank god the padres got new owners
BayTown29::Yeah Im pretty sure one of the brothers lost the Palms Casino they had lol
ChargersFan4Life001::yep, we do. It's sickening how horrible they are. No care for the kings fans or the city. They are broke bums
BayTown29::Kings fans must despise the Maloofs.
Lalau88::I don't expect Jimmer to ever be a star in the NBA, but it was nice to see him have a good game tonight.
jrmydavis::You're right.  He'll never be a star as long as he is stuck on Sacramento's bench.  Smart tried to bury him in the depth chart.
Go Wolves1::Pierce sucks, KG hasn't been good for a while....both are washed up
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::I guess you didn't see KG's performance in the playoffs this year huh??? Were you too busy sulking that your team didn't make the playoffs along with K-Love?
Go Wolves1::If what? Oh wait you now that in reality, the C's would be a 6 seed in the West
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::and the Celtics would have never gotten injured last year if yada yada yada.
Go Wolves1::Yes they would moron, Love and Rubio would never have got hurt, because they would have had a different schedule
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::ummm no they would not be a 3 seed last year.
Go Wolves1::Yes last year?
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::Last year??? okay
Go Wolves1::Beza, are you really that stupid? The Wolves would be a top 3 seed in the East, don't give me that shit
ChargersFan4Life001::http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zuK8dOZ08ts/SFLCeQJoG2I/AAAAAAAAATA/zyMKp6TTqD8/s400/paulama.jpg lololol
BayTown29::The Gasol brothers LOL. Is that Marc?
ChargersFan4Life001::lol
BayTown29::I know I was saying the other one was his brother lol
ChargersFan4Life001::no its an older pau, comparing him to a llama
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::C's have 5 players in the voting ballot, pretty dope.
schubes05::KG is still better than all of the other centers in the east at 36.
ChargersFan4Life001::rondo should start
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::mos def
Go Wolves1::Only 1 deserves to go
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::wtf????  KG and Pierce deserve to come off the bench.
sjabruning::Start Robinson. He is so much more talented than Hayes. The Kings arent going to the playoffs, let the young guys play together.
ChargersFan4Life001::its usually JT and DMC, hayes started for cuz. but he is gonna start in the future
willwarner12::Coach Smart and the rest of the Kings staff needs to show Cousins what happens when he's not able to play...He will have a better attitude then.BOOGIE don't like to lose.
Go Wolves1::Boogie, Christian Ponder for Phil Rivers?
BayTown29::I like Ponders new smoking hot girlfriend though.
ChargersFan4Life001::i didnt know he got a hot new gf
ChargersFan4Life001::rivers
Go Wolves1::Deal?
BayTown29::Still I'd rather have Rivers then the Great Alex Smith.
ChargersFan4Life001::Rivers has been turnover prone, but the OL has hurt that
49ersGoat::Enjoy your 400 yard games.  We'll enjoy being playoff relevant.
ChargersFan4Life001::Rivers on the 9ers and they are in the playoffs still
BayTown29::Ummmm....I'm a 9er fan.
ChargersFan4Life001::~~~~~~_¦ ¦¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¦   ~~~__¦¦¦¦ LA Lakers Bandwagon   ___¦¦¦¦¦¦ Destination: 3-79   ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦_____________________________¦   ¯(@)¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(@)(@)¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯(@)(@)¯¯? hahahahahaha
Kobelies247::going go paste this on laker boards :)
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::That late game execution is only gonna get worse for the Lakers when D'Antoni starts coaching.
ChargersFan4Life001::and the defense will get worse
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::oh no doubt
Go Wolves1::DMC wants out of Sac Town
ChargersFan4Life001::too bad he is staying
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::we'll take him
BayTown29::I dont think Cousins should have been suspended anyway. Who cares? Sean Elliot is a moron.
schubes05::Sean Elliot is a homer.
willwarner12::Which he didn't I was reading all over the place trying to see what he did...NEVER hit anyone.
willwarner12::It made no sense...They suspended him for getting in a "heated" argument with a commentator
ChargersFan4Life001::Unless he hit the guy, i dont get it
ChargersFan4Life001::yeah, I wasnt a fan of that suspension
ChargersFan4Life001::I think he has some bad pictures of the owner and GM, that has to be the reason
BayTown29::Lol I dont understand how hes held on to the job this long.
ChargersFan4Life001::he should have been gone years ago, and it is tough
BayTown29::Must be a tough times being a Charger fan. You think Norv should be fired?
ChargersFan4Life001::best 3-5 team ever -espn
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::fuckkk espn
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::heck yea, their analysts are objective
ChargersFan4Life001::yeah F them, NBA TV is way better
Dexter Pittman Number 1 Fan::Decisions Psychiatrist. Dam decisions is going to have another mental breakdown
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::LMFAO
ChargersFan4Life001::if kobe shot that, it wouldn't have hit the rim
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::Dogs, you are spreading lies.  Nobody was saying right now, we were talking about all time. Don't try to switch it up just because you got OWNED.
willwarner12::KG was better in his prime^ but not any more
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::that's what i've been trying to tell him!
Go Wolves1::I said "if you morons think KG is better than Love, stop talking to me" or something like that, Idk, and you guys were all like "KG is wayyy better"
Dexter Pittman Number 1 Fan::Lmao Decision's psychiatrist  is on the Lakers board
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::haha i saw that
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::LMFAO!
ChargersFan4Life001::hahahaha
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::ROTFL!!!!!!!!
ChargersFan4Life001::It's a good day when the lakers lose
BayTown29::Cant believe Gasol shot that LOL  Just terrible
Go Wolves1::boogie, KG or KLove? Idk why, but these clowns are forcing me to ask you
schubes05::Love will never be better than KG-try putting up 24-14-6-2-2 while being the best defender in the league.
ChargersFan4Life001::today? Love is better careers? KG
ChargersFan4Life001::yes, he needs to get it in check
BayTown29::His behavior is still a problem.
ChargersFan4Life001::dmc has the potential
BayTown29::Career- KG Now - Love Future- Boogie
Go Wolves1::K, they said they would take KG over Love today, and I was the wtf?
ClydeTheGlide_22::Yes the Lakers lose again! :)
Dexter Pittman Number 1 Fan::lol what did Gasol do?

ChargersFan4Life001::shot a 3 lol
Dexter Pittman Number 1 Fan::Lol what a fail
BayTown29::Gasol   LOLOLOLOLOL
