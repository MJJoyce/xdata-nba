tomahawksbraves::Why do jenkins and scott not play more. They will play 20+mins one game and get a DNP-coaches decision the next. Both of the last 2 ATL coaches have not known how to play rookies.
Dathoofan33::I am not sure, but you would think that the staff would be able to find time for them. Both = instant offense.
ccvuhoopster31::John Jenkins, who helped Vanderbilt beat UK last yr 2 win SEC Tourney, &amp; was the MVP, indeed, can knock 'em down. Saw him do it 3 yrs @ VU....&amp; as a rookie, it's only gonna get better!!! I'm ready; r u??
Dikembe_Mutombo_Throwback_ATLanta_Hawks_Jersey::back2back 20+ point scoring games....I know I'm ready!
pico2013::Sorry Sixers fans, Bynum was at the barber shop getting his moustache trimmed.  How does Ed Stefanki not fired for trading Vuceic  and Harkless. Dayum Sixers gave away the best center in the League for years and years to come for literally NOTHING.
Entourage19050::Because Rod Thorn did that deal before he left
Dikembe_Mutombo_Throwback_ATLanta_Hawks_Jersey::Rookies  John Jenkins: 21 pts Mike Scott: 17 pts  THESE GUYS NEED TO KEEP GETTING PLAYING TIME
Jonathan120473::Jmgugfu
phillyman08::The fans still get big macs hahaha
Texans_Knicks_2008::LOL 56 COMMENTS ON THIS WHOLE BOARD. No offense, but thats sad, especially for a playoff bound team
phillyman08::philly fans are all on the phillies board. I'm guessing ATL fans are on the braves board.
LetsGoAtlantaHawks::shove it tanking bulls
Lt. Dengerous::lol
the hawks is the word::John Jenkins is going to be a beast in this league soon
vandybo123::And Mike Scott
the hawks is the word::matter of fact Teague Jenkins Horford FUTURE
cflip37::Just let holdiay rest for towards the end, its over and he's out fuel
Podiceps::you win the "most confusing comment of the day" award.  congrats!
Linda33763::Holday  don't have clue on how to lead. Just a selfish black hold. And want to DW,and NY. what a joke
cory hanna::Sixers need to tank the 2013-14 season. We need Wiggins!!!!
cflip37::Yup getting AL jeff will asure that
phillyman08::knowing the sixers they'll get back to a 7-8 seed next year, lose in the 1st round and get a mediocre pick just like always
NBA544::Lets do it hawks. We can make it to the ECF!
Brian S is amazing::Hopefully
Love Boobies::Trick Question: A girl with big butt, but no boobss or big boobss with  no butt?

NBA544::Big butt!
airicad::insane game by josh tonight.
phillyman08::thad is doing even better. Hawks as a team though obviously much better
RHaley57::Only god knows why I would be ignorant enough to bet 76ers +3.5. Might as well wipe my a$$ with my money and flush it.
phillyman08::why would you ever bet in favor of the sixers?!?
airicad::the holiday is over
Podiceps::well, at least he's only 22.  He's got Thad and a bunch of...stuff.  His back is just sore from carrying this team for half the season.  He gets doubled almost every time he touches the ball.  Who is going to take the heat off of him?  Turner?!?
23germany::one of 10 worst all stars ever
23germany::phi one of 10 hopeless teams without a single top 50 player  this team wont matter until at least 2018
DoItForKevinWare::holiday is top 50
phillyman08::and thad should be top 50 I think. But yeah, they have a long way to go
timbdickson::#freemikescott
Rumpledilskin::Mike Scott and John Jenkins have really come along well. These guys are showing a lot of promise.
airicad::so josh came back from his injury deciding to actually make his free throws... i'll take that.

The Gas Can::Are the Hawks going to let the 76ers shoot 16-22 in the first qtr again? LOLOLOL
Dikembe_Mutombo_Throwback_ATLanta_Hawks_Jersey::I dont care what happens....as long as we get the Pacers in the 1st round......they are trash and we have owned them up until the last 2 games.....one in which we played horrible got down by like 25 and still almost won lol.
