D Wade Fan Since The 04-05 Season::RunTheBall22_-_  Pierce gave Lebron a lesson on how do the step back jumper and he still couldn't pull it off. lets go Lebron that lesson couldn't have got anymore up close and personal  Heat-Heat-Heat-Heat-Heat-Heat-Heat-Heat-Heat-Heat-Heat-Heat  Pierce can't give a lesson to Lebron. Pierce 44% as a forward against defenses before the Celtic big 3. Took him 4 years with the big 3 before he could become efficient on offense.
RunTheBall22_-_::he schooled Lebron on that play. deal with it
RunTheBall22_-_::you got emotional from that little post with an lol at the end? looks like you just got owned
D Wade Fan Since The 04-05 Season::You're starting to get emotional. Convo discontinued.
RunTheBall22_-_::never said it did. said he schooled him and you seem to be having a hard time dealing with that. lol
D Wade Fan Since The 04-05 Season::One play does not make a player better. Sorry!
RunTheBall22_-_::Spo after the game--- I like the play we got off, i figure if we send Battier out to half court he would be open and sure enough he was. just have to hit that shot. as for Lebron he did what he always does in that situation, nothing.
Djuki 3::hmmm something tells me that didn't come from a credible source
RunTheBall22_-_::it's a real quote
Aicyla22::he forgot to put FACT which means its not really true
Fear the Gr0nk::lol sorry heat fans, I may not have much more sh*t to talk this year.  Got to get it out while I can.
FinsCanesHeat030324::isnt the heats current record of 28-13 the score of the AFC championship game?
