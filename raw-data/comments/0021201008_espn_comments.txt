JHC88.8::McRoberts may have a future in Charlotte...He is playing well
pantherfan2488::His numbers would go down if we got a true center, but yes he will do nicely to be resigned.
jack_the_baller::going from the heat board to this one is so peacefull people saying good game haha this is awsome
sunderland13::I drove up from Buffalo for the game in Toronto. Have to say Air Canada Center is really really nice and the fans were all good sports too. Respect for the Raptors organization. Will be rooting for them if they sneak in the playoffs

9edr0::im gonna go watch this show called My Strange Addiction one of the people drinks blood....kinda creepy (its on TLC)
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Weirdest one I saw on that show is a chick ate the stuffing out of couches and it alamost killed her. The show literally saved her life. It was all stored in her guts, and what had broken down had released toxins all over her body.
MoneyWeems2477::he just pulled a tony romo
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::What is the score
MoneyWeems2477::93-86 heat
MoneyWeems2477::Heat on a 39-6 run
CharlotteGator32::Come on man Lebron is just a monster
MoneyWeems2477::lebron-refs=Josh Smith
MoneyWeems2477::and by heat i mean the refs
CharlotteGator32::Just unbelievable lol
MoneyWeems2477::Raptors sucked ever since the harlem shake video
gri400::i blame Amir getting rid of the claw cut, if he had kept it we would be fighting for the 2 seed right now
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::What's the chances that the same Ref crew, That woman would miss two obvious calls at the end of 2 games that affected the outcome of 2 games between the same 2 teams.  JUST ANOTHER NBA COINCIDENCE
pantherfan2488::oh pleaaaase, why in the world would the nba care to sway a crew in a bobcats game...now look at the heat coming back improbably, that is just cray
AvengedByCats::And you need to cool down.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::And?
TCluvcarpanthers::He's a Bobcat fan.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Go suck LeBrons D on that board. No one cares about the Heat here.
CoolRod365::Need to keep Mullens next season
bobcats375::hell no. shots way tooooo much for a power forward.  hes a 6' 11" shooting guard. and hes streaky a crap
hokies63::true that
tmoneyinmphs::Rudy couldn't get toronto past the slobcats?
hokies63::you need to be quiet, may i remind you that yal were the ONLY team last year in our   7-59 season TWICE. so who are the slobs now!
gri400::please ignore the grizz trolls :)
pantherfan2488::Imagine the implosion on ESPN this weekend if Charlotte beat Miami...the site would be down for days.
hokies63::i saw on sportscenter earlier this week, achart on the percentage of te miami heat keeping there steark alive against their next 4 opponnets, it said Bobcats, only a 53% chance so we got a chance
9edr0::probably gonna loose by 20....but the question is who will loose by 20
Indychase22897::dolan
Indychase22897::pls
9edr0::that would be epic lol
gri400::i love the idea of this, i'll be cheering for a bobcats win
Indychase22897::Yeahhhhhhh!!!! Bobcats win!!!! Screw Toronto!!! Bobcats just tooooo goood! 2 in a row!!!!!!!     Had to, don't get to brag much. Good Game Toronto.
hokies63::remember when we were 7-5, and we were on top of the world
MoneyWeems2477::Good game my dog
RaptorsBasketballRTZ::LeBron is too much...booing him will get worse
tmoneyinmphs::Better watch out toronto.  The lame $@% wizards might pass ya for that tenth spot.
TCluvcarpanthers::NBA Championship?
AGirlThatLovesSports_::2 GAME WIN STREAK 2 GAME WIN STREAK.
aburks181::i just cant wait to see the bobcats in like3 more years..they should purposefully do bad to keep getting a top 5 draft pick and then they will be amazing
9edr0::yea should be solid...Toronto should be solid also Gay and DeRozen are studs
gri400::GG everybody.
TCluvcarpanthers::GG.
arvinramroop::GG Bobcat's fans
MoneyWeems2477::As long as Cavs win, i dont care we lost
ignasm::heat came back huge, no way they lose now
gri400::don't care that we lost regardless, makes no difference for us really
9edr0::GG Toronto
arvinramroop::GG
patrickallen92::i turn the game back on only to watch mcroberts and mullens clinch the game for the bobcats....damn
gri400::that mullens guy is just too talented for any one team to stop, just not meant to be
jack_the_baller::go cats
arvinramroop::REFS WIN AGAIN
pantherfan2488::Boohoo, there was no missed foul call at the buzzer this time
AGirlThatLovesSports_::lol.
9edr0::Toronto is like 24-24 on the FT line
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::It's the ones that are clearly no called moron
9edr0::the Charlotte Bobcats the only NBA team with 2 PF white guys that can ball
Ihavenointegrityandalanternjaw::.
Talentsojhin::I think DIrk counts as two.
TCluvcarpanthers::ITS OVER BYRON MULLLLLLLLLLLENS ENDS IT
gri400::sign him to a new contract before he goes and forms a new big 3 with another team
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::This is the game that Mullens and McRoberts tell their grand kids about.
9edr0::those refs psh letting Miami get back in it
arvinramroop::ITS NOT OVER TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS
9edr0::she is eating a taco ATM she is getting ready
gri400::<i> he's just too talented and clutch </i>
MoneyWeems2477::Lebron hits two threes in a row to tie it
ignasm::ye, crazy comeback in 4 minutes
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Mullens is the ugliest man ever Jesus what a mug
gri400::we fouled mullens out of fear, not because of the time and score
9edr0::probably could have made him turn it over
gri400::we were scared and panicked, i'm sure it happens often with him
arvinramroop::FIELDS
9edr0::oh man Miami is making a come back
TCluvcarpanthers::I wish we had Cardiac Kemba :(
arvinramroop::clutch amir
MoneyWeems2477::The miami refs making a huge comeback
MoneyWeems2477::its tied
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Jesus. I think we just saw why JV sits on the bench for the final 5-10 minutes of a game. McRoberts takes two rebounds from him. That was SUPER SOFT. Had a vision of Bargs.  Double A riding the pine all 4th is absolutely unacceptable as well.
gri400::kleiza for the game tying 4 pointer... make it happen casey
ignasm::he's actually good for those big shots
gri400::yep, if anyone on the team could have hit it i'd have him as one of my top choices  That is honestly sad though
9edr0::lol that would be crazy
gri400::casey disappointed me here :(
AGirlThatLovesSports_::NOOO!!!!!!!!
jaykel0621::Damnit can't get the board
AGirlThatLovesSports_::JOSH MCBOB!!!!!
