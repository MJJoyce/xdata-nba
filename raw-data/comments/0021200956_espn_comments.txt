nicholas197830::Way to go Heat winning 20 in a row.  I like how you finally has as many wins as the Spurs.  Try being like the Spurs and win games resting four of your starters.
MiamiFloridians::Lakers are garbage and so is Kobe, I remember their fans actually believing that they will beat the Heat this year, so far 0-2 bottom of the western conference which the Heat have totally dominated.
smokingstogies305::You know you sound like a moron when you call an alltime great garbage right. Use a fact to back what you say. What could you possibly say to back the statement "Kobe is Garbage"
RepeatHeat_Umad::Haven't been here since the playoffs last year and I see people are still hating on LJ ...lol
Calvin9299::There's the Miami Heat, then there's the remaking seven seed hopefuls.  Twenty straight is quite a accomplishment. That's a streak, unlike the "so called" streak by the Blackhawks of the NHL.    Too many teams make the playoffs in both sports, Atleast in the NBA like the remaining majors, its predicated solely on wins. This is again..., quite a streak.   Miami is likely the only team from its conference with a chance to win the NBA title.  Seeds 2 through 8 as they sit now are either struggling due to injury, or mediocre play with the loss columns ranging from 24, (2seed) to 31, (8seed). Not one of these teams truly compares to Miami.
BigBadLakers420::I hope Lebron tears his acl!
The God of Trolls Returns for the 7th Time::I hope Kobe does too!
DrJack76::Tim Duncan has done something that Lebron, Kobe, Dwyane,Melo, and Durant will never do in their careers.  He has lead his team to at least 50 wins for 13 straight years.  The only year he did not was 1998-1999 in which they only played a 50 game season due to the strike and they had the best record in the league that year and won their first title.  Talk about consistency.
DrJack76::Did not know Phil Jackson participated in these forums?  I guarantee that you would not have a problem if Lakers won the championship in a shortened season.  Spurs  won championships in full seasons also.  Spurs have made the playoffs every year Duncan has been there.  Can't say that for Kobe.   To bring in two hall of famers to help Kobe and still struggle to make the playoffs?  How many hall of famers have the Spurs brought in to help Timmy?  None.
BigBadLakers420::Yet they never defended not one of their titles...weak! Lakers are the team of that decade and tied with Dallas as those are the only two teams that won a champioship this decade, a full season champioship this decade.
BigBadLakers420::All the Heat fans are trolling on the Laker boards right now...LOL
BigBadLakers420::Wow..no trolls on this board! Nobody cares about Miami Heat!
BigBadLakers420::Its too bad for the Heat the Lakers hold just about every record there is in the NBA. Same for individual stats as well.
DrJack76::Didn't the Spurs win 20 straight last year?
MiamiFloridians::Where the Spurs defending NBA Champions last year ?
--Td4mvp3 -::GO SPURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 50 WINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)
nyktofinals01::I'm thinking Miami is going to lose to Toronto on Sunday on purpose to avoid having their streak ended on Monday by the Celtics. The only team in the east that is not scared of the heat are the Celtics, and if Miami's streak ends on Monday rather than Sunday, they have no shot at the title this year.
MiamiFloridians::Miami will sweep any one of those teams man, Celtics have lost to the Heat 2 straight years in the playoffs with much better teams than they have this season.
kenle0746::"When you have a streak like this, you have to have some luck," James said.  it's called having Refs on your side all the time..
VikingsForLife21::Even if you don't like the Heat, you've gotta be either a homer or a flat out idiot to still not appreciate their success.
sports18fan::That's definitely true, but... even if you don't like the Spurs, you've gotta be either a homer or a flat out idiot to still not appreciate their success.
BigBadLakers420::Bull crap! Miami had a lot of home cooking from the refs for Lebron!
MiamiFloridians::Miami is 13th in the NBA in ft's
UMiami1994::Now there is a honest  smart person.
LeBronHasNoFullSeasonRing::The truth:  http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=300511005

GaspoMinnyFan981::Definitely
--Td4mvp3 -::its probably cuz he plays in such a small market yunno
koke2013::Strasburg vs Nolasco  Smh lol
brandonlee561heat22::Two aces!
brandonlee561heat22::Prolly in like 3 innings
koke2013::I heard Nolasco gave up four runs the other day lol
--Td4mvp3 -::If Romo was an unrestricted FA you guys what take him in a second and wouldnt think twice...hes that good!
koke2013::I wouldn't even take him for a 3rd
--Td4mvp3 -::hmmm
--Td4mvp3 -::I really hope the Cowboys win it all next year...we really had all the pieces but injuries to our defense and o-line made winning games impossible
koke2013::You guys still need a QB
koke2013::Lol he's far from underrated
--Td4mvp3 -::Romo is the most underrated QB in the league every year....yea hes chocked alot but the talents there
