coachhadly::Kevin Love&gt;Demarcus Cousins&gt;Blake Griffin.  Griffin is several years in and has the best set-up man in the world playing with him, and yet he doesn't dominate on a consistent basis.  The only thing he does well is dunk.  Love is light years better and since January, Cousins has now passed him too.
USANIGERIA::Great win for my second favorite team. Cousins is talented, but he has a $@%!-poor attitude.
helgedalen::Kevin Love &gt; Blake Griffen

TitanG545::Uh Kobe is in LA, I think you mean the Kobe on the Clippers.
Kennyprager::The Clippers are in LA too????
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pt::It's all about Kobe guys and clippers suck. He is better then Michael Jordan. I love you Kobe even though I am a man and I get wet thinking about you.
Sir_Volan::Whoa, I love Kobe as well but come on man. That's like saying Crosby is better than Gretzky.

BeeBopWatts::Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts Is the biggest Kobefanboy ever.
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::clippers are garbage
tandyman8::Just for all the Blake Griffin haters who say he can't do anything but dunk.. he made back to back clutch 20 footers in this game.
Sir_Volan::sorry sir, but you need more than one game to be considered skilled. What elite team has he shot jumpers well against? Lol, he helps beat the kings and he's got more game now? Hype Griffin if he can ever win a division. Plus, it's a lot easier to hit jumpers when people dont expect you to shoot and are concentrating on the best PG in the game. Without Paul, Griffin would be out of the playoffs again.
paulpi3rce34::lol you compare his shot to birds and dirk WTF R U TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!!
TitanG545::He really has a nice shot, he should work on it more. I compare his release to Dirk or Bird, good lord they are ugly.  I dare mention Bill Cartwrights shot, DANG it was UGLY.
Kennyprager::Re: Shawn Marion.....You mean his face or his shot?
Sir_Volan::Shawn Marion?
mirecat 917::Kmart should shoot more threes saturday.
CamGoingHAM::Sorry,but San Diego is too soft,might sound like a broken record but they lose close games all the time
GO_PADRES_GO::If they don't change that then they have no shot

bobbyshaww::clippers doing great this year about the lakers and clippers game clippers was down 13 and came back even tho they lost it was a great effort by the clippers i even enjoyed gasol getting dunk on twice
mirecat 917::yea, this guy has been posting this ever since last night
CamGoingHAM::Why only Sessions highlights?
GO_PADRES_GO::Cam, I thought you said you were a Bulls fan? Are you a Clipper fan also or what?
CamGoingHAM::Kansas City will be tough next season with Jamal Charles,bet they win the division. They'll do good with a weak AFC schedule.
CamGoingHAM::Panthers are going to k.ill the Chargers next season,can't wait till they release the schedule so I can get my tickets to the game
convolutedthought::lol san diego is going nowhere..esp with manning joing denver and oakland being better...sd is disappointing
PadresChargersClippers::The only team that the chargers should remotely be afraid of is the chiefs, broncos overpaid for Manning who sucks against SD and Oakland is uhhhhh, not doing so well right now, dealing with cap issues that is.
GO_PADRES_GO::Raiders don't have a shot, the Broncos are overrated. Not saying SD will win it but it's not like we have no shot
CamGoingHAM::I'm a fan of Blake Griffin since I meet him at the Dunk Contest a few years ago when I was 17,not a Clippers fan I bleed Red and Black
PadresChargersClippers::Not to get away from basketball but what do you think of the 2012-13 chargers team so far?
GO_PADRES_GO::me too
PadresChargersClippers::Hopefully, I love the Eddie Royal pickup.
GO_PADRES_GO::also need Rivers to bounce back
GO_PADRES_GO::eh, they made some improvements but losing Vjax and Tolbert hurts. We need to draft a pass rush
CamGoingHAM::Luke Ridnour would start on most teams in the NBA and he's not even the best PG on the team for the T-Wolves
convolutedthought::lol...ok then trade cp3 for luke and wes johnson hahaha
PadresChargersClippers::LOL Ridnour is a backup PG.
CamGoingHAM::12.4 ppg,5 assists ............... back-up
GO_PADRES_GO::Give it up

lakerfan23923::so my guess is your 15-18 years old.
laxfiles::nothing personal, but your side trolls insanely hard. I gotta put my work in to even it out.
GO_PADRES_GO::lmao @ saying Love has more talent around him than BG. The BEST PG in the NBA
PadresChargersClippers::Hey Padres, we get it Love is the best, can we move on?
GO_PADRES_GO::Go Ahead
CamGoingHAM::He does,Derrick Williams,Michael Beasley,Wesley Johnson,I can go on and on
CamGoingHAM::Ridnour and Barea are both good
GO_PADRES_GO::Wes Johnson? really? CP3, Butler, Mo williams &gt;&gt; Dwill, Beasley, Wes
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::HAHAHA WHERE WAS THE CLIPPER FANS LAST NIGHT??? NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. HAHAHAHAHA GARBAGE
sambecker1::you're garbage.
PadresChargersClippers::Having a life outside of ESPN conversation boards?
CamGoingHAM::It's Blake's team first before Paul's,they both are the leaders on this team though.
convolutedthought::lol keep thinking that..its cp3's team
DaftShadow::I think they should raise the basketball court 3ft higher thanks to Blake Griffin.
TitanG545::Do you mean the basketball rim, the court would just be 3 extra feet to walk up.
GO_PADRES_GO::BG is good, but overrated and overhyped. He has dunks that are top 5 on SC that would get ignored if a team like the kings did them.
convolutedthought::agree i am tired of BG
PadresChargersClippers::Kobescored62points guy is so $@%!$@% stupid it's ridiculous hahahaha
sambecker1::i think that means he's angry.
sambecker1::woah, can you like read the future or something hahaha
PadresChargersClippers::Yeah, now were probably going to hear about how Kobe is the greatest, clippers are irrelevant, Blake Griffin likes to dunk and espn likes him, and Sessions is better than CP3.
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::CLIPPER FANS UNITE!!!
Utah-Hawaii-Alum::Lube up your brown eye and ease in the Pepperige Farm summer sausage bro!
sambecker1::must suck to have no friends.
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::HAHAHAHA MUST SUCK TO BE A CLIPPER FAN
sambecker1::stop liking your own comments. you already look like a big enough tool.
PadresChargersClippers::looks like he found the caps button.
sambecker1::tell me about it. scum of the earth.
GO_PADRES_GO::it's also funny how you say the clips are a terrible franchise(which they are), but the wolves and blazers have been making picks a lot worse.
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::BLAZERS WERE GOOD LAST DECADE
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::YES LAST DECADE. WHEN WE'RE THE CLIPPERS EVER RELEVENT?? 2006????
GO_PADRES_GO::last decade
GO_PADRES_GO::Love was on his way to making the playoffs when Rubio went down
convolutedthought::lol cp3 is way better than all the players on loves team...and clippers were winning more cuz of chauncy too
CamGoingHAM::But he's so good, Rubio really means that much to them? A rookie shooting around 37% with a high turnover rate? He has plenty of talent still around him in Minnesota,he has better players on his team than Blake does. Blake has CP3,Caron,and Mo Williams who is streaky,Kevin has Michael Beasley,Derrick Williams,Pekovic,Webster,etc.
CamGoingHAM::Funny thing is people talking about Blake not being able to post up and score, neither can LeBron and he's in his 9th season in the NBA. The only thing is LeBron can hit 3's and is a bigger threat when being isolated because of speed,strength.Blake will develop a 18 foot jump shot, he works too hard not to get better at the little things,he's strong and will develop quick post moves to destroy his match-up in a few years.
convolutedthought::lol Blake is the NBA joke...i will be shocked if he learns any moves next year other than dunking
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::Or get injured again from flopping to much
BroncoTom10::<b> Clippers with Blake Griffin: <u>32-50</u>  Clippers with Chris Paul: Winning team. </b>
PadresChargersClippers::Having said that, Chris Paul has turned this team around.
mirecat 917::haha. True
PadresChargersClippers::Plus in the east 32-50 is good enough for the 3rd spot.
mirecat 917::SARCASM
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::LOL DUMBA.SS DON'T YOU REALIZE HIS FIRST YEAR THEY HAD TO PLAY 82 GAMES?
PadresChargersClippers::That was his first year?
8mac22::I'm pretty sure he only won because of his dunks. Other than that, he is a mediocre player
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::HE WAS ROOKIE OF THE YEAR WASN'T HE???
PadresChargersClippers::So earlier we were comparing PGs now we're doing PFs?
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::Lol Blake didn't even get invited to play with the USA B TEAM
sambecker1::he's one of the finalists you idiot.
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::LOL BUT DID HE PLAY??? NO
Billywhiterock::People seem to forget IT is not the go to option on the Kings like Irving on the Cavs. Irving will likely win ROY , but Thomas should be runner up
convolutedthought::i agree IT is good but irving is playing better
CamGoingHAM::Blake Griffin's a winner,he took a horrible Sooners team to the Elite 8 with his horrible brother as the second best player on the team in college. In his second year in the NBA he's on his way to the playoffs with one of the most dysfunctional franchises in NBA History, it's not like Aldridge,Love,and other great bigs who have come into this league can say they have done what Blake is doing or has done already.
convolutedthought::lol all BG does it dunk haha and most times its an offensive foul but isnt called...BG will be the NBA joke
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::Um Kevin love has been on a crappy team.
PadresChargersClippers::Apparently putting up 20/10 means you aren't very good.
GO_PADRES_GO::BG also has the best pg in the NBA Love &gt; LA &gt; BG
convolutedthought::lol...the only reason clips are in is because of cp3 not blake...
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::We all can agree on one thing. F.uck the Heat and F.uck Lebitch James
BroncoTom10::"Ain't no moral victories around here," Paul said. "They won the game, and that's that."  "It was exciting," Paul said, "but at the end of the day, we lost. Who cares?" ----- If only Clippers fans thought this way. They're all still getting their panties wet from the dunks... "OMG BG IS THE BEST PF EEEVER, WHO CARES ABOUT DEFENSE AND SKILL!!!"
mirecat 917::I definitaly agree with paul.
GO_PADRES_GO::Cam is just a troll, he is really jealous of IT
CamGoingHAM::I really didn't know who he was until I remembered the game with him and Lin,I was just looking up game stats and wanted to show the guy who said he outplayed so many good pointguards that he's been outplayed just as much himself.
Billywhiterock::You also don't know where your pee-pee is, but get a magnifying glass and you might find it, or perhaps you have a vajayjay? lol
Crazy Red Dev1l::<strong>http://hoopsgrind.com/2012/04/04/lebron-james-vs-kevin-durant-analyzing-every-possession-part-2/  Why Lebron is the best player in the league.  Heat and Lebron fans please share. </strong>
mirecat 917::lol
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::Lol a website determines Lebron is the best player?? Iv seen it all haha
SmokeTrees773::dont u mean lebron d i c k riders who aint from miami...
mirecat 917::Where the hell did this guy come from.
GO_PADRES_GO::IT deserves more respect from espn, the only time I really saw them give him credit is when he dropped 20pts in a Q with 5 3's at MIA
PadresChargersClippers::That happens when the team is losing, Al thornton was a beast a couple years back but no one talked about him cause the clippers lost the majority of the time.
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::Clipper fans talk about the dunk even though their best player Chris Paul said he doesn't care cause they lost. HAHAHAH Pathetic.
PadresChargersClippers::What's pathetic is how riled up you're getting right now.   Its a game.....
sambecker1::yeah and you look like a tool by being in a CLIPPERS CHAT BOARD. such a $@%!$@.
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::I didn't know I'm riled up for bashing the clippers
mirecat 917::Oh yea, Chris Paul HATES to lose.
sambecker1::nope. watch an interview with him, he tries to excite his team with his dunks. know what your talking about before speaking.
mirecat 917::He had 0 tonight. Just sayin
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::But Blake gRuffin only cares about dunks haha
BroncoTom10::That's what I hate about Blake Griffin.  All he cares about is getting his highlights and personal accolades.  Blake gets the dunk, GaSOFT gets the WIN. That's why Fakers &gt; Clippers any day of the week.
SmokeTrees773::blakes a one dimensional player..whats he gunna do if he gets injured and loses hes athletic ability
CamGoingHAM::He's only in his second year and has better post moves than Dwight Howard does
CamGoingHAM::You are a complete fool to believe this, Blake has been all about winning since middle school
