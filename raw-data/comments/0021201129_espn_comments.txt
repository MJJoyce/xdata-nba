LetsGoAtlantaHawks::hawks can beat the pacers in the 1st round
liquidvizions707::at this rate we couldnt beat the bobcats. drew is right. we soft and how we can come out like we did last night is beyond me. real talk, drew.
HotdogSalesman2012::moultrie is really getting some good minutes i see. that's great doug. and thanks for another wasteful W.
mj8648::sixers should just tank and lose all remaining games.....useless trying to win and not make the playoffs....collins and mgt are idiots....players who think they still have a chance to the playoffs are idiots as well....
MJH5158::You've never played sports....what kind of mentality is playing to lose?
liquidvizions707::to get a better pick. sixers are done. it was pointless to win.

knicks_11::really shud of  traded  josh smith  hes def going to leave u atlanta fans
liquidvizions707::who cares. we win without him. and he has zero discipline. u say this like we care w t f he does and goes
jaykeia::Im a Hawks fan.But i pretty much dont care to watch them this year in the playoffs.I think they should have traded Smith away and missed the playoffs instead of making the playoffs only to be put out in the first round. But good thing we have the Braves and Falcons to cheer for in the mean time bc the Hawks need to get it together!
zracer47::woohoo, good job 76ers.  Keep your lead knicks.
liquidvizions707::what are you on about??? hawks cant catch knicks if they won out. lay down the crack pipe man

bigdaddymatty17::The Hawks are a hot steaming pile of garbage.
sffinsfan::hot steaming pile is CORRECT.....but  a four letter word  FOLLOWING THAT would have been more appropriate.LOL
sffinsfan::This  game is a "PERFECT EXAMPLE"  of why most NBA fans  KNOW  ATL  is just a bunch  underachieving bums....what an embarrassment....it takes EFFORT to play defense..are they going to let the SIXERS shoot 60% by the end of the game!..Games are won on defense  just ask SA/MIA/BOS. Pathetic!!
liquidvizions707::calm down man. it's just a game
enceladusMonster::Every game on nba is fixed to the core today... the stats (fouls, freethrows) on every game are telling the tale.

maziyarbigbaby::smith? teague is a sucks player
Joeb7853::Atlanta's going to be an easy 4 game run for someone in the first round of the playoffs.
steve_cronin61::Hawks should be drug out on to the street and shot
enceladusMonster::yeah what a rigged game.
Joeb7853::I guess the Hawks are just pretenders.
BetOrDie::Ok now it's over
pxez34a::Hawks look like they're throwing this game on purpose...it's THAT bad
bigdaddymatty17::Wow the Hawks are HOT GARBAGE. I bet any team in the East would love to feast on this team in the playoffs.
