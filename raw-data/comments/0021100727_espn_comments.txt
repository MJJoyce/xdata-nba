Rexanilatorz::ED DAVIS IS SO CLUTCH HE MADE THE PIZZA SHOT!
leerey14::GJ toronto, way to steal the sixers idea.
manning48911::if someone on the bench is getting more points in less minutes then you get while playing more minutes their is a problem
mpnaught::Check out where Orlando lands in our Power Rankings...  http://www.chicagosportslife.com/?p=3869
otownmagic4life::Howard, Anderson, Liggins, Clark - the FUTURE, everyone else is pretty much expendable
Magicmike321::JJ?
NUPE_NUPE_NUPE::Justin Harper too. He's developing.
DTangMF::Ish
yorkallday1::nba re-draft who would u guys take second? this site said kenneth faried, i don't think he's thaaat good though http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/2012/03/full-2011-nba-re-draft.html
Powemby84::the Raptors continue to be a total embarrassment to Canada -- as a BIG Steve Nash fan, I have to say, if he ever plays for Toronto, it will be VERY SAD
Jar_Jar Binks::you do realize that Toronto is ONE city in Canada --- no one out west identifies with them....any more than New Yorkers are represented by people in Beverly Hills.  You said that earlier.
DTangMF::Nelson is slowly making his way back to be another offensive threat. Now we just need Turk to step up to be ready for playoff.
ChicagoBullsFan9::http://up.liga.ir/images/6m7ux4qi4c6tyn7dvp1x.swf     is he a retired coach?
111Mauricejonesdrew111::F#*$ you that scared me
mdk1005::Free Jerroyd Bayless!!
Powemby84::anywhere would be better than the humiliation that is Toronto Raptors
adoug13::Start Redick over JRich already, and then take Turk out back and... I dunno shoot him or something, we'll be better for it.
adoug13::Or if you wanna be humane about it, teach him to juggle and sell him to the circus.
vangundyfan12::Anderson is a god.  Magic are idiots for not starting him last year.
cellus24::Dwight howard on sun sports in florida  after the win talking about catching up with miami and chicago for home court http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QnT9oUg1aY&amp;feature=channel
BowenDT71::Ah JJ Redick with a solid 12 points on 40% from downtown. I love that guy.
TheCronoMasterMind::Love how the fans were screaming when they found out they were going to get free pizza when the Raptors scored over 100. Was the highlight of their night lol. Hope the Magic keep playing like this for the rest of the season.
mwfunari@verizon.net::The magic are hot, be aware Knicks!!!!
NUPE_NUPE_NUPE::Soooooooooooooooooo, who won?
chucknorris3298293::IF YOU WANNA KNOW HOW CANADA IS,  JUST WATCH CRAPTORS PLAY
holmdog92093::it has nothing to do with proximity to toronto. we just assume that all canadians root for the raptors since they're the only canadian team. also, it makes sense that canadians would be fans of such awful basketball. stick to hockey
Powemby84::you do realize that Toronto is ONE city in Canada --- no one out west identifies with them....any more than New Yorkers are represented by people in Beverly Hills -- hopefully you have more education than you exhibit (if the words are a little large for you, use dictionary dot com)
chucknorris3298293::CRAPTORS AND CANADA.............. YUCK!
Powemby84::please stay where you are then - stay in racist , murder-obsessed USA
Masta_ Da_Magician::I would cheer for free pizza too!! Come on Blax you know we do it during Rays season..Even if the Rays are getting blown out we're cheering for them 10 Ks.
ant1078::i think they covered the spread pretty good
MagicBoltzRays::Three Stars 1. Anderson 2. Nelson 3. Howard
MagicBoltzRays::LOL. raptors cheering because they get free pizza
ant1078::LMFAO canada going crazy for free slice of pizza
Powemby84::you do realize that Toronto is a CITY, not a country......I hope some Americans are educated, but it doesn't seem so....LMAO
chucknorris3298293::WHAT WAS THIS GAME?   I MEAN IS THIS BASKETBALL.. HOW CAN U HAVE CRAPTORS TEAM IN NBA PRO SPORT.. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.   THERE WAS NO COMPEITION AT ALL
Masta_ Da_Magician::Tonight was a good warm up for the Magic.. We should destroy the Knicks on Wens now.
Jc0516::"lebron"- chokin on wades di.ck since 2010'
ant1078::its all good though, we gave u guys $@%!$@ bieber lmfao, he's better off in the states, thank  god
ant1078::stop liking ur own comments....get some dignity
chucknorris3298293::dude stop cheering for craptors lol .... get some dignity
chucknorris3298293::FUNY THING IS YOU CAN PUT MAGIC 10TH TEAM OR A HIGH SCHOOL TEAM AND CRAPTORS WILL STILL LOSE.......     NOONE SEES THAT   ;)
111Mauricejonesdrew111::funny thing is how the nba doesnt have a 10th team they only have around 15 players on a team

SportsFan8916::Will Magic beat Hawks if they face them again in the playoffs?
DTangMF::I dont think Magic can beat the Hawks in the playoff, Van Gundy is getting out coached.
SportsFan8916::Magic Have a better team but they don't perform better..and the Hawks are just a decent team..think that speaks for the Magic..or the Coaching.
Magicmike321::I hope so but I'm legidimately worried
111Mauricejonesdrew111::im not sure
Masta_ Da_Magician::Nikki Minaj is a disgusting pig..That sh*t she makes is far from music.
111Mauricejonesdrew111::oh god they have nicki minaj in canada shes spreading
Masta_ Da_Magician::Lady Gaga is better than Minaj..At least she's original..Minaj is a wannabe Lady Gaga
ant1078::lady gaga was the worst

Magicmike321::Like this if you wanna touch my wang
Magicmike321::thought so
SportsFan8916::Turk is such a bum man..when's the last time he had a 20+ point game
SportsFan8916::Exactly  the year they went to the finals..if he was as reliable and consistent as he was then, then the magic would really be a pretty tough team to face in the playoffs  that's my opinion
ant1078::probably the first time he was on orlando
Qster15::Magic rests their starter and allows the Raptors to creep.. but still win the game.. typical NBA
LeBron has commitment issues::10/21 from 3....and they are still quite back..
LeBron has commitment issues::BIGAPPLE= I LIKE MY OWN GAMBLING SPAM SO I LOOK LEGIT
Qster15::Raptors are a joke team.. they play well one day and fall apart the next. Raps GM must go.. its been too many seasons and he's done nothing but Fail to trade Bosh, Fail at drafting Bargnani over Aldridge, etc...
chucknorris3298293::CRAPTORS ;)

ant1078::looked like he got shot in his side...
ant1078::re-injured himself
LeBron has commitment issues::BIG APPLE= HAS ERECTILE DSYFUNCTION
chucknorris3298293::HAHA YOU DONT HAVE A LETDOWN AGAINST CRAPTORS NO MATER HOW HARD YOU TRY..  THERE IS A  REASON WHY ITS THE WORST FRANCHISE OF LAST 100 YEARS ;)
Masta_ Da_Magician::For all the distractions and for as inconsistent as the Magic have been all year if you would have told be they would be a solid 3 seed in the East I would have been pretty happy.. Alot of the "experts" were picking the Magic to be a 6-8 seed.
LeBron has commitment issues::the fans...the people that WATCH games....and not just espn and miami games....know this team is a 3 seed.....had i picked playoff teams to start the year...id prolly put there 3-4 seed....
ant1078::time to play some PS3
LeBron has commitment issues::we have very few back to backs left this year ...so we should be able to have more games where we are fresh like this...
Henry52378::orlando is going to have a let down
Henry52378::my team still win games who ever on the court! 40-10
Henry52378::my bulls will kick orlando $@% in the playoffs
Magicmike321::Lets see if you can field a full team first.  Your team is made of glass
Henry52378::they suck!!! orlando will never win a title
LeBron has commitment issues::by that logic there little Henry...that means until the end of their existence there little buddy.....
Magicmike321::Never?  Smart statement..  LMAO
LeBron has commitment issues::lol ok
