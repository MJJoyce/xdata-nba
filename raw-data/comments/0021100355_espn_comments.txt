1967pices::I have bet on sports for 2 years now. I have tried a few handicappers with no true luck. Just in December I started using sportsbettingstar.com . Since I have now won 22 bets with only 1 loss. It is a double down betting system but I have done better with this handicapper than with several that I have used in the past Thought I would share this with anyone out there that is not winning their sports bets

baziman 007::bynum and fillers for rondo and pierce, who says no?
Shaun0088::Who in the hell is Fillers?
Ultras South::Fakers fans are as delusional as it gets, and that is saying something..............
DNA and the I Ching::Silly Laker fans. Bynum is hardly worth what you guys seem to think he is.  You couldnt get Rondo for Bynum straight up, much less with Pierce too.
openminded43::JOKE!!!
CBass1317::Memphis is just not that good.  No Z-Bo, no Battier ...
balltillifall_88::i live in tennessee and have watched every grizz game this year. they have just had a bad run of luck so far this season. and dont forget they had won 7 in a row before this past week or 2. at the beginning of the year you had rudy gay coming back from 10 months of no basketball, and you had conley get injured. who is a HUGE part of the grizzlies. he keeps the pace and sets up the offense perfectly. then soon after conley comes back, z-bo goes down with the injury. the grizz have still played well in the last month and getting back to their style of play last year. tough gritty defense, deflections, steals, fast breaks, etc. and another thing, i love battier, but we dont NEED him. we only got him when rudy went down, and had won something like 13 out of 17 with rudy and no battier before rudy went down. as long as we can stay afloat in the playoff hunt until zbo comes back, then i believe we can make a run. its hard to replace mr first name 20 last name 10.
CBass1317::Caught lightening last year
Birdmann._.::z bo is coming back and battier doesn't do anything tony allen cant do
jeffery6803::playing with people you like helps ,truth be told none of the Celtics vets could really stand BBD and his whining act.  But going by the vets comments this season they actually like the young guys and enjoy playing with them that`s why we have a real bench this year

Bosstown Baller::PATRIOTS
quithatin1::Boston can turn it on and off, thats how good they are.
sugafreee86::its a mirage, nothing more nothing less.
CBass1317::Keep telling yourself that ...
Bosstown Baller::Banging em out
Jun360::I'm sure somewhere Grizzlies owner ( Heisley) is thinking and wishing to have rather kept Lowry for Conley. Then shot themselves more in the foot by overpaying him. Conley does not make sense for their Grit and Grind mantra , but no one can't argue Lowry brings it every night.    Just sayinn.....
CBass1317::Lowry has proven to be a total stud.  Dude is like a full back playing pg.
dpas569::i said it earlier and i'm going to say it again, the C's have been playing really good basketball the past 2 weeks. i'm glad they're making me eat my words from earlier in the season. keep it going guys and i will HAPPILY continue to eat my crow with some fava beans and a nice chianti. slurp slurp slurp slurp! GO CELTS!!!!
DNA and the I Ching::It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
bodegas15::Boston Baby! Way to Go Celtics! Haters keep hating on the veterans
robmoro78::two sundays ago all three boston sports teams won. this sunday....two down (c's/b's)....one to go (PATS)!!
autigers1989::I have said it before and I say it again.  The C's need to start playing and integrating their youth much, much more.  In the two games that Jajuan Johnson has received decent playing time he has shot 100% and 63%(today).  He also recorded to blocked shots and a relevant amount of rebounds. Certainly worthy of being on the floor during each game. I don't understand Doc River's desire for the Celtics organization to draft players they believe will help, pay them, and than allow them to collect cobb webs on their butts while riding pine.  Keep up the good work Celtics.
DNA and the I Ching::In fairness to Rivers, look at the guys he has gotten via the draft the last few years.   Pruitt,Giddens, Erden, Hudson, Harongody...these guys are either out of the League or riding the pine somewhere else.
DNA and the I Ching::Gotta love it when idiots think they have the slightest clue.
DNA and the I Ching::nba is the worst Will the Gahden be half-empty with the fans out of town for the super bowl?    Doesn't matter - the Geeztics will be taking the 4th off as usual.    Grizzlies + the points is the right play, as they will probably win outright. 6 Hours Ago · Like · Reply · Flag
kembawalkerismyhero::sold out crowd and the celtics won easily.  nice try though.
DNA and the I Ching::I hope Bass is out for a couple of more games so Johnson can get some more time.
trillville40::bass has been a solid contribution on both sides of the court....solid player but JJ does need minutes
DNA and the I Ching::Oh i agree, i wasnt complaining about Bass i just want Johnson to get some more experience. As well as Boston is playing they can get by without Bass for a few games.
WelfareNation::Avery Bradley turned this team around. Would love to see him and Rondo in the backcourt. Especially when Ray is cold.
robmoro78::bradley's defense is very good.  it's just a shame is is horrible at everything else.  rather see moore get his minutes.
trillville40::celtics should be running fast breaks to bradley all day
NBA_refs_are_weak::defensively it would be sick, but on O we'd have absolutely zero floor spacing
