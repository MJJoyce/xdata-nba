jrtall3n7::I'm glad the Nets decided to stop wasting Kris Humphries. I don't know what they've been thinking.
deymayor::Check the Nets and Knicks remaining schedule and if they win the games they should win, both will finish with 50 wins and the Nets will take the division by having a better Conf record.
nahimj92::If hadadi made that lay up..... It be going into over time... And Goran would have got me 3 more points so I win my fantasy basketball semi finals... Thanks hadadi didn't no u miss targets
arizonasting13::31-12-9, what a great night for him... too bad no one else around him has any talent.
arizonasting13::HOLY GORAN DRAGIC!
MafiosoSpaghetti::lousy nj $@%!$@%! couldn t cover the spread? you will go nowhere in he po's brainless morons
Porkchop8920::You call the Nets brainless morons yet you were betting??? Lol ok...
KMartKidd56::Don't be angry that you're the donkey vegas makes all their money off of.
ciorizzo::They play in Brooklyn you dummy.
achmed 41::I LOVE Goran Dragic
bricenovak333@gmail.com::let it be known the uranium iranian missed horribly
Ontario925::NCAA Tournament is much more exciting. You usually see two different teams in the National Championship game every year. The NBA 1999 to 2010 you used to get the Lakers and Spurs repeat nonsense in the Final almost every year. Now you have the Heat repeat crap in the Final every year. This is David Stern's repeat Champion lack of parity crap pro team sport.  The NBA was much better when there were no three peat crap every decade. That was before 1991.
IversonDaGreatest3::Then why da f*** you like the Knicks then bruh,if you dont like it dont watch it simple s***,then the NBA gets their players from the NCAA so dont blame the NBA because  some of talent in this generation sucks,proof this year another weak draft class...
barkleymax365::LETS SEE  FELTON MISSED 12 GAMES   MELO MISSED 13 GAMES  AMARE MISSED 38 GAMES  SHEED MISSED 48 GAMES  SHUMP MISSED 37 GAMES  KIDD MISSED 5 GAMES  CHANDLER  MISSED 6 GAMES  CAMBY HAS MISSED 25 + GAMES  AND YET WERE 42-26 with all those games missed 2 injury shuffling guys in and out of the lineup.  so please with the bs about injuries not being an excuse cause when its like that it most definitely is a good a$$ reason. Its something called chemistry
KMartKidd56::The Knicks assembled the oldest team in NBA history and you're acting as if you're surprised at the amount of injuries. Hilarious.
BigPhilly517::Can't count Sheed and Camby. It was expected that they would miss games. But yeah, Melo, Chandler, Felton, Shumpert are all legit.
Porkchop8920::Shumpert isn't legit. They signed Brewer knowin that Shump would be out for a while
Senator Cosgrove::Dragic almost with a triple doubl, thats all what counts at the end of the day, isnt that right Suns fans..Who cares about winning....Its about individual stats.....Great culture Hunter has out in here.  LOL, Suns grab 25 o boards but give up 15...This shows they can rebound, but are only committed to it on the o board, so they can pad stats
orange-bruins-suns-jaguars-mariners::dude shut up.  our season is in the toilet.  i could care less if we win from here on out.  i'd rather lose to get a better draft spot hopefully.  but yeah, we celebrate dragic having close to a triple double because that's really all we have to celebrate.  get lost.
ReeaaadThisSlow::My Isles won, Nets won....it's a RARE good sports night for me.  heh
thekola::anyway, i'm done arguing with the delusional children on here that like knicks. good game nets fan.
ReeaaadThisSlow::Well ugly game....good outcome!
BigPhilly517::Indiana is definitely the most overrated team by the media and fans.
ReeaaadThisSlow::You're BUGGIN.  No offense, Nets aren't the best there is, but that title likely goes to the Knicks.
BigPhilly517::They aren't a GREAT team. I never said they we. But newsflash: The only GREAT team in the East is Miami.
ReeaaadThisSlow::RIGHT!  See, now you're using numbers (facts).  But all that really means is that the Knicks are riding a GREAT november.  It doesn't make them a GREAT team, it makes them a good team that had a GREAT month, and that's why they are where they are.  They aren't there because they're a great team.  Don't you see the difference?
BigPhilly517::We're still second in the East, which means no one was able to take advantage of out stretches of terrible play/ injuries to key players. The Nets are still 3 out in the loss column.
ReeaaadThisSlow::BigPhilly517 - Joking, right? The Knicks get blasted out west w/out their 3 best players and the media acts like the sky is falling. Yet here we are with Melo healthy again sitting at second in the East.     Based on media/fan perception, you would NEVER know the Knicks are second in the East. FACT.  ------------ Let's look at the numbers.  The Knicks were 13 games over .500 around December.  Right now, they are 16.  That means they are on 3 games over .500 since that stretch.  That's not the same team.  If they continued the play from November, they would already be well over 50 wins.  Those are the numbers, how can you argue that?
BigPhilly517::Indiana loses at home to the Lakers without Kobe and to Philly and to Chicago without Noah and nobody says a word.
BigPhilly517::Joking, right? The Knicks get blasted out west w/out their 3 best players and the media acts like the sky is falling. Yet here we are with Melo healthy again sitting at second in the East.     Based on media/fan perception, you would NEVER know the Knicks are second in the East. FACT.
barkleymax365::CLE IS WITHOUT KYRIE AND WAITERS SO THEY SUCK RIGHT NOW
BigPhilly517::They suck with them
liquidvizions707::lol
barkleymax365::reaad the show  whats our record against mia this season? and what happened the 1st game against the thunder minus melo?  so its not far fetched idiot!
ReeaaadThisSlow::Stop hanging your hat on that.  You sound like an middle aged guy in late 40s, bald and fat, who talks about a hot girl he slept with once when he was 20.
liquidvizions707::lmao!
barkleymax365::We dont need tyson without gasol!!!!  Were not beating indy? Why? indy sucks on the road!
barkleymax365::WE WILL WIN 2 PLAYOFF SERIES THIS SEASON. wHO CARES ABOUT THE PAST.
BigPhilly517::I said we're gonna beat Indy at home
knicks_11::im out   #knickstape  look up to us
KMartKidd56::How angry does it make you that the Nets are relevant now?
djny2k12::1 playoff game victory since 2000....right!!!
Mets2410::last playoff series they won was part of a season that started last millenium
barkleymax365::GASOL IS OUT WITH AN ABDOMINAL INJURY
BigPhilly517::I didn't even know that... iight we gonna have to win that game if Tyson is healthy by then
barkleymax365::BIG PHILLY  WE AINT LOSING TO MEMPHIS MINUS GASOL SORRY! DONT SEE US LOSING TO CHICAGO EITHER ILL GIVE U AT MIA AT OKC AT ATL AS POSSIBLE LOSSES MAYBE BOSTON BUT CELTS SUCK A$$ RIGHT NOW AND IF KG AINT READY FORGET IT
ReeaaadThisSlow::You say MIA and OKC are "possible losses"??? This is why people laugh at Knicks fans.  Completely delusional
ReeaaadThisSlow::thekola - it seriously feels like I'm talking to children when I talk to Knick fans.  ----------  It's cause you are
thekola::it seriously feels like I'm talking to children when I talk to Knick fans.
BigPhilly517::Wait what happened to Gasol? Either way we still don't have Tyson at the moment
BigPhilly517::Knicks will finish 50-32      Wins      Charlotte Boston Milwaukee Washington @Cleveland Indy @Charlotte Atlanta      Losses      @Boston Memphis @Miami @Atlanta @OKC @Chicago     Then we just need the Nets to lose 4 out of @Portland, @Denver, @Utah on a b2b, vs Chicago on a b2b, @Boston on a b2b, and @Indiana.     Knicks will win the division.
thekola::so somehow playing Utah in a b2b makes the nets susceptible to a loss but the ancient artifacts on the knicks are unaffected by having to go to Cleveland on a b2b?? Horrible logic
BigPhilly517::It's no secret that they can't win on the road. You are aware that you were a missed wide open layup from a 7 footer from going into OT againat Phoenix, right?
thekola::BigPhilly517 - They're 24-9 at home  more relevant to the present, they've won 2 of their last 10 games. they have mailed in the season. think what you want though. who even cares?
BigPhilly517::They're 24-9 at home
thekola::and Utah is good?
BigPhilly517::They're 9-6 on b2b this year. Nice try pal. And Cleveland sucks.
ReeaaadThisSlow::They're not beating Indy. Sorry pal.
BigPhilly517::Lol
barkleymax365::its the way the have won the last 4 games WITH great defense that shows were turning the corner.  They kicked the raptors A$$  magics a$$ won at utah without anyone and won at tor. This week we will handle our business.  Hows our schedule that tough?  Grizz are without Marc gasol. celts look like trash and have injury issues. Pacers is at the garden.  hAWKS we will split with at worst. Maybe lose  both to thunder and heat maybe not
ReeaaadThisSlow::Dude, you're still naming wins against HORRIBLE teams, D or no D.  Anyway you slice it those are god awful teams.
ReeaaadThisSlow::I find Harden's beard disturbing
barkleymax365::Yeah we have dealt with a ton of injuries this season and are still 42-26 and look like were turning the corner. Nets havent dealt with many injuries at all. Lets see how nets would do without brook deron and joe for extending periods of time like we have missing felton amare melo and now chandler with wallace camby and others missing time as well. Knicks win the division nets finish 4th
djny2k12::Knicks are an aging squad....don't act so surprised when their key players have been out due to injury and stop using it as an excuse. Every team has had their share of injuries. If you have a team with a bunch of aging players....it doesn't take a genius to realize that they will be more injury prone.
whatsanoa::No injuries for the nets? Do your research before you speak you ignorant knicks fan.
Mets2410::what do you expect when you have 5 of the 6 oldest players in the league and 2 key players with an extensive injury history in Chandler and Amare? And the Nets have gone extended periods of time without Brook and some time without Joe too
thekola::exactly. put a bunch of relics on your roster and you should expect a lot of injuries
thekola::turning what corner? knicks beat the raptors without Rudy Gay. Big deal. How is that turning a corner?
Cashmoney9320::31  9  12  for Dragic????????  Dear god.  Deron Williams is so fat.
ReeaaadThisSlow::He had a double double on the backend of a double header on the road.  Nothing to sneeze at....
ReeaaadThisSlow::Cashmoney9320 - Cant let Dragic do that to you   I mean thats a great stat line for Lebron.  --------- If something is good enough for LeBron, it's good enough for any basketball player in the world
Cashmoney9320::Cant let Dragic do that to you   I mean thats a great stat line for Lebron.
thekola::Dragic didn't have to play a game last night.
Cashmoney9320::got torched by him tooo
Mets2410::let alone against the best pg in the league
knicks_11::lin killed him in his first breakout game
RNYC_125::D Will doesn't play defense.
Cashmoney9320::lol  D Will must play absolutely no defense.  What a fat pile of sh|||||t
Ontario925::No thanks to idiot ownership management of bad teams for years from the Raptors and Cavaliers, the Heat get gift wrapped top all star NBA team players of theirs put together in South Beach.
Ontario925::You are crying? Remove the uppercase letters do-che,lol
Ontario925::Uppercase letters,lol.Real tough poser. Little guy syndrome I see,hahahaha
His name is Cornelius and he invented Long Division::YOU CRYING BECAUSE YOUR JEALOUS OF OTHER TEAMS TYPICAL KNICKS FAN  LMAO
Ontario925::July 2010 established Lebron James jock bandwagon following to South Beach. Never heard of real Heat fans. No such thing. Phony jock bandwagon Lebron jock fans are everything bad about fans. A cancer to real fans and sports. You give real lifelong loyal team fans a bad name. Get the hell out of here you bandwagon phony Lebron jock punk fans.
His name is Cornelius and he invented Long Division::HAVE AN ISSUE GET A TISSUE YOU WUSSY, TELL YOURE SAD STORIES TO THE HIGH PRIEST, NOBODY GIVESA CRAP IN HERE ABOUT YOOUR OPIIONS!
His name is Cornelius and he invented Long Division::SHUT UP
barkleymax365::we as knicks fans really fear the nets catching us.  (LMFAO)   Knicks win 51 they win the division and we will. Knicks will go 3-1 minimum this week if not 4-0. Celts are in sad shape. Nets will lose to den port and possibly utah and division goes bye bye
djny2k12::Knicks schedule gets really ugly from here on out...no more playing raptors....hawks twice, celtics twice, heat, thunder, grizzlies, pacers and bulls
ReeaaadThisSlow::I call a 3-6 during that stretch
thekola::again, why would the nets be able to beat the Mavs but not beat Portland?? Denver is tough but Utah has pretty much mailed in the season.
liquidvizions707::yeh i dont even know how utah is where they at. everytime it seems i check the score they getting blown the f out
ReeaaadThisSlow::The Knicks had a 9 game lead on the Nets.  It's two.  They've pretty much caught you.  It's not hard to imagine the Nets winning two in a row and the Knicks losing 2 in a row.  That's not a crazy scenario.
ReeaaadThisSlow::Last night and tonight.....Nets lead in second half, about 200 comments, the other teams (Clips and Suns) come back, and the trolls come out of the walls like roaches when the lights are out....
thekola::If the Nets can beat the Mavs, they can beat Portland. Those teams are about equal
ReeaaadThisSlow::Def.  And Portland plays AWFUL D.  The Nets just have to keep up their end of the bargain on the defensive side and the should be ok.  Portland isn't playing for much these days (doubt they have a chance to get in), and I don't think they'll necessarily "get up" for the game against BK, not like they're playing the Lakers or a west team
BigPhilly517::Portland is 22-11 at home
thekola::dallas is about 2 games worse than them at home. they are the same team basically
knicks_11::^lol
hdmgt01::Suns absolutely stink, ownership has done a terrible job puting a competitive team on the floor, firing a good coach and turning the fans against the franchise....owners have got to go, not going to another game as long as the three stooges are running the show....pathetic
mikeyjm1412::Boy anime has gone downhill lately...
ReeaaadThisSlow::If you say so
Ontario925::The Craptors should just fold their crap team and move close by to Buffalo NY. The State of NY could always use a 3rd NBA. Afterall the Buffalo Braves used to play in the NBA until 1978.
Ontario925::Bring back the Expos and bring an NBA team to Montreal too.
liquidvizions707::calgary?
liquidvizions707::that wouldn't be fair to canada. they already lost vancouver. wouldnt be right with no canada team. move them if you want but move them in canada
liquidvizions707::no. dont wanna hear the game in french. :P
Ontario925::To Montreal?
djny2k12::Btw, how do you pass the ball to Gerald Wallace knowing the Suns will foul you....Deron should have just held on to the ball. These are the only Nets players I trust would come through in the clutch shooting FT's:  Deron Williams CJ Watson Brook Lopez
Mets2410::I would trust JJ too, but he wasn't playing tonight
thekola::um, they trapped him. he holds onto that ball and we might be complaining about another turnover
knicks_11::we gave a better  competition to the nuggets  than nets ever will  and we lost by 23
ReeaaadThisSlow::What?  Do you come with a translator?
Mets2410::a better what? bj? over the pants hj?
Mets2410::sorry I didn't know this was the knicks gamethread
IversonDaGreatest3::Great to see D.Williams doing well again,dude seem like a good person
Ontario925::Whose streak will end first: The Heat or Nuggets?
ReeaaadThisSlow::Nuggets for sure cause the Nets play them in a few days
pico2013::heat
knicks_11::ya madres!
djny2k12::Nets 3-1 on this road trip so far....a win is a win especially on the road. It's the same as if they lost by 1 point...still counts as a loss.  Nets schedule eases up considerably after Nuggets and Knicks have a killer schedule coming up.
djny2k12::Knicks do not fare well against physical teams....they are no longer playing a cupcake schedule.
djny2k12::Indiana has owned the Knicks....Memphis is a physical team...those are two losses.
BigPhilly517::Nah.. You just said Indiana has owned the Knicks. They're 2-1 against us with the home team winning every game. One of the games was in Indy w/out Felton and Melo. The only game that was at MSG the Knicks blew them out. They haven't owned anything.
djny2k12::I am going by facts....not "I stick by what I said and gut feelings"....Knicks don't fare well against physical teams. They live and die by the 3 point shooting....and Knicks are an aging squad....I wonder why Knick fans are always surprised when their players go down. Knicks beat Indy during the beginning of the season when they got off to a hot start...heck they beat Miami as well. All of those teams are playing a lot better than they were earlier in the season.
BigPhilly517::We blew Indy at home the only time we played them at MSG... One of the times they beat us was w/out Felton and Melo... Keep letting the BS ESPN narratives brainwash you.
djny2k12::Knicks have 2 games against Atlanta, 2 games against Boston, Miami, Oklahoma City, Chicago, Indiana and Memphis
ReeaaadThisSlow::Gasol is out for the Grizzlies, the KNicks lucked out
BigPhilly517::They'll split with ATL and BOS, beat Indy at home, lose to OKC and CHI. Memphis is a toss up.
liquidvizions707::ouch. that's rough as well
djny2k12::Nets are 2-0 against Pacers, 2-1 against Celtics and 1-2 against Bulls....
ReeaaadThisSlow::BigPhilly517 - I stick by what I said  ---------  Ok, but the numbers don't favor what you said, they favor the opposite.
BigPhilly517::I stick by what I said
BigPhilly517::Ya'll will lose @Portland, @Denver, @Utah on a b2b, vs Chicago on a b2b. @Boston on a b2b, and @Indiana
BigPhilly517::I thought they would beat Detroit, Phoenix, Cleveland no question, lose to Denver, LAC, Portland and Utah... And Dallas was a toss up.
thekola::why exactly will they lose to Portland? Dallas is about as good as Portland.
ReeaaadThisSlow::BigPhilly517 - I've been saying from the beginning 3-5 or 4-4... And I stand by that  --------- Alright, you're def the exception, most Knicks fans did not see 3 wins on this trip for the Nets.  I say 5-3, but of course I'm bias.  But they CAN do 5-3 on this
BigPhilly517::I've been saying from the beginning 3-5 or 4-4... And I stand by that
ReeaaadThisSlow::Yea, just like all Knicks fans were saying we wouldn't win 2 games on this trip.  It's half over we have 3 already (and almost stole a 4th last night)
liquidvizions707::wow. them are some tough games. nets gonna have to ball their lives off
ReeaaadThisSlow::Calling it now.  Nets drop kick the Nuggets in a few days.
ReeaaadThisSlow::Alright, don't see it happening, but you never know.  They can't (and won't) win them all.  They CAN lose.
thekola::Denver runs teams out of their gym at the high altitude.
BigPhilly517::Lmao
Boyanime::K
pico2013::Dream on
Ontario925::Ugly win. A win but not good with the postseason just weeks away.
BigPhilly517::Haddadi didn't even hit the rim on that last shot... Good God
liquidvizions707::thats how that brickhead rolls
Mets2410::D-Will and CJ putting the team on their back down the stretch for a Nets win!
liquidvizions707::well thank the suns for playing their typical dumb basketball as well.
Mets2410::goes both ways. you can thank the nets for letting the suns back in the game. tough game, but the better team won.
liquidvizions707::like Morris. fouling after the suns intentions were to play the clock. that brickhead fouls 12 seconds later.
pico2013::they tanked to win the lottery pick
Ontario925::The ESPN scoreboard is changing more screwy than my 44 year old fiance with the hot flashes
BigPhilly517::Ya'll are lucky Haddadi is allergic to finishing at the cup
pico2013::because he's not a go to guy he is a role player.
liquidvizions707::yeh that guy is a trainwreck
liquidvizions707::in the end u can never count on the guy though
pico2013::he had 6 rebounds and 4 blocks.
BigPhilly517::lmao
joelkeith24::what the fuckkkkkk
ReeaaadThisSlow::Alright guys, we know, Nets almost blew it.  Tough loss last night, doubt they rested that well for this game, they pulled it off, whatever.  They do need to hold on to these leads though, it's becoming a joke, and everyone is laughing but Nets fans
pico2013::Lakers fans
Rezo201::When you're on an 8 game road trip, some of the wins are going to be ugly. 8 game road trips can kill a team.
lagrua08::who hit the shot
ReeaaadThisSlow::which shot?
cha cha cha chia.-::Nice to see D-Will back to his old self again. Been tearin it up latley
Boyanime::He's still tearing it up Double Double is nice
Justin16161::nets win 102-100
Pirates Maul Brewers::the Nets found a way to hold on here, that's the key, now two days off and they head to Portland
BigPhilly517::Play like this in Rip City and ya'll will be embarrassed
Pirates Maul Brewers::each game has its own way of unfolding, and the nets wont play like that next game
