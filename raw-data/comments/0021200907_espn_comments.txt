luvnbayes::I'll say it again, if Rubio can become a decent shooter, not great, just decent, he will dominate this league.
MinniWolves90::Luke is so under-appreciated by Wolves Nation. His defense is terrible, but at least he can usually hit open jumpers, that's more than you can say about anybody else on the team.
VikingsRavensMN::i just say that because usually JJ is with him which makes him worse. The Barea Effect
MinniWolves90::Lol, I can agree with that.  Rubio/Ridnour back-court is usually very effective. Rubio always finds Ridnour for and open shot, and Ridnour's FG% while playing alongside Ricky shows that.
SEC University is my favorite team::Can I just point out how epic of a name Cartier Martin is?  Top 5 NBA names for sure
SoCalGirl129::lol
eliasfcb10::If Rubio improve his shot skills he will be one of the best PG in the NBA, en can do everything
Kobe 6-24 Game 7 Finals::Rubio sucks
crooked ernie::wow! Rubio!!! his shot percentage is s h i.t but if he can score 16, 11 assists, 7 boards and 6 steals more often it would be a game changer.  He did alot this game to help the team win.
MinniWolves90::4 steals in the final 8 minutes. Wolves were down 8 when he checked back in. He just WANTS it more than anyone else. It's a shame he's not surrounded by good players.

I want to eat Norris Cole hair::We need to go into tank mode winning is useless at this point! We need that oladipo guy from Indiana!
vikings282654::I agree, would LOVE Oladipo on the Wolves
thewolf1616::Way to make ricky play with a group of scrubs lol
mnsportswopwopwahhh::So proud of our little unicorn tonight!
dnyberg225::As a Wolves fan, I would no doubt rather have Ricky long term than Kevin love.  Love Ricky's competitiveness and ability to make others better.  Love is still sick though, just need him back healthy. Can't wait till next year, hopefully we resign pek and everyone is healthy.  Rubio-AK-Love-Pek is a pretty legit foursome. Factor in an improving D-will, more experienced shved, Luke, Barea, healthy Budjnger for some 3's maybe a free agent and a lotto pick - plus we have the grizzlies 1st rd pick so maybe we make a move for a sg or trade up in the draft.    The West is so tought that we still might be a lower seed but dam n I'm excited. Just really hope we stay healthy.
dnyberg225::As much as it pains me to say; give Kahn 1 more year to see what a healthy team does.  Otherwise it's time to change it up, Kahn is definitely an eccentric gm, but I like the players we have.    Hopefully the U fires tubby and can hire Flip?  Wouldn't mind flip as the gm but not sure if I'd want him in that position.    Go Wolves!
dnyberg225::Same old song and dance? Seriously, LOL we have been absolutely decimated by injuries.  I agree AK has been slowing down a bit, not sure if its injuries/workload or just him getting old and being an effort/aggressive player his whole career.  Seriously though u cannot expect another injury plagued year as much as this one.  You've got to be kidding me with that comment melosh1977.  it's nice to have an above average coach like Adelman at the helm as well.  Hopefully Rubio doesn't get alienated by the losing.
Minnysota Vikings::I think we're gonna need to replace AK soon. His play has really diminished as the season has progressed. I don't know if it's nagging injuries or what, but his defense has even been lackluster.
Melosh1977::Next year will be no different. This was suppose to be a break out year. Next year it will be the same song, just a different verse.
wunderrr::Suns have a new definition of tank mode wow
vikings282654::For the life of me I cant recall why we didn't keep them...
Minnysota Vikings::It's not tanking. It's called Wes Johnson and Michael Beasley.
thewolf1616::wolves have a new one also! ...luke gele and steamer
Scott50559::Been betting with a system for sports bets named Sportsbettingstar. I have made over $3,000 a month for three consecutive months now since I found out about this system. You can find it on the first page of Google by searching for Sports Betting Systems. At first I thought this was going to be bogus but ended up being awesome..
FlimFlamDuck::John Wall is still a top 10 pg in the league. People here need to realize how good he is. Look at the Wiz's record with him compared to when he was hurt this year
rdelperdang::14-12!  Dude, the team is 19-40??? you're killing me.
FlimFlamDuck::look it up. he is 14-12 while playing. price was 5-28. The 19-40 is in no way his fault
rdelperdang::not all about stats - just watch him - perpetually out of control.  aj price is wizard future pg.
FlimFlamDuck::AJ Price was 5-28
FlimFlamDuck::hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahah AJ PRICE IS TERRIBLE!!!!! Also, the wiz are 14-12 with him playing. I like that stat more than assist/to
rdelperdang::same word that wall is a great pg.
rdelperdang::by the way, Creighton is staying in their conference.  Unlike the the Gtown.
GeorgetownDC39::Are they word has it they are going to the C7. Oh well, sucks for them they cant even beat Drake and Indiana State LOLOLOL
rdelperdang::Losing to Villanova???   Make you feel good about post-season?
rdelperdang::yeah, probably the key pg stat.
rdelperdang::it doesn't matter - you love wall.  he's going to impregnate your prom date.  and you're going to be really depressed.
FlimFlamDuck::my prom was 2 years ago. I'm not in love with wall i just think people ware being way too hard on him. Look at career stats/teams that he has been on. Just look at the usage% if you are such a stats centered guy. 27.6% that is unbelievably high. he is forced to go iso a lot due to the inability of his teammates
rdelperdang::oh really??  look at Assist/TO.
GeorgetownDC39::Haha Just a spoken like a stat junkie. He is having a bad year coming off INJURY. Compare his career stats to others you named. and Keep in mind the teams he is forced to play on. Also Creighton will get their a$$ whooped next year in a real conference
FlimFlamDuck::cant just look at 1 stat. Wall is better in most categories compared to all of those guys
GeorgetownDC39::Felton, Lowery, Dragic, Conley, Lin, Hill, Nelson. At least the list above is halfway realistic this list has no credibility.
rdelperdang::georgetown guy - you are smoking crack, but i admire your optimism.
rdelperdang::thank you - i hadnt even finished - irving, westbrook
rdelperdang::better pgs - paul, calderon, parker, vasquez, hill, rondo, jameer nelson, lowry, dragic, lawson, felton, dwill, conley, curry, lin, holiday, lillard.
FlimFlamDuck::Did you really say that Lin, nelson, vasquez, calderon, lowry, dragic, felton, hill are better than wall that is embarrassing for you. Lillard has been pretty bad for the second half of the year, id take wall over him. Give wall a year and he will be better than conley.
rdelperdang::you're losing it.  you're looking at the wrong stuff, dude.
FlimFlamDuck::curry basically plays sg in his offense (jack is the real pg). Lillard has been bad the second half of the year and even first half lillard is worse than wall, blazers only got such a high pick because aldridge got hurt, team is just as good without him. Williams has been god awful this year. Call wall a bad shooter but fail to realize how terrible williams has been shooting
Minnysota Vikings::FlimFlamDuck - who are 10 better pg's  1.) Chris Paul 2.) Derrick Rose 3.) Tony Parker 4.) Kyrie Irving 5.) Rajon Rondo 6.) Russell Westbrook 7.) Stephen Curry 8.) Jrue Holliday 9.) Damian Lillard 10.) Deron Williams
GeorgetownDC39::The skill set man. Talent wise he is a prodigy top 5 PG easily. He makes really stupid mistakes though and cant manage games well enough yet. He needs the right coach and proper off season along with the right pieces to prosper. He is the type of talent you build around. Also he is outta shape this season cause of the injury
FlimFlamDuck::who are 10 better pg's
GeorgetownDC39::I agree. You would think people would realize he plays with scrubs and has to do EVERYTHING himself on offense
FlimFlamDuck::him and beal are this entire teams offense. and with him out it is just him out there. If he develops a jumper he is a top 5 pg
Wayz112::Here is what our lineup should be next year (After trading Wall for Kanter and lotto pick): pg Trey Burke sg Beal  sf Porter Pf Nene C Kanter
GeorgetownDC39::Utah would Never make that trade. They would only give up Jefferson for him. No lottery and no Kanter
Wayz112::haha
GeorgetownDC39::Oh well in that case we could easily have Favors, Kanter Lottery pick for next 3 years Jefferson and cash considerations
Wayz112::Ok fine. I didn't wanna have to do this. I'll throw in Jan to sweeten the deal
FlimFlamDuck::Gelebale is the truth. I should no my sonics drafted him!!!! best first rounder ever!!! Right up there with Johan Petro, Muhammad Sene Saer, and Robert Swift!!!!!!!!
GeorgetownDC39::Alright fellow Wiz fans here is what the starting line up for next year has to be PG Wall SG Beal SF Porter Jr. PF Josh Smith   - We have the cap space to give him a max C Okafor  Trade Nene for a solid bench scorer or maybe Pau Gasol
rdelperdang::he's a good fit mentally?? not a good comment cuz this team's mental makeup is, well ... one flew over the cuckoo's nest.
GeorgetownDC39::I was joking around... Beal and Porter are mental warriors and would shape J Smoove and Wall around to winning Basketball. Maybe get Larry Brown or Gary Williams to come in and coach some sense into them
FlimFlamDuck::i was about to say this exact thing
Minnysota Vikings::Josh Smith is the perfect player for the Wiz. Talented but plays stupid alot of times.
GeorgetownDC39::He is a great fit both physically and mentally
Phillip25A::good job Derrick Williams!
rdelperdang::gawd - john wall is awful.  he reminds me of the kid when you were little who was the only one who could dribble real well, but thought that's all the game is about.  and now he's a "pro" and his IQ is stuck at age 12.
FlimFlamDuck::Name 10 better
rdelperdang::here's a question for you.  what is washington's performance against pointspread with wall at pg ... a metric that should at least measure performance against expectations - it sucks.
FlimFlamDuck::win loss with him vs him out with injury is a better stat
rdelperdang::you're nuts.  by what measure???
FlimFlamDuck::still a top 10 pg
rdelperdang::he's a turnover machine
FlimFlamDuck::19 7 3 3 1 is such a bad stat line...
ih8pikeys::WTF Rubio... Under 30%? lol
Minnysota Vikings::Jim Peterson is such a fantastic analyst. Hopefully the Wolves never let him go. The play by play guy sucks though.
mnsportswopwopwahhh::a Jim Petersen/Trent Tucker is my dream analysts combo
Phillip25A::Congrats DWill
YogaBeer::Has anyone yelled,   "DAGGER"  yet?
MarylandFan4.20::Minnesota can just draft McLemore. Easy solution for us all.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::wizards don't diserve a good draft pick. I mean are you guys really ever going anyway ever? lol?
Dances With Timberwolves::GG Wizards fans
GeorgetownDC39::GG the Better team lost
A Wild Wizard Fan Appeared::Wizards plan:  1. Fire Grunfeld 2. Teach Wall to: Keep his dribble as he drives, how to shoot 3. Draft Otto Porter 4. Build around Beal
DX_Hoo::How does Ernie still have a job? I swear he uses a dartboard for decision-making.
GeorgetownDC39::YES YES Hell YES YES
MarylandFan4.20::But no, we have to build around Wall. Proven when he came back from his injury.
patsmayo1::point 2... is priority number 1 or cut your losses and move along , try and trade him
MarylandFan4.20::I like your name. LOL. But no, Wall is the player to build around. He's proven that when he came back from his injury.
Dances With Timberwolves::me too
MarylandFan4.20::Son of a sh'it stain.   Otto Porter coming to D.C guys!
GeorgetownDC39::We need him and only him
BaltimOre1576::we can only hope.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::baltimore u able to watch the lakers in ur cave bro?
BaltimOre1576::wtf I don't like the LAKERS! I hate them.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::did lakers win or lose u love them so much
Minnysota Vikings::I'm glad we won. Felt bad for Rubio constantly giving his all and never winning.
Dances With Timberwolves::Yeah but now the wiz are 2.5 games ahead instead of .5.
Minnysota Vikings::Thankfully it's a draft lottery. Don't need to have the worse record to get the better pick.
GeorgetownDC39::haha wolves got owned
Dances With Timberwolves::Wanna trade scores?
GeorgetownDC39::Nice try cant out tank the wiz
i-just-ate-a-whole-bag-of-chips::o ye Whiz fans take cheer, for now thy chance is near, a game so full of mockery,  all for a chance at the lottery
Wayz112::Wizards are the best!!!! Great tank loss!!!!
Dances With Timberwolves::It didn't count as a shot.
jeter7322::haha wizards suck, but even with the loss they win.
Sir Mittens the ninth::yes a win:)
BaltimOre1576::good job =) our quest for the best odds
nietoadrian::I LOVE RUBIO
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::rubio best player in nba
GarnettMoss::John Wall sucks
patsmayo1::open your eyes, he's awful
patsmayo1::yes
BaltimOre1576::really?
Wayz112::Good tank loss for the Wizards!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BaltimOre1576::GAME YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
spennyjj3::RICKKKYYYY
vegasbuster10::Wizards are a complete joke.....wall and nene both are bums
patsmayo1::you're dreaming Maryland fan, he's not smart enough, watch Kyrie irving, he has vision, passing ability, shooting ability, handles etc... and he doesnt get rattled and choke it up every other possession, Irving not wall is the future
MarylandFan4.20::I'll agree with Nene but Wall is going to show the world that he's a guaranteed Top PG in the league in his prime.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::RUBIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Dances With Timberwolves::Rubio 4-16 now.....
Minnysota Vikings::lol did they count that as a FG attempt?
Dances With Timberwolves::IDK that was the joke though.
i-just-ate-a-whole-bag-of-chips::two whiz fans, one cup
Dances With Timberwolves::PG Rubio SG Me SF Porter PF Love C Pek
MarylandFan4.20::Hell no, Porter is coming to our team. He belongs to D.C anyways.
redwiznatcapfan::Nah, we do.
Dances With Timberwolves::No we need him more.
Minnysota Vikings::Chris Johnson won this game for us :)
the_tyler_hans::Go Wizards! The Wolves need a higher pick than you guys!  GO WIZARDS GO WIZARDS GO WIZARDS!
MarylandFan4.20::As long as the Wiz gets Otto Porter, I'm happy.
BaltimOre1576::NOOOO!!
GarnettMoss::R. Rubio 15 Pts, 7 Reb, 11 Ast, 6 Stl  where are all the haters now??????
GarnettMoss::and this is not a one gamer, he has been this for over a month now....   he is healed
Dances With Timberwolves::4-15 is pretty bad though  Pretty sure no one is hating on Rubio
