sambucaron::Ive been following the Knicks since Bill Bradley came back from England to play ( can anyone name the 5 players whose last name started with 'B' that were on the team ?) and the one glaring constant thru all these years is this: nobodoy, and I mean NOBODY, on the Knicks follows their shot. Watch when a shot goes up, 99 times out of 100, they're all backpedaling from the 3 point line. Best player that remedied that was David Lee and they let him go, for what?
Gotham::Wrong move for Coach Woodson to start Chandler right away after the Knicks were rolling with K-Mart starting. Hope Im wrong but it may not look good tomorrow in Indy. Pacer's Hibbert will definitely eat Chandler's lunch like last May. After last season with rashes of injuries & illnesses, Chandler is not what he was when he won defensive player of the year two years ago. Even scrub centers are getting the best of him.
Bob::Jefferson put Chandler in a corset and stilettos this game!
Jason::Anybody know why J.R. Isn't playing?
Drewching::Really not surprised NY lost, they have been pretty unpredictable, and the Cats beat them once earlier this season. AL Jefferson did great to secure the win.
Danielle::20 points on 22 attempts. Just another day at the brick office for Carmelo
Vartino C::With Indiana and the Clippers next, NY cannot look past this team. Cannot have low assist and high turnover game again as they did against Phoenix.  Go to Charlotte, jump on them early and get this win.
Lucio Anti-EVOBOding::Knicks , Nets are lakers are done this year, they must scrutinized well and reorganized their team next season! hahahaha
lbirdfan33::should have stayed at IU another year cody...sitting behind fellow hoosier and jouneyman josh mcroberts, averaging 5 ppg, shooting 35% from field, was it worth it? the money would be there next year. stay in college, get stronger/tougher, enjoy the college experience, develop some post moves and maybe win it all.
