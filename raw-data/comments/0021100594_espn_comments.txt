Calioyo::poop
Calioyo::guess what Blazer fans? even LA isnt very good...  a borderline All Star, and probably ur best trade chip.  No B Roy, No Oden, and prolly reached his ceiling.  Sad?  True.  Get rid of him before he gets hurt, but I doubt you could get very much.  An Ichiro in the NW he is not, meaning you wont get fans very much longer just because people go to watch LA
JimboNoyes::wont get fans?      we have plenty thank you.     you just want LA to be traded to your team. do not get me wrong under a differant coaching style he would be playing much better.
Calioyo::i live in DT Portland and go to over 20 home games a year.  I have seen the mural outside the Rose Garden go from "Rise With Us" to the today pathetic "PortLAnd" ......  something isnt working, and I think Portland is stuck in the past.
Kjames1986::Blazers had zero turnovers in the second half....and killed it from the free throw! YEA!
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::wow, LMA 80% tonight, great game
doggtoyork::hahahaa thunder turned down harden and ibaka for dwight REST OF THE LEAGUE ARE SOO LUCKY THEY DECLINED THEY COULD HAVE BEEN UNREAL http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::D12 wouldn't have singed on for long term. They made the smart choice nit to give up 2 core players for a guy that would just be here for half a season. Glad they turned it down, this team will dominate for years, if they did trade it would have been just for the rest of the seasons. Not worth it at all.
Kobelies247::people dont really care anymore...
Kobelies247::Dunno bout you other blazer fans but im buying my playoff tickets tomorrow.................................................
JimboNoyes::^ i bet you are a thunder fan that says "his" team has one champion ship
THUNDEROWNTHEWEST82HAHA::Just to watch them  get bounced out, wow being happy about that is foolish. Hey how did that Oden pick over KD work out for your Blazers, lmao thanks Blazers front office fir being idiots.
Chris 5 yards after contact Ivory::Wall makin 9% of his 3 pointers
doggtoyork::dallas sux
BlazerSully::Figures after I dog Fat Felton and Crawford, they come in and have decent games tonight.  Oh well, even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and then,  Wallace on the other hand showed his true road sissy mentality again tonight.
Kobelies247::Ive said it many times before and ill say it again,  Bad teams make other bad teams look good!
roymullins::Sub.500Portland beats the Wiz and...!  nobody cares...  what is worse than being bad?  being irrelevant...  that is what Sub.500Portland has become...  not that they were that relevant before...  just like their fans and their city...  nobody hardly knows you exist...  enjoy your sub.500/irrelevant evening...
BlazerSully::Says the poster whos the most irrelevant poster in Blazer history.
_tjc44_::Well, you comment on Blazer boards every day, so i'm pretty sure YOU know we exist.

Kobelies247::That tends to happen when you play bad teams  DUH
datmangud::Easy $$$ on da blazers
3arod13::Looks like old man Crawford outplayed youngster Crawford today.
suorangefan4::The under stood no chance in this one
spear_mccoy::So the Wiz play the Lakers tough but let Portland come in and win this one easily, makes no sense....
erock_ducks2007::thats why the wiz only have 9 wins. no consistency. they have talent tho.
mjbro14::No Batum down the stretch?
Atkifle::Alright chalking this up as a Blazers ml win. Wizards are done. See u later guys.

Brianhau529::actually a good link
Atkifle::Easiest lock of the day. Blazers ml! I told everyone I knew!

Atkifle::Told you Blazers ml was a lock. You have a team that can score and another team who cant defend. Easy.
rocketrayone::Come on! get that total over that magical 2 ton
Gina_Bradley24749::draft a new team every day in daily fantasy:   http://bit.ly/AsQKiX
ben_jam_in_5::Washington is so lucky to be in this game they cant even make free throws
ragcity2012::MAN, FAKERS ARE BETTER THAN US ON THE ROAD.  WTF
J-SMOOVE2031::Wizards need to build around Wall, Mcgee, Crawford.  Everyone else needs to go.
adajwiz::Booker is way better than McGee and he is only in his second year. Wall and T-Book are the only untouchables right now.
ragcity2012::I LIKE BOOKER MORE THAN THE STUPID McGEE
terrapin5dixon::"McGee will be the 2nd best center in the game in a few years."  Are you f'ng serious, bro? The basketball police are coming to put you away for a long, long time..
arhalley0::LOL. You must not watch him play much. He has at least 2 goal tends a game and refuses to learn how to defend the pick and roll.
ragcity2012::NOPE.  AnDRE JORDAN IS BETTER (THE DUDE CAN BLOCK A FEW SHOTS)...AND HE COUNDNT GET MORE THAN 25 MIN A GAME.
J-SMOOVE2031::McGee will be the 2nd best center in the game in a few years.
Atkifle::Blazers ml easy money. Lock of the day. Wizards are trash. They won their Championship game against the Lakers the other day. This game they return to their losing ways.
Atkifle::Wizards are terrible. It is a lock.
jkrieger96::Blazers suck period.
erock_ducks2007::so do the wizards. so....
thenarddog555::dont sure yaself. i have money on them as well but dont get cocky. blazers suck on the road and you know that.
Heavyweight on Bantam::The Blazers suck
Taylorwightman::babbit is a boss
mjbro14::KEEP BABBITT!
erock_ducks2007::absolutely not.
jkrieger96::agreed. Get rid of everyone, including the coach, except williams, pryz, aldridge, and batum
erock_ducks2007::so.. not everyone.. haha. bt yeah. i like williams. i like pryz. i like his style. and aldridge and batum are musts to have on the team.
thenarddog555::if port cant win this game than just hang it up. the wizards are pure garbage juice. if you cant beat the bottom feeders than just hang it up.
mjbro14::Felton
PortBlazerFan22::...likes cupcakes
mjbro14::;Portland should trade him for a Big Mac &amp; a Coke
LostAussie95::At least portland would get something out of that :P
ben_jam_in_5::....is fat and overweight
thenarddog555::sucks
ben_jam_in_5::It was unnecessary because it was a blatant push to the floor and excessive because it was after the play was over during the inbound good call
erock_ducks2007::cause if your'e gonna say it was unnecesary because it was after the play was over, and during the inbound then so was saraphin shoving camby, because it was after the play and during the inbound. good job guy. you're an idiot.
erock_ducks2007::you're really trying to justify the refs ejecting camby? you've gotta be kidding me. he is getting a forearm to the throat. shoves the guy and the guy just falls. gets up and shoves camby in the chest. that should be a tech for both and thats it. there was no need to eject anyone especially camby. he was even backing up after he pushed the guy and there wasn't gonna be any call until saraphin gets upand shoves camby back. you've gotta be kidding me that was a horrible call. you can like your team but come on man.
jeremylinnotarapsttalktokobe::anthony davis is on his way washington
erock_ducks2007::haha instant contender is a little much. theres 0 way they are an instant contender.
jkrieger96::wall is garbage
getz104::God I hope so. Imagine Davis and Wall instant contender...
thenarddog555::instant? lmaoooooo cani have what your smoking plzz

Novak Kapono::Aldridge or Love?  Why? http://bit.ly/xCkgGq
erock_ducks2007::as much as i love aldridge. love is a better player right now. his rebounding and passing is what makes the difference between himself and every other pf in the league right now.
58rhodes::Aldridge needs to stop being a panzy@$$ and take over the game
Atkifle::60% shooting lmfao!
58rhodes::Foster is a terd
anonymous_sports_watcher__::guess he didnt like seraphin pushing him in the throat
jkrieger96::It should not have been a flagrant 2. The rule for that states "Unnecessary and excessive." Yeah, it was unnecessary (but honestly if someone puts their elbow in my throat I'm gonna shove them over too), but it wasn't excessive. Seraphin is a $@%!$. I can't believe he only got a technically for the response
redscapswizfan::its basketball its a physical game... Its incidental contact.. Hes needs to grow up.
erock_ducks2007::are you kidding me? grow up? cause your guy coming back up shoving camby was him being mature? hahaha. you're right. great point!
redscapswizfan::its not like Camby is a good player so who cares.
erock_ducks2007::and how is camby not a good player? do you watch basketball? or just your terrible wizards.
erock_ducks2007::we have no team leaders. i like camby but  we have none right now.
jkrieger96::He's our best rebounder. And he's a team leader. Game is going to be different now that he's gone. At least Pryz is gonna get a lot of minutes
Brianhau529::$@%! that $@%!, that is so gay
Brianhau529::What a bunch of $@%!$@%!
4thstringcoach::portland, this is so sad. stand up for your pride.
