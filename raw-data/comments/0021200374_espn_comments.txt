NavyJoe::ESPN...get your heads out of your ****** and put the highlights up.  Grizzlies once again dissed by ESPN because they are not the "sexy team".
icepik1234::Its all good. Instead they have a video up that mentions every team but the Grizzlies. Its not like they were at the game filming.
CubicleJoe::farts.  bucks can't handle these guys.  grizz look pretty tough.
AKsparky907::Another strong defensive performance by the grizz. Lets make it 4 in a row on Friday!
wkdavis85::First 5,000 fans friday get free Grizz gift wrap...everyone should go to that game!
selmertigress::Proud of the Memphis faithful and their Grizz!
knight_rider_1983::Great crowd again tonight  Lets pack the Grind house Fridaynight Grizz nation  Le go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
panther4406::I don't understand Scott Skiles. So much potential being wasted on the bench. This team should be scoring 110/game.
d_bokk::who? i hope you aren't talking about Harris.
colobr731::Jennings and Monta should never be on the court at the same time. These 2 should not be allowed to be called NBA players, certainly not starters. Its like someone took JR Smith, made him undersized, gave him a worse shot, told him to chuck more and took away all defensive ability and awareness.  Shameful display from the Bucks, they desperately need to trade one of these 2 and draft + talent guards this year. The promising young front court is going to go to waste unless the 1 and 2 spots are vastly improved for next year.
Grindhouse2413::Great grit and grind game griz fans. 17-6!
squiddy45::Well...That was embarrassing. Exactly what i wanted them to avoid. This matchup is a complete mismatch favoring the grizzlies.

legendjr_27::Bucks need to suit up Scott Skiles.
legendjr_27::Was the term barnburner invented in Milwaukee?
WIstormchaser2119::no, Twister
WIstormchaser2119::Ok thats enough for tonight,

Brewcrewtilldeath20::If I had one wish it'd be bringing Greg Ostertag back to the league
BCowsill2451::Shawn Bradley &gt; Greg Ostertag
BCowsill2451::Fine  Lawerence Funderburke &gt; Greg Ostertag
Brewcrewtilldeath20::Absolutely not
theells1::With a normal monta night (5-14 instead of 1-14) the bucks would have been in the thick of things. Not to bad of a loss. The grizzlies played some really good d. Brandon and monta aren't that good but don't let this game be the judge of the 2. Maybe the national tv got to them or they were tired. They played last night too.
BCowsill2451::I beat my mushroom tip, while watching Rosie O'Donnel masturbate.
legendjr_27::She's hot!! Did you know she was once Miss Wisconsin?
WIstormchaser2119::Porn isn't degrading, people are
BCowsill2451::Hulk Hogan
Brewcrewtilldeath20::Dave Bush
legendjr_27::Milwaukee is now 13-11 and 6-6 on the road. They need to lose 2 games at home to maintain their mediocre status or risk getting kicked out of Wisc.
MTigers4Ever::5th now
legendjr_27::Tied for 2nd.
MTigers4Ever::or that
MTigers4Ever::Not sure, I checked it like 2 weeks ago an they were, it may have changed.
legendjr_27::Are they?
MTigers4Ever::I thought bucks were #1 in their division?
Brewcrewtilldeath20::"Wait, I have to go to class?" - Todd Mayo
WIstormchaser2119::"Class? I thought I was here to play basketball" - Fab Melo
Jeremy Lin Superstar::Chris Broussard = Worst Reporter Of All Time  :-P

BCowsill2451::Damn bro, you sure do know a lot of porn stars.  How many bottles of lotion do you go through a week?
BCowsill2451::lol.  You are a success story.
nmsadler::I know every single one he's posted. I got through 3 bottles of lotion. But what does my dry skin have to do with that?
WIstormchaser2119::haha none, i have a good memory, i quit the addiction
BCowsill2451::A french Hooker with a prosthetic leg.
nmsadler::I already said Sarah Palin.

WIstormchaser2119::Carolyn Reese
buckspackers23::Good Game, Grizzlies fans. Wasn't as bad as it could've been. It was pretty much a given we'd lose this game. Just gotta continue beat these east coast. 11-5 in conference, 2-6 against the west.
Brewcrewtilldeath20::Miguel Tyrell
springfresh3.1::I was going through some of my parent old porn stash.  Christy Canyon had some huge knockers and a hairy mound
Jeremy Lin Superstar::Why was this game even on TV?  Rather watch LAC  :-P
WIstormchaser2119::Madison Ivy
MTigers4Ever::Whatd be a better game to buy tickets to, Griz vs. Nuggets or Griz vs. 76ers?
hyzerflippin::Nuggets.  Gallinarri will prob hit 15 3 pointers.
nmsadler::Nuggets because it's a western game. But if you have the chance I'd say Clippers. Best environment of any Griz game Ive ever been to.
wkdavis85::You should check out a grizz vs thunder game
slapshotcity123::Nuggets
GoTigers2015::Nuggets, since they typically play the Grizz well
MTigers4Ever::Ill prob do that then.. i got a few more days in Memphis an wanna catch a good Griz game before I have to leave.
springfresh3.1::good game Grizz
WIstormchaser2119::Megan Reece
08bulldogs::GNG
Russle021::wow 2nd half under was in jeapardy at the end there
Fat_tard_rules.::Not bad.  Could have been a lot worse.  Bucks fans shouldn't be too upset or let down.  13-11 and still in the hunt for the division.  Good luck the rest of the way Bucks fans!
dwyanewadeblockedyourfavoriteplayer3.0::Who is this fatass anchor on SCenter?
RecoIsMEMPHIS::yea the deers just got haunted and beat down holla!!!
roy2daboy::Ready for Friday's game against the Mavs now.  Hopefully, the Grizz can squeeze Juice dry.
WIstormchaser2119::Lisa Ann
nmsadler::Sarah Palin?
GoTigers2015::Lisa Ann is smarter than Sarah, don't insult her like that
