RunTheBall22_-::Howard just out rebounded the entire heat team before the game even started. wow
Djuki 3::congrats on the impressive win over the Raptors
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I think Duro was being sarcastic
RunTheBall22_-::i missed it but it did sound like an exciting game. good to see Deng hit that game winner
When Keeping it Real Goes Wrong.::ROR
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I doubt jokes with the lakers are not gonna work man... it's the lakers they are playing.
RunTheBall22_-::no way. Howard has always given the heat problems and led some not so good magic teams to beat the heat. i actually see the lakers winning
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Still though..........not that I root for the Heat, but there's no argument who will win this game.  There's maybe a 5% chance lakers win.
Djuki 3::night maybe?
RunTheBall22_-::heat do not match up well. Howard can and probably will dominate and that could make for a long night for the heat

funkingonut::nba is the worst - what is your icon?

nba is the worst::Jorts
Djuki 3::because he used to be a Knick?
cbbaseball19::Mike!
nba is the worst::5ammy5ammy5ammy In my opinion, the Lakers' defense is actually a little underrated. I know some of you will think I'm crazy, but I can see them holding Miami to about 85 points.    I have no idea what's going to happen in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters, though.
nba is the worst::Why would that get removed?  smh
nba is the worst::Just cut/pasting a board legend
cbbaseball19::Sticking up for the Heat for once!
Djuki 3::lolllllllll!
When Keeping it Real Goes Wrong.::i still dont understand the whole girlfriend ordeal.  so he didnt have a gf.  why is that news?
