Tdogz97::too bad they cant play like this agaist the elite
killahs_ghost::No one plays like this against the elite. That's why they're elite.  Try to keep up.
gpxking::Glad to see the Warriors honor Mr. Chamberlain's historic achievement from 50 years ago.  Funny, Wilt would have outscored 13 of the 22 teams that played on the anniversary. More impressively, his 1962 season will not be approached again - the points, the rebounds, the minutes played ( a staggering 48.5) ... And let's not forget his leadership on two of the greatest championship teams in NBA history - 67' Sixers and 72' Lakers that won 33 games in a row!  There was no 'wilt' in this Goliath! Hard to believe he's been gone over 12 years.
Bill Brushfire::Whoever wrote this has the situation all wrong. I had court-side seats last night and nobody was cheering for big macs. The crowd realized the team hadn't broken 100 points in a while. They saw it as a nice tribute to "The Stilt" by hitting 100 on the anniversary of the performance. Don't belittle us writer who has not been named.

Sixers1234567::The Sixers are the best team in the league and the sooner you trolls realize that the better.
Gimpay::man, what did everyone expect? two starters that combined 0-1 shooting for the warriors... philly was gonna win even if they played with 5 guys. you can't start two guys who won't even shoot and expect another team to respect your offense.
Goon-::50 years Wilt's mark has stood. Have a feeling it will be another 50 until someone gets close to that.
Oaktown1029::I was close, I had Philly 104 GS 85 - check it out, 10 minutes before the game.
Anthony Davis Unibrow Countdown::Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
MadmanMark14::The Warriors would have beat the 76ers if they has Melo, case and point, they lost tonight and its because he wasnt on the floor to close out the game
Blazelover13::You just keep telling yourself that. I'll wait for the mental institute to take you away.
Blazelover13::Beautiful way for the Sixers to win. Not only breaking that 19-game streak of not scoring 100 points by SCORING 100 points, but doing it on the night where they honor the greatest game in the history of basketball. Wilt, this game was for you. Great game Sixers, and good luck against the Bulls. You'll win, but you'll need this type of effort against them.   Oh, and Magic? You're an idiot. The Pacers, Magic and Knicks are NOT all better than the Sixers; I don't care WHAT you say. You shouldn't be an analyst, because nothing you say makes any sense. What a joke.
mmostello::Good win for the Sixers. I just got back from it. LOVED the Wilt 100 point game stuff! Shame David Lee didn't get T'd up for running mouth at the refs and crying all night. What a human t@mpon.
3_ai_76::Evan Turner needs more playing time, he Was the 2nd overall pick....He should be running point when he's on the floor because he looks to pass first every time. Seeing some plays designed for him would also be nice
Orange602::Wrong board
philliesrock14::76ers ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT
Jerry Meals::LE BROWNIE will be a perfect FIT in Phil
AlexanderBrovechkin::Yeah, but... Golden State owns the record.
rustyburg::Curious...did they retire Chamberlain's number in Golden State?
AlexanderBrovechkin::They bought Chamberlain's 100-point game along with the Philadelphia Warriors organization.
matjon1029::I don't get no matter how much the Sixers win by nobody still talks about them but rather say the magic pacers and knicks are better
mmostello::Pacers? Playa please.
T-rose724::damn if philly could rebound on 2k12..
leerey14::gonna go watch tosh.0 and his flamboyant outfit. Later.
kkawesome50::lou is so scary when he gets hot!

richfinshu2::Thank you Lou, that's 1700 for the over, and I sweated out about 7 lbs, good night lol
ycpchamp88::good for you...i called the under for someone earlier on his parlay and was feeling bad on that run at the end.  he survived tho
richfinshu2::I had the over at 188.5 at my sportsbook, bought 2 points down to 186.5...WHEW!
ycpchamp88::what was the over?  i thought it was 189

dwbrayton::*buns
trhqk3::IT's a BIg MAC... Not just a burger!
FlyGuys623::young lol
DaKing0325_::Philly has to keep the ship afloat till Hawes is fully healthy, because with him this team is an absolute contender
rustyburg::Think about what you just said...Hawes makes them a contender?  He definitely improves the team, but they are not contenders this year.  A very good team, should make the 2nd round, but not a contender.
T-rose724::if philly could get a decent center they would be dangerous
T-rose724::hawes is serviceable but don't think he is key
Frank Reynolds 6::For them is was doing really good
Frank Reynolds 6::If the guy we have could stay healthy it would help
FlyGuys623::blake griffin's commercials are really lame
DaKing0325_::tell me about it
T-rose724::truth
FlyGuys623::come on guys stop screwing around. get the 100 points
richfinshu2::they don't care, it's all screwing around now
dwbrayton::Did someone from GS steal Lance Stephensons yellow shoes?
shellcup0107::Brand can be a real bum
Frank Reynolds 6::Dude works but he is just totally overpaid
FlyGuys623::of smooth sweet lou
Cube93::Trade Ellis to Boston for Allen and some First rounders
Cube93::Ellis is a head case Allen is a much better player
Cube93::Allen could play till he is 45 thats how good of shape he is in
FlyGuys623::who will retire soon
FlyGuys623::you dont want that
WarriorsWarrior::Don Nelson wud have 5 more wins...easy!
Gimpay::and would've ruined k. thompson already
WarriorsWarrior::Good Game 76er Fans
