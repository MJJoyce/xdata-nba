Kyle Miller::7-29 here we come!!!!!
Yon Bevans::the worst shooting percentage game is about to take place in nba history starring K D
George Miche'l Reynolds::I wonder why people do not say Durant is getting all the calls like they say about Lebron
Arvin Ramroop::39 years old and still hustling.. that's Derek Fisher for ya. :)
Mickey Hughes::33 pts on 8 made shots....
Yon Bevans::NO MVP FOR KD HE IS NOT
Mickey Hughes::Doesn't the player that shoots the most FT's win the MVP?
Matt Beggs::27pts 5rebs 4asts good night for KD
Mickey Hughes::And 20 FT's
King Bob::These last few games for OKC have been horrible. It just seems like they are missing something, like defense.
Justin McElhaney::Could it be because they are missing a player called  Westbrook..hard to fill a role of a top 10 player...
Stefan Persack::Haven't the Bucks been rebuilding for the past like 18 years?
Marcleen Bavogui::no hate but how many fts does KD average seriously this is crazy
Eriko Jim::Thunder need more garbage role players if they hope to make another championship run..they need Shawn Marion type  to defend and rebound...they can't be beating teams by scoring 105+ points most nights
Justin McElhaney::There should be no argument who the MVP leader is...KD avg more points,rebounds,steals and blocks then Lebron and doing it in less minutes...
Mickey Hughes::First he's not even close to Lebron in ast "false"...second,  scoring its taken KD almost 200 more shts to make fewer baskets, just more FT's...even more than Howard which should be impossible that has jacked his #'s up -and he still only shooting 48% to Lebron's 60%
Andrew Corley::KD plays about a minute more per game. Idk where you're getting this "in less minutes" thing.
Bryan Roach::Mickey Hughes - Durant takes shots while Lebron makes layups and dunks because his shot is laughable.
Will Bernanke::WOW  FREE MONEY WITH THUNDER - 15,   THIS WAS AN EASY READ AS THE BUCKS ARE THE WORST NBA ROSTER SINCE THE LATE 80'S CLIPPERS WHO LOST 70 GAMES
MaPa Law::Can't work out why Adams isn't get more minutes... he needs them if they want him ready for the playoffs.
Shawn Bento::KD with 7 assists.  But he's selfish, doesn't pass, and doesn't make his teammates better.
Cvete Karamacoski::Antentokounmpo looks very promising, just needs to work on his shot
Yon Bevans::THE ONLY THING GOING ONN IN THE GAME IS TIME OUTS GREAT COACHING
Will Bernanke::THANKS YOU BUCKS,  YOU HAVE PAID MY BILLS FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS!!!
Anthony Wing::in reality: "okc schedule helps stop 2 game skid"
Connor Nordstrom::smdh c'mon all you gotta do is cover 11 points OKC cmon
Kyle Miller::Larry Sanders is on pace for 40+ rebounds.
Evan Hollnagel::not anymore lol
Kyle Miller::Lol. Looked promising in the beginning.
Evan Hollnagel::Kyle Miller no kidding, both teams shooting was atrocious lol
Yon Bevans::okc thunder is a joke are they giving away
William Cooper::Until Westbrook returns.
Justin McElhaney::They are playing without Westbrook...kinda of hard for someone to fill the shoes of a top 10 player...enough said...
Craig Peterson::Justin McElhaney  Excuses, excuses, are we going to have to listen to this excuse every time they lose till he comes back. I haven't heard Clipper fans using the loss of Paul as an excuse.
Justin McElhaney::OKC bench scores 30 or more =WIN
Kris Abby Glasser::Why is Neal not playing?
