themightyrule10::whats cleveland?
Ryan192847::HATE to see Noah and Deng playing such long minutes.  I know it has to be done to win some of these games, but it's going to come back to haunt them (especially Noah, who's not built for that kind of consistent heavy use).  Thibodeau has always been excellent at managing his players' minutes, but this is the first time in his head coaching career when he hasn't had a super-deep bench and a consistent lead going into the fourth quarter.  I'm glad I don't have to make these sorts of decisions.
01Bulls4life::Am I the only Bulls fan that follows their team even after rough seasons?
YoungQuin88::Hell no bro! D Rose: " see that's what y'all not understanding right now. I'm ready to die on that court... Like DIE..." dat boy serious and I am too about DA Bulls!
01Bulls4life::Carlos Boozer scored 10 whole points.. OMG!!!! Watch out Kobe Boozer is about to break your record!
SFthomas1969::Ive been using a betting system called sportsbettingstar. Im making between 2-3k a month using this system. If you search "sports betting system" on google you will find out more how this system works. If your a bettor this system will make you money.
itz_john_man::The Cavs have some good talent and in my opinion and two future all stars in their back-court. NBA teams fluctuate year in and year out. I am a firm believer that this will be a top four east team in 2-3 years. As a New Yorker fan I am a huge fan of Dion Waiters. My Knicks finished 29-53 in the 2009-2010 season and people were saying we were destined to lose. Don't listen to it you guys have a bright future!    -Cheers!
itz_john_man::And DrawohWasHere, I think that you are right about the Cavs pieces. They need a small foward but I believe that a SF is easier to draft than most other positions. If you guys can get Nerlens Noel or C Zeller in the draft to play alongside Anderson and pick up a SF in free agency you guys will be a playoff team...
itz_john_man::As a Syracuse native, I watched Dion play in games and i practice. He will struggle as a rookie no doubt. But mark my words, he was no mistake. I actually think this last draft class was a very deep one. Dion just needs a good coach and a good point guard to calm him, he wants to be a star and has the making to be one if he works hard.
fanofstevenash::Waiters likely will struggle to remain in the league and was a huge mistake..
DrawohWasHere::FACT;    Waiters is the 2nd highest scorer for rookies.    And that's with less minutes per game then the top scorer.
DrawohWasHere::What's your excuse for him being one of the top rookies in the league?
DrawohWasHere::Thanks John.    IMHO The Cavaliers need a SF and a bench.    Although, this bench is getting a ton of minutes.    I like Tyler Zeller off the bench while he's making steady progress, but beyond him, there's not much else from the bench.    Boo.bie Gibson can be a good piece as a SG specialist, but he's counted on to far more and score a lot more than what he's been able to provide.
DrawohWasHere::W/o Kyrie AND Waiters, this team will have a tough time beating anyone.    On the good side of things, good to see Tyler Zeller continue to improve even though he had an off night shooting %.
DrawohWasHere::oh... and another double double by the Wild Thing.    Although, Noah had basically the same night, they pretty much cancel each other out.
CHITOWNBULLS1991::Cavs are on the rise. They will be contenders in a year or two, they really aren't that far off.
DrawohWasHere::best wishes with your team as well.
CHITOWNBULLS1991::Yeah I like the Cavaliers as well when they aren't playing the Bulls. Can't wait till both these teams get healthy and add some more players, the Central will be so powerful. I'm out though, gl the rest of the way!
DrawohWasHere::I usually root for the Bulls when the Cavs aren't playing.    they are both in a similar boat with key injuries.   BUT way further along then the Cavaliers.
CHITOWNBULLS1991::ya definitely. They have many solid pieces and will prob get another in this years draft. They just need to get some experience, and when that happens the Cavs will be good.
DrawohWasHere::Thanks.      I think there is a good, but extremely young core with this group.
YenxRenx::Cavs fail to the injury-decimated Bulls.. LOL..yata can't use the injury card because the Bulls are missing far more talent than the Cavs are. Some teams are simply born to lose and the Cavs are one of those teams. Cavs wer out-shot, outscored, out rebounded at both ends,  out blocked....the Cavs didn't do ANYTHING right.hahahahha. that Anderson Vaginao guy got owned!!  Typical  Cavs game.
YenxRenx::Most Cavs fans claim I'm trolling when I predict failure for the Cavs and YET I'm right the vast majority of the time! Can't blame a guy for telling it like it is...
DrawohWasHere::you're a pathetic troll.     Completely pathetic.
CHITOWNBULLS1991::The Cavs are bad, but they weren't out stolen and actually had fewer turnovers.
Neil826::27-11 was the score after 1.  At home that truly is pathetic.
jomsulli::I know Thibs is a good coach and his understanding of defensive schemes is off the charts, but he can't keep playing his starters 42 or 44 minutes a night. Luol had 47 minutes the other day in a game that ended in regulation! I mean c'mon it's an 82 game season that would be like handing a running back the ball 30 times a game and expecting him to hold up.
The Bat of Adam Dunn::True, but he also probably doesn't trust the bench at all right now. Plus, last night Jimmy and N-Rob played over 30 minutes, while Hinrich and Belinelli only played 24.  So they played less tonight, but they averaged out.  Lu can't really be helped - he's a minutes hog.  He's played more this year than in the past, but his average this year is under 41. Last year it was 39.4, so it's not THAT much more.
ovechkinsgoal::the bulls are odd...on paper, they aren't anything exciting, but they manage to be 9-8.  good coaching.
The Bat of Adam Dunn::Holy Belinelli!
losheatsonlosmejores15::Oh $@%!!!  Bulls still play??
CHITOWNBULLS1991::Also, member since June 19th,2012? lmao bandwagoner.
The Bat of Adam Dunn::Yeah, growing up in the Chicagoland area, I don't really have any excuses to not be a Bulls fan.  I was pretty young for the first three-peat, but was old enough to remember and watch most of the games for the second three-peat.  Then I was old enough to struggle through watching the Bulls start Jamal Crawford and Marcus Fizer and Dickey Simpkins and Lonny Baxter and... I'm going to stop now before I start crying.
CHITOWNBULLS1991::all good, If you're a fan of the Bulls right now you're not a bandwagon fan!
The Bat of Adam Dunn::I would add to this, but unfortunately my name is newer than that. Stupid ESPN, blocking my account from posting for CALLING THEM OUT ON DOING A TERRIBLE JOB OF REPORTING.
The Bat of Adam Dunn::Yep. Currently undefeated against the Wizards this year too.
CHITOWNBULLS1991::lmao owned.
dnels97::Why didn't waiters play??
FoxKat93::I believe he was injured...ankle.
FoxKat93::Nate's a solid pick up if you don't play him in the fourth--he gets trigger happy.
NoahGunsHolsters::I agree
Sherriann Ryan::there is only one place the bulls need to adress this year and that is a back up center. the rest are good enough to see the curent season out
relawe13::Finally thibs realized nate goes full r.e.t.a.r.d and yanked him.
Sherriann Ryan::i will be pretty happy next year when nate is playing for another team
Jaywashing::Eh, he's valuable in spurts...well-measured and controlled spurts.   But he's certainly not someone you want to rely on.
YaImFromCleveland::Tank you very much Chicago
Sherriann Ryan::2014 we have jo,derrick, marquis, and jimmy on the books and that is it
mvp9494::.
Sherriann Ryan::the year after is more of a possibility the buy out figure is more realistic plus he can resign for a mid level contract instead of his rookie wage which is a lot less than what he is getting now
NoahGunsHolsters::No Deng :( so sad...
NoahGunsHolsters::That's true...really I just don't want to see him go.
Sherriann Ryan::NoahGunsHolsters - For some reason I don't think the Bulls FO will give up Deng.  they will if he doesn't come cheap enough plus he makes a good expiring contract for trade bait
NoahGunsHolsters::For some reason I don't think the Bulls FO will give up Deng.
CHITOWNBULLS1991::no Taj?
NoahGunsHolsters::Taj?
Sherriann Ryan::my bad taj now as well
BABY IGGY..MELO IS STILL FAT::with boozer amnestied we are still over the cap i believe
Sherriann Ryan::1 mill under
yata-9arasu::Lol.  They will lining up for that 1 mil.
Sherriann Ryan::the only loss from last years team is asik, but with the money houston threw at him it would have destroyed the bulls chances of signing any decent free agents if they had have resigned him
CHITOWNBULLS1991::Plus we already have Noah for the heavy minutes
CHITOWNBULLS1991::yeah prob would have been better than Mohammad, but dunno.
Sherriann Ryan::i have been saying for a while i wish they had have gone out on a limb and signed thabett or whiteside
Sherriann Ryan::the bulls traded korver away to atlanta to save some money and cj signed for the league min in bkn aswell as ronnie brewer signed for the min in ny. a couple of years time you will thank the bulls for saving cash now so they can spend later
BABY IGGY..MELO IS STILL FAT::They signed hinrich, FAIL
Sherriann Ryan::he is a stop gap
Can-I-Get-A-Hot-Tub::That's what CHI said 2 years ago, then they threw out the bench and said we'll spend later.
mvp9494::I think he will be able to  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1364851-why-chicago-bulls-fans-should-be-salivating-for-nikola-mirotics-arrival
mvp9494::check out the article, hes playing against the raptors. Ya i know its the raptors but still nba talent
Sherriann Ryan::it all good ripping it up in europe, but really doesn't count for much when you get to the big time nba
NoahGunsHolsters::and we get Mirotic
Sherriann Ryan::yeah, just hope he can play in this league
Kit Ramsey::Would some of u please stop talking about the overrated bench mob from last year, that only helped to get a good regular season record, NOT THE PLAYOFFS, as u witnessed 2 years in a row, u need toughness and scoring in the playoffs which NONE of the bench mob provided, so shut up about that crap and move on.
rickyny70::No u shut up bulls have 6 rings all with MJ &amp; yes im  a smartass lol
ScalabrineSwag::Brewer and watson provided mental toughness late in games and on defense. Also see my comments below regarding last years playoffs.
Kit Ramsey::Dude shut up, they didn't, then why don't the Bulls have any rings?
Sherriann Ryan::well said
NoahGunsHolsters::All I want for Christmas is Bulls season tickets.
NoahGunsHolsters::and a ship or two ;-)
ScalabrineSwag::Regarding the sixers series last year:  When bench players are forced into starters roles they are less effective. Plus, starters on the sixers should be better than the bench players on the bulls.
Romania Chicago::its been a tough season for the bulls but its seems like they'll win the central
HunterF4444::You think this is tough? Try being a Cavs fan
YenxRenx::It's tough being a Cavs fan because you suffer the guilt from supressing the fact that the Cavs suck and that they are likely the worst franchise... in the worst city... with the worst fans in the NBA...  Hunter why don't you just come out and admit it? Admit it in here every day and you'll feel better.
HunterF4444::hopefully in a year or two
Romania Chicago::im telling you its gonna be a great rivalry with both teams healthy
Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA
Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::Right now the Bulls would be the #4 seed. So if they won their first round series they would play the #1 seed.. Either Miami or the Knicks?
yata-9arasu::The Bulls defense alone will get them a top 5 seed.  Rose is huge.
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::na, no way in hell we are the #7 or #8 seed
ScalabrineSwag::we good as long as we dont get a first round matchup with the heat
Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA
yata-9arasu::Irving:  23 PPG/6 APG/ 3 RPG on 47%/40%3P/87% FT Jennings:  17 PPG/6 APG/ 3 RPG on 41%(career high LMAO)/37% 3P/80% FT  Not even close really.
YenxRenx::God, the Cavs sucked in this one. They were playing an injury-decimated Bulls team and basically lgot sh.it on in every aspect of the game. Man , that's embarrassing.
Romania Chicago::havent heard from jennings since that 55 point game
Romania Chicago::nate as a sixth man is very good, thats why we'll be so good when rose come back so nate wont have to shoot so much in the 4th quarter
ScalabrineSwag::nate should move to SG when rose comes back
ScalabrineSwag::then he would have the ball in his hands less too.
Romania Chicago::tru
ScalabrineSwag::Watson was better than hinrich and nate combined
Kit Ramsey::Please, Watson stinks, just ask the Sixers.
FoxKat93::Ehh...if Nate works on his control, he'll be a pretty solid pick up. Kirk just needs to shoot better.
ScalabrineSwag::watson shot the ball better too...nate gets on little hot streaks where he doesnt miss but watson was more consistent
FoxKat93::ScalabrineSwag - both are turnover machines  That's why I said that Nate needs to work on control. I think most of his TO's comes from acting and not thinking.
ScalabrineSwag::both are turnover machines
BABY IGGY..MELO IS STILL FAT::We could get to the ECF if we don't have to face the heat before the ECF, with rose we can beat the knicks, c's and just about anyone else except the heat

Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA
Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::Anybody think the Bulls can make a run in the postseason when MVP comes back??
FoxKat93::"We need to rest Rose the whole year, so we can get a good lottery pick."  ...you know it's coming.
ScalabrineSwag::depends how well he plays when he gets back
Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA
NoahGunsHolsters::Did Noah play the whole game?
FoxKat93::Basically.
FoxKat93::It is, but it was the foul trouble and ineffectiveness of some players.
NoahGunsHolsters::Unacceptable especially against this team.
Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA

Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA
Romania Chicago::shut up
CutlerToMarshallAllDayAndNight2012::ScalabrineSwag we screwed up getting rid of korver brewer and watson  no the player I most the most is Asik. Korver isn't that good, Jimmy Butler will be better than Brewer, and C.J. Watson is just a little better than Nate. Only difference is, C.J. has discipline and never shot his team out of a game
ScalabrineSwag::brewer was the best role player in the league. he could shoot, make cuts, play defense and force turnovers. Huge mistake by the bulls.
Kit Ramsey::Brewer sucked, good riddance!
FoxKat93::He shot better, but he was shooting less as well, which is never a good thing on the Bulls.
Romania Chicago::i like butler better, he has a brighter future
Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA
Terrance26611::BULLS SHOULD PICK UP AJIRNA
Kit Ramsey::I told u that Marco can play, that's what he did last year with N.O, he just needs the minutes. But let's see if stubborn a-z-z Thibs continue to let this guy play and get him in with the starters instead of with the ballhog Nate.
FoxKat93::Marco and Nate play different positions. Nate does make bad decisions, but he has been a valuable player as well.
ScalabrineSwag::rather see jimmy start than bellinelli
Kit Ramsey::Then u are a complete IDIOT!

rag63top::Best players in the division.  1) Rose 2)Irving

Archie Mannings Stray Dog::1) Rose 2) Jennings
HunterF4444::efficiency most importantly.
Archie Mannings Stray Dog::how so?
yata-9arasu::Irving&gt;Jennings
Archie Mannings Stray Dog::nah
HunterF4444::Irving&gt;Jennings all day
