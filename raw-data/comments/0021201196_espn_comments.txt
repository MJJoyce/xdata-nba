RichardtheRabbit::They're not just throwing up 3 pointers like some cinderella team in the NCAA tournament, They get open 3's when they're playing well and they hit them.
rg3uknowme::History tends to repeat itself, and that tells us that Melo will be lucky to get out the first round.  If KG and PP were healthy I would bet a lot of money on the Celtics.  Melo's game just doesnt translate to playoff basketball.  Go ahead and drop 35 in some dog-day games at the end of the regular season. Defenses will key in on the knicks role players and make Melo beat them , which he has proven he cannot do
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::So what, should the Knicks just pass up open 3 pointers?
Snuff-A-Luffagus::People that don't watch games and just look at box scores think so
DWoe23::good news for pacers and knicks. They know they wont have to play the nets or the bucks in this years playoffs...
bballjogguy31::good for the most part.
knicks_112ndcoming::is that good or bad?
Master Van Perro::Knicks aren't threatening.   You can't live by the 3 in the playoffs.  I foresee an early exit.
wilmaso::live and die by the three is not good but when you create the space they do and are open like they are .....it's not live and die ...it's a strategy.
jroc21::Especially when those threes come by the way of a pass out of a double team.  It gets the defense scrambling and creates open shots.
rg3uknowme::Your referring to average defenses that you will play night in and night out in the NBA.  Trust me when I tell you that the Bulls and Heat won't be scrambling defensively to guard the Knicks. They will stay home, let Melo get his 30 (If he continues to be as efficient as of late) and shut down everyone else. Novak will not get an open look the entire series against a good defensive team
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I love when people say we "live by the 3".  Knicks are top 5 in OFFENSIVE EFFICIENCY.  Offenses don't become efficient by only shooting 3's
jroc21::Miami led the league in 3 pointers last year I believe.
sports_IQ::MIA is Top 5 in 3pts this year and broke the Finals record in makes/percentage to beat OKC...so yeah, it seems to work fine when you only want it to for certain teams...
Heatle Beatle::Miami was 20th in the league on made three pointers, try again  http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/team/_/stat/offense-per-game/sort/avgThreePointFieldGoalsMade/year/2012
rainmaker2007::That's how the Heat make up large deficits. It works.
DWoe23::they also lead the league in minutes played by two bad a$$ players in the playoffs too.
jroc21::How about Mike Woodson for coach of the year (Probably going to George Karl) and Jr Smith for 6th man. I think Melo should get a few votes for MVP, that's probably wishful thinking though.
Infamousdough1988::He aint no damn coach of the year.
bballjogguy31::Lebron's prolly going to get the MVP award another year so don't give your hopes up.
rg3uknowme::Probably? if its not unanimous then there is a problem
Snuff-A-Luffagus::He deserves it over Karl
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I was actually thinking about that this weekend when I heard Van Gundy say Karl should get it.  The fact that NY locked up a #2 seed from #7 last yr is a big improvement.  The fact that he did it with a majority of the roster hurt this yr is even more impressive to me
jroc21::I agree...I was thinking the same thing.
Balkibartocomus::Knicks sweep Boston. They've got NO chance. I predict game one's gonna be a complete blowout
Balkibartocomus::the key to success (at least offensively) is JR Smith. Everyone's gonna have one gameplan. KILL MELO. JR's gotta be able to step up when they do.
Balkibartocomus::attack the basket. That's what we need to do. JR and Felton need to really get points in the paint. Copeland could be the Xfactor if they do hammer JR. I liked him at the center spot. Drawing bigs out the paint
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::yeah he's definitely deserving of more minutes.  I think the only thing stopping Woodson from going all in on Copeland is the lack of defense
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I think JR is gonna get a lot of attention too, especially against a team like MIA with more than 1 good perimeter defender.  I'd go even further and say they keys on offense are Shumpert, Felton, Copeland, and Novak, or a combo of 2 of the 4
Balkibartocomus::so how does Woodson's projected bench look like for the Playoffs? I hear everybody (with the exception of Stat) will be available
Balkibartocomus::we could use Stat against the Celtics. He seems to play well against them
Snuff-A-Luffagus::He got waived
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::he is, he's just on IR
Balkibartocomus::Kurt's no longer with the team though
Balkibartocomus::Kurt? you mean Solomon Jones
Snuff-A-Luffagus::Kurt was waived
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::Kurt Thomas is still one of the best 10 post defenders in the league.  Thats really all he and Camby are good at nowadays, that's the only reason they're still in the league.
Balkibartocomus::Stat says perhaps the second round he'll be ready. Do we play him if he is?
Snuff-A-Luffagus::Yes, it's a no brainer  He's the 7th man
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I don't know man. I'm a big Amare fan, but I say no.  If we make it to the ECF maybe, but not as soon as rd 2 unless he's really needed.  I think if we can get Camby and Kurt back then they plug the holes defensively.  Copeland is proving he should be getting more minutes anyways...just needs to play better D
NGplayinskillz::The NY Knicks ain't winning nothing this year. The Knicks probably have the hardest road to the NBA championship of anybody in the league. They probably have to get past Boston, Indiana, Miami, and whoever comes out the West (OKC or SA?). They not beating all of those teams.
Snuff-A-Luffagus::"The NY Knicks ain't winning nothing this year."   SO you think they're going to win i see
strongisland06::Just worry about the pacers.
Balkibartocomus::which will make it even sweeter.
knicks_112ndcoming::2nd  in east as the oldest team in the league  53 wins with almost key players injured all season  Atlantic division champs. only team to win in OKc, Miami and SA  Best season in probably 19 years.
NYDFENSE::I was about to add that the Knicks have a great bench, but then I became a bit confused as I tried to identify the "bench".  I've watched almost every game this year and I believe, with the exception of J.R. Smith, every man on the roster has started at one point.  Maybe STAT didn't!?  Even Solomon Jones started in his second game!
strongisland06::With the injuries the Knicks had they would not be in the position they are now without a great bench.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::sub1200:  "Knicks and "team defense" are three words not normally seen together." -------------------------------  Actually, when the Knicks were winning earlier in the season they were top 10 in defensive efficiency.  During the stretch that Woodson took over last year, NY was top 3 in defensive efficiency.  Defensive efficiency is primarily a team statistic, i.e. they played very good team defense
RayNy2ATL::I truly believe the defense comes back in the playoffs. I think human nature on the players behalf is the reason they slipped defensely. They saw that they were still winning so the emphasis that was there early faded a bit since you have guys that historically arent defense-minded. But they showed they are capable of it so its just a matter of committing to it again, its not a fluke.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::yeah I hope you're right.
tripleoptik::Virulent strain of diarrhea
srqlegend1::what do you think changed between now and then?
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::that's the bigger question, and to be honest I don't have the answer.  Part of me thinks Woodson is getting lax, and because the team is still winning overall he's letting it slide...Maybe Tyson being out all of those games messed up their defensive focus.  I don't know, but I don't like it lol.  I also don't like that even though NY is a top 5 offensive efficient team, our assists are way lower than they could/should be
tripleoptik::Anyone else have a feeling that all these melo haters were Also iverson haters?  Also anyone that likes hip hop. Or has corn rows.
tripleoptik::I just think a lot of them are raycess
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I just think they're bored/easily persuaded by whatever the popular trend is.  More than likely they are Heat "fans", because its cool to be now...either that or OKC.  They also typically spout out "Melo has never made it out of the 1st round" either ignoring or just being ignorant to the fact that he made it to the West finals one yr
strongisland06::Haters = idiots
jdot3mpny::Melo locked up boy George but i bet no one will mention that
DWoe23::you mad bro? George locked up melo last time they played, so its about even. in other words, not worth mentioning
Bulls to the Finals::Key to beating Knicks, just show up.
Prospect_417::Oh I get it.  You're just a clown trying to get people worked up.  Carry on lol.
srqlegend1::what were the biggest problems with the knicks during the isiah years?
Bulls to the Finals::Just like now, no team players except for kidd and Chandler.
Prospect_417::Everything.
srqlegend1::hahahahah  i mean if you had to boil it down to one or two significant reasons, what would they be?
Prospect_417::Good to see the Knicks win that game and secure # 2.  They have to play their best ball of the season to make some real noise in the playoffs.  Can't sleep on anyone including Boston, regardless of them being the 7 seed, they know how to turn it up a notch in the postseason.
Bulls to the Finals::Celtics in 7 and Carmelo winds up with zero assists in 2 of the losses.
Prospect_417::lol, why do people insist on their so called predictions?  It's one thing to call the series in however many games but assists for a specific player? Give it a break.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::they're going to miss Rondo.  NY in 5
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::That being said, I don't think any of the games (maybe 1) will be blowouts
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I think BOS would need at least 3-4 huge games out of Jeff Green, and I don't think he's ready for that.  That would put KG and PP in a predicament, as I think their age is finally catching up to them
Prospect_417::I hope you're right, I'm just saying.
myboyvinniechase::pacers &gt; knicks  its been confirmed
NGplayinskillz::The Pacers beat the NY Knicks by 34pts. The Knicks won 1 game at the end of the season by 10pts. Hardly an accomplishment by the Knicks.
Prospect_417::I hope that's sarcasm.
rainmaker2007::Well I guess the Knicks silenced all those naysayers and Pacers fans yesterday.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I think the keys to a series against MIA are as follows: 1.  Shumpert must limit Wade while averaging at least 10-15 ppg himself. 2.  Team defense in the paint.  Bosh's perimeter shooting will stretch the floor and force Tyson out of the post on defense. 3.  Melo and LBJ have to be a wash offensively (i.e. Melo can't really have an off night unless LBJ does). 4.  Chalmers must be stopped.  Chalmers is doesn't usually do much, but he's known to have moments where he looks like he could start on any team.  And he's been shooting well from 3 lately

And he's been shooting well from 3 lately  There won't be a Knick series against the Heat, Knicks one and done.
rainmaker2007::Good points. I would add that Novak has to show up. If he pulls a James Harden-in the finals last year- the Knicks can't beat Miami. Melo v LeBron / Smith v Wade will, as you said, be a wash. Novak has to have a big series.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::agreed.  Didn't have enough space, but I wanted to go more into Novak and Copeland needing to play well.  Also JR has to keep attacking the paint
sub1200::Knicks and "team defense" are three words not normally seen together.
myboyvinniechase::haha nice analysis tim legler
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::lol the board seemed dead I'm just trying to spark some convo.  Its debateable, I just wanted opinions
Someone Keeps Moving My Chair::If the Knicks continue to play team ball and JR Smith keeps attacking efficiently the Knicks will be fine.  If they do what Denver did for 8 years and just watch Melo shoot the ball in the playoffs then the Knicks will fall victim to the same fate
Bulls to the Finals::Someone Keeps Moving My Chair - If the Knicks continue to play team ball and JR Smith keeps attacking efficiently the Knicks will be fine.  If they do what Denver did for 8 years and just watch Melo shoot the ball in the playoffs then the Knicks will fall victim to the same fate  Team ball? That's blasphemy.
Donnie Walsh::Yeah Ur Rite - This can't be the Melo Show or we're One &amp; Done !!
myboyvinniechase::or just done
Donnie Walsh::Cut Cancelled Flight White &amp; Pick up James Singleton !!
srqlegend1::charles oakley and anthony mason would make lebron cry, guaranteed
Someone Keeps Moving My Chair::Knicks match up well against the Heat.
Timmys Crossover136::How?  Average chalmers=average felton Wade&gt;Smith James&gt;the whole knicks team Melo&gt;Haslem No defense bosh=no offense chandler  Miami bench&gt;ny bench  Playoff experience and chemistry obviously in favor of the 305
Timmys Crossover136::In that case you will get beat by indy in 5
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::are we talking about this yr, or are we talking about this yr?
Timmys Crossover136::8-1
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::3 &gt; 1
anthony51073::hope we sweep those green leprechauns...hate everything boston,new england.....bunch of pansys
0nly_In_NY::bunch of cawk suckahs(boston accent)
GruDeN_GrinDeR::Rebounding and depth are 2 advantages the Knicks have over the Heat
Bulls to the Finals::GruDeN_GrinDeR - Rebounding and depth are 2 advantages the Knicks have over the Heat  Heat aren't playing the Knicks, Knicks will be long gone.
Donnie Walsh::The Knicks will INVOKE The Jordan Rules on LeHype!!!! No Layups - No Dunks &amp; No Uncontested Shots !! NO BLOOD &amp; NO FOUL !!!! And if U Drive The Lane - U Pick Ur Az Up Off Da Floor!!
0nly_In_NY::kenyon martin will make lebron cry 5 minutes into game 1
anthony51073::heat going to need a binkie for bron bron...
srqlegend1::knicks should draft mostly bigs in the draft this year  camby and martin are only good for this postseason and then they're toast
jdot3mpny::So who gaurds melo?
atlatsr::You knick fans are delusional. You have nobody that can defend the king. He will eat you alive. The heat are a different beast in the playoffs....but knick fans wouldn't know that being irrelevant the past zillion years.
Someone Keeps Moving My Chair::The Heat WERE good LAST YEAR in the playoffs. One year does not constitute an annual trend.   We will see if they can continue what they did last year.  It remains to be seen.
srqlegend1::shump can negate wade pretty well and i don't think bosh will do anything inside  with chandler there  i agree - no use in trying to negate lebron, nobody can. but even lebron can't win a game on his own if the rest of the team is locked down.
anthony51073::u are delusional...u mean the queen
0nly_In_NY::ok, you dont have anyone that can guard melo
knicks_112ndcoming::heat were no where to be found until past 6 years.  know some history bout the knicks first
GruDeN_GrinDeR::U let Lebron do what he has to do, but try to contain the rest of the team
anthony51073::the one position that worries me is pg....felton is too inconsistant...if he brings it...knicks beat anyone....big IF he brings it.
GruDeN_GrinDeR::He's been solid lately. But agreed... when he's on, the Knicks are a tough team to beat
GruDeN_GrinDeR::Knicks will beat Bos in 5
atlatsr::Celtics got this series. Knicks know there not as good as Boston. Melo will unravel by game 3 and this series will be over then.
atlatsr::How's the new Yorks playoff success been lately? Regular season means nothing. Now teams will really play d against Carmelo and he will cave like he always does in the playoffs. Celts in 6.
Someone Keeps Moving My Chair::Got to love the delusional hopeful
0nly_In_NY::knicks know they are not as good as boston? sorry but guys like jeff green and avery bradley dont strike fear into anyones heart
tripleoptik::Oh man. We're only allowed to play with one guard in the playoffs? Freal?
atlatsr::Avery Bradley will shut down your guard come playoff time. Book it. Then talk to me about what he brings.
anthony51073::thanks ms cleo
tripleoptik::I think she in the clink
srqlegend1::hahahaha i remember watching those commercials on tv  is she still around?
Donnie Walsh::LMAO !!!!
Someone Keeps Moving My Chair::All I know is deep down in places they do not like to talk about, the Heat and their fans are praying to God they don't see the Knicks in the playoffs.
Timmys Crossover136::Felton and melo at a buffet line would scare the shii out of anyone.
tripleoptik::Yea but hardaways salad and jon ameci tossin. That's a heat dream
anthony51073::the heat have fans ?
Someone Keeps Moving My Chair::I think there are about a half dozen true die hards out there.  Does Pat Riley count?
0nly_In_NY::yes, until lebron leaves, then they disappear
srqlegend1::how do you think melo will perform in the playoffs this year
GruDeN_GrinDeR::The dude is playing his best ball of his career  N the team is clicking at the right time... I think they'll be fine
anthony51073::as long as he is healthy....30 a game
GruDeN_GrinDeR::Knicks have the best bench in the Eastern Conference
srqlegend1::knicks strategy in the playoffs = grind out close games and tire out the opposition with good bench play
GruDeN_GrinDeR::That'll be one strength they'll have against Mia
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::Considering a lot of the people on our bench are starting now then yeah lol
Donnie Walsh::Gonna be a tough series against Celts - hopefully the Team is NOT looking as far ahead as some of your posts are indicating !!  Don't really care about MVP, Scoring Title or VIPs just win THE CHIP !!
0nly_In_NY::I dont see how any team can look ahead in the playoffs, especially the knicks right now. its a 7 game series against your rival who swept you 2 years ago. they are gonna be focused
Donnie Walsh::I hope so !!
0nly_In_NY::I hope sheed comes back but stays FAR away from the 3 pt line
anthony51073::we need all the big bodies we can get....the deeper the better
0nly_In_NY::absolutely, we just dont need him jacking up 3's..we need his good post offense and defense
Donnie Walsh::Def hear that !!
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::ChiefIlliniwek4Life "Please - you hear it every game on TV. Or are you going to tell me I was hearing things during his post game interview yesterday." ---------------------------- I don't live in NY, so honestly I didn't see the game (damn MSG network lol).  If they were chanting that, then that's just fan appreciation in the moment.  I don't think anyone can really look at Melo as an MVP this yr considering what LeBron has done statistically.  Maybe if his assists numbers were up
Someone Keeps Moving My Chair::So what you are saying is fans of a team watch their favorite and best player come through for them on a nightly basis in awesome fashion and they chant "MVP" and that makes you mad?   It happens in every sport for just about every team that has a great player playing great.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::not me, just responding to the guy that posted the comment.  I'm saying from a conversational standpoint, I think most people would say LeBron is the MVP this season.  From a fan standpoint, I'd be chanting MVP too if I was at the game
anthony51073::whats wrong with a home team chanting mvp?....lakers fan do it for kobe....ny fans do it for melo....heat bandwagon fans....well they only show up in the playoffs...thats hometeam showing love for their player....nothing wrong with that at all.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::I agree.
Someone Keeps Moving My Chair::LeBron is the best all round player on the best team in the NBA.  Melo is the best scorer in the NBA on a very good team.
anthony51073::now is a good time to rest melo and the rest of the injured players...the 2 is locked up....now lets get healthy and make this a playoff to remember...
knicks_112ndcoming::JR Smith (6th Man):  17.9 PPG  2.8 APG  5.3 RPG  PER of 17.30    Now, Joe Johnson (Starter):  16.3 PPG  3.5 APG  3.0 RPG  PER of 14.03    JR's Salary: 2.8 Million  Johnson's Salary: 19.8 Million
0nly_In_NY::if JR plays his best game, that is better than Joes best game
srqlegend1::joe johnson is awful. how did he get paid so much to begin with?
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::he's not awful per se, just EXTREMELY over paid.  ATL gave him all that money expecting him to do what he did in PHX, but that was with Nash, Amare, and Marion
anthony51073::he is not awful....dwilliams shoot too much for a point guard
Someone Keeps Moving My Chair::I wouldn't bet on the Knicks beating the Heat but I would not be surprised if they did.  In my mind, they are the only team in the east that could even consider the possibility.
srqlegend1::lets say NY pulls it off and actually wins the East  which match-ups from the West are you least and most concerned about?
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::Good question.  More concerned with OKC and LAC than SAS.  Even though we beat OKC, I don't trust what Durant would do knowing he has a small window to win as many rings as possible with the current roster.  LAC is also the deepest team in the West imo.  I'm not a believer in SA. I don't think they'll make it to the WCF
anthony51073::knicks matchup good with anyone from the west.....sa because of experience is tougher if they are healthy
knicks_112ndcoming::most probably OKC.   everyone else is slow paced. we can beat them in 7
ChiefIlliniwek4Life::Knicks fans think 'Melo is the MVP.  SMH.  THAT is how you know they're delusional.  Cheer for your team all you want.  But please, be realistic.
srqlegend1::i've always said there's a difference between best and most valuable.  if you're going by the former definition, lebron is a shoe-in for the award just about every season. but if lebron were out, miami would still be competing every year with wade and bosh. knicks wouldn't be going anywhere without melo. that's the difference.
eagles are forever ringlesss::if that was what it was based on, dirk would win it every year not melo
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::we haven't said that since the 1st 2 or 3 months of the season...nice try tho
ChiefIlliniwek4Life::Please - you hear it every game on TV.  Or are you going to tell me I was hearing things during his post game interview yesterday.
anthony51073::wow...u sound mad
ChiefIlliniwek4Life::'Bout what?
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::Heat2218:  "it's called having fun in sports. something you knicks fans will know nothing about." ------------------------------------------- Fun, like NY fans believing in their team which has improved tremendously over the last several seasons?  Or fun, like trolling a Knick's story and trying to get people to stop believing in their team because you wouldn't know what to do if that same team beat your's?
Timmys Crossover136::That new Evil Dead trailer scares me more than the knicks
0nly_In_NY::I cant wait til lebron goes to the lakers or back to the cavs so the heat can go back to having 12 fans and all of "heat nation" disappears
srqlegend1::i wouldn't be surprised if lebron goes back to cleveland in 2 years as kyrie is hitting his prime and while wade and bosh are old.
Heat2218::And I bet you think Melo was drafted by the Knicks.
0nly_In_NY::Heat2218 please come with a better comment than that next time..very weak
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::there's that fear we smelled again...classic "deflection" technique lol
srqlegend1::do you think marcus camby will be back in time? woodson says yes, but it's still up in the air.
srqlegend1::yeah true.  knicks need as many healthy bigs as possible going into the playoffs.
0nly_In_NY::yea it would be nice to have him healthy on the bench. it will let our bigs play more aggressive cause they dont have to worry about foul trouble
0nly_In_NY::even if hes back i dont see how he gets any PT with chandler,martin,melo and even cope(and possibly stat for 2nd round) playing up front. playoff rotations are supposed to be smaller (8-9 guys)
Heat2218::All of this afraid talk has me crying. Knicks fans are WISHING they win a rd. Heat fans KNOW our boys are headed to the FINALS!!!
bad8694::You can get pretty good money lines on that in Vegas.......So since you KNOW they will make the finals, bet your house on it   :)
srqlegend1::after the knicks sweep boston in the first round, what are trolls going to talk about then? they can't use their old-and-tried "haha knicks can't get out of the 1st round" fallback anymore!
Heat2218::it's called having fun in sports. something you knicks fans will know nothing about.
Heat2218::who betting money on espn
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::exactly why no one cares about "bets"...  You could make your background Knicks themed and stay off for a week.  Or you could just not do it and no one would care because we're not stalking you like that lol
Heat2218::lets place a bet on that!! if the knicks sweep I will put their wallpaper up for the entire 2nd rd.
CagedWisdomChangedMyLife::if it aint about money it don't make cents
