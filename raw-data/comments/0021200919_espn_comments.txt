Degenerate Drunk::I hate that I still think this team has playoff hopes.
denn19641::It's a free fall for the Pistons. Let this team get 5 more wins in the remaining 18 games for a better lottery position. We no longer have that luxury by next years draft.
KJsactown::Been following a bet system called Sportsbettingstar. I doubled my balance in less than a month and made over $3000 my 2nd month using this system. You can find the system on google by searching for sports betting systems. This system works and will make you money on your sprots bets
rl558163::eye roll
Tdavis2304::Getting fed up with pistons get it 2gether not making playoff but damn finish strong
flankton::GS is 7 games behind Memphis.  Dallas is 6.5 games behind GS.
Jeff 315::Following a bet system called sportsbettingstar the past few months. I doubled my intiial balance the first month and made almost $3000 my 2nd month just following this system. If you search google for basketball betting systems you can learn more about it there
joe snaid::9 for 30 on our home rims, our home rims.  C;mon, we battled, but we have to drop the bombs in our own backyard.   I love this team!!!  Once Drummond returns, then we get another big and then force the opposition to pick their poison.  Effort was good.  Effort plus poison equals wins. - SSIDE of Chicago. Gage Park.
rl558163::Poison didn't work out so well for Romeo and Juliet.....just sayin'
Pstnzballaz::I'd like to see Middleton play more after watching him tonight
TomLeee124::Dallas Dumb $@%!
Jerryintx88::your ugly  hairy legged  mom
NowitzkiHasAlwaysOwnedGarnett::Him Down Stairs1 the wolves have fans?... really... ---------------------------- actually now they're prolly gone, they are out in full force at the beginning of the year, resorting to saying how much "better" Minnesota sports are better than Dallas sports in general, saying Alexey Shved is going to be a perennial All-Star and all that great nonsense
NowitzkiHasAlwaysOwnedGarnett::no you're right he was hot at the beginning of the year, but he's cooled off to say the least.....he's a horrible distributor and his shot is the only thing that he's known for
IdBangLBJsMommaToo::shved has a shot.a becoming an all star tho. he got game
IdBangLBJsMommaToo::oh, i didnt know about that. just saw a few games where he really did good. its his first year, so ill give him a chance
NowitzkiHasAlwaysOwnedGarnett::he's shooting 37 percent, 29 from 3
IdBangLBJsMommaToo::mayo is clearly the best player on this team. he can do it all. future all star
rl558163::You're dumb!  Dirk can be on one leg and is still a better player....not a future all-star...a reigning all-star and MVP - He's older and coming off injury and still WAY more valued than OJ....C'mon fool
spacebump::he is turning into a better player but watch more mavs games, many times in crunch time he will make disastrous mistakes
Abner7716::He needs to improve his shooting and TO's at crunch time!
Philip3664::This woulda been a blowout loss if Frank was coaching. Gotta give Hill credit for getting them back in the game
TheJTram::gg, #FireLawerenceFrank, #KeepBrianHill, have a good one
smackdab0::woulda been nice had dirk played like that the whole game, cost me $30.
Justinkm83::He looked sick. He wasn't getting his normal touches.
smackdab0::even if we get a pick inside #9, i dont think we'll get another player as good as drummond is..
Abner7716::Thanks Dirk for those 2 big bombs!
torrtis::That was a great last ditch play drawn, too bad it didn't go in.
Justinkm83::Not really.
TheJTram::Keep Brian Hill, get Lawerence Frank out of here...
NowitzkiHasAlwaysOwnedGarnett::Great now we get the Wolves fans, I hate those freakin clowns on this site

Justinkm83::fadeaway 3?
Justinkm83::No you don't. They ran that same play twice, and missed them both. With the game on the line I want the shooter to face up.

smackdab0::stuckey is so bad.. just thought i'd throw that out there
Justinkm83::I'd give you a pair of socks for him.
Virginiatechmostnflplayers::i say trade him
Segasav25::don't draft Otto Porter
Segasav25::nah he's tayshaun all over again. solid but that's it
TheJTram::He has crazy athleticism, can finish, and plays great D along with range. He's an upgrade if given the minutes...
jakegibbs19::Won't get a chance, Porter will be gone by pick 3
TheJTram::We NEED him...wth?
Philip3664::why?
BillyJoelsSecondWifeFan::102-99 03.8 sec to play
Justinkm83::If he makes it foul Det
TheJTram::The fact that we actually had a chance to win: Brian Hill&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lawerence Frank
jakegibbs19::Charlie V. is 28 years old, and is shooting the ball well tonight.
