log jamming::bucks fans should be eternally grateful they are not in the western conference
Jhe1125::memphis is essentially directly south of milwaukee, and they are in the west
milwaukeemonster::we're on the eastern side of the map..why do we have to worry about being in the western conference?
clipctb::Ellis has got to learn how to use his quickness to get to the rim better.  That way when his outside shot his is off he can get a few layups and get going!  Also if he gets to the rim better he can break the defense down for his teammates.  Go to the rim with your left hand Ellis!
milwaukeemonster::lol win games we supposed to lose..and lose games we supposed to win...digusting
WeAreMarquette123::wish we'd just tank lose em all and get a high DP
MEMPHIS GRIZZZ::HELL YEAH GO GRIZZZ
taurus1984::Grizz we gotta play better come Monday......we need to play smarter and harder..go grizz #gritgrind
balltillifall_88::glad the grizz pulled out the win tonight. they get into their slump when they lost that double overtime game to the lakers in memphis, and im hoping the win against the lakers in LA has pulled them out of it. still need a better effort than the past 2 games though. but the good news is z-bo seems to be coming around and getting back to form. i think its more of a mental thing right now for him than physical.  oh yea, does anybody have any idea when dante cunningham will be back? hes done some great things all season and especially these last couple of weeks. we could REALLY use him against OKC.
Kev_010::Bucks sucks lol. Brandon Jennings going to leave Milwaukee so have fun with Ellis.
Goon-::Mayo and Gayo...
MEMPHIS GRIZZZ::TROLLS
imichalak2310::How is it possible to win the rebounding battle by 19, shoot a higher percentage from the field, and only win by 4?
mr.jreed21::fouls, and backup point guards not controlling the game
ChiTownSound::Jimmer playin well tonight...5 pts in 7 min
rc021363::I don't care which one, Oh St. or Kansas winning tonight, but the winner, I am hoping will beat Kentucky.
ChiTownSound::Will Jimmer be a factor this season?
Edwyer76::Under.  Woooooo!
nu life::Thank God for 30 plus 2nd &amp; 3rd quarters. Oh yeah, and O J Mayo.
ChiTownSound::Do the Kings fans here think Jimmer can take over the point?
royboy1978::Aight fellow Grizz fans see you Monday night when the Grizz face OKC.  I won't be watching the NCAA game since college hoops ended for me two weeks ago.
mr.jreed21::yes we will need the win bad so hopefully they play that way. Conley got his rest tonight bc westbrook will be coming at him like a train
David535221::YES GO GRIZZ.!!!!! KNICKS BACK UP 2.5 AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!
mackmilitary::i want the old monte back
remotecon1::bahaha good luck with Jennings can't wait until he's traded
mr.jreed21::thats where a point should help. if jennings quits trying to be the leading scorer, his game will come naturally
_Buckster_::Me to. He has been way to passive with the Bucks. I think he is just trying to fit in without ruining the chemistry.
rc021363::Bucks, hang in there, you are so close to making the playoffs.
buckspackers23::I'm surprised that K.G and Pierce haven't had their hip-replacement surgeries yet.
_Buckster_::KG epitomizes the mindless morons that populate Boston.
tom bradyforpresident::who's 4th seed and who isnt even 8th? thats right kg and pp.
buckspackers23::K.G is so black, that God thought he burned him.
USMC3121::Mayo save the Grizz tonite they still won't make the playoffs with they way they been playing!
rc021363::That is my concern right now.  The Grizz has so much talent, but so inconsistent and keep making bad moves.
rc021363::I love OJ Mayo when he is hot, but he needs to be a lot more consistent.  Well, that is like the rest of the team lately.
Hatchkelso808::Bucks have a really good team but Ellis has to play better than 1 for 12.
BostonHurl::braun is the joke of the world and milwaukee also
MamaThereGoesThatManN.Y.::Wow Memphis sucks
mr.jreed21::....but we have a better record than NY in a tougher division.
royboy1978::So does the Knicks!!!!!!
BostonHurl::milwaukee $@%!$@ and $@%!
nbafanatic69::sad, bucks.  just sad.
BostonHurl::all fans shoulod kills thems selves also
mackmilitary::This is why i'm a bulls fan first
ChiTownSound::Touche
jjohnsob723::how did the grizz look tonight?
mr.jreed21::Thanks for coming out to the #timetogrind show. I hope this was enjoyable for you BUCKS fans
BostonHurl::bucks all shoul kill themselves
_Buckster_::Is "shoul" a Boston term?
chillin8ball::counting da bills
rc021363::Hey Bucks, nice close game!  Go Grizz!
_Buckster_::You too.
ChiTownSound::Big win for the Knicks....
BostonHurl::milwaukee full of niggs and loosers
Chuloflow::Thank u Grizz..  -Knicks fan

Benjamayne::call it grit n grind
royboy1978::A win's a win.  I'll take it however we can get it.
Freshd34::jennings tried to draw a foul on a three. lol. smart. good game by both teams
BostonHurl::worst team ever
Larke30864::YES! Thanks, Grizz!
_Buckster_::Good game Grizz fans.
rc021363::Let me guess, the Grizz are going to foul a three pts line.
nbafanatic69::ah man...  thanks , bucks!  buncha losers.
royboy1978::PHEW!!!!!!!!!!!
ChiTownSound::OJ Dagger!
BostonHurl::Milwaukee stand zero chance they blow balls
buckspackers23::You are obsessed with "blowing  balls"
_Buckster_::Must be a Boston thing. Along with being illiterate.
stonetackle83::damnit grizz many teams are counting on you
wilber22dexter::why
royboy1978::These FT's are critical Juice!!!!!!
rc021363::This is the Grizzlies of late, can't win and can't make good decisions in the close ones.
