Joe Smith::I can't believe the Magic coach is just getting a free pass these past few years.  If he is coaching for a high draft choice, I guess he is doing well.  I seem to remember Doc Rivers taking an average Magic squad and winning back in the day.  I'm  not convinced this guy will be an elite coach.
clint::Orlando's offense was on the Lamb tonight.
Anton::McGee?
DON::Magic's best 2 players not on the court.  A lot of talent, but it's not with the coaching staff.
Dawood::Nikola Vucevic, when he would return?
PKM::Set the tone for the Broncos.
Chair::go nugs!!!
fup duck::If the Colts can score 45 pts, they have a slight chance to win a game.  No defense doesn't win championships
- LJ::lmfao oladipo is a joke... the beast bennett will be this seasons top rookie!!!
brett::Scrubs vs Scrubs... Scrubs win Fun fact: More people will watch the MIND BENDING THUMB BENDING video on Youtube tonight than will watch this game. Word.
