Arfacmad::man I'm loving  Ramon Sessions in LA! Playoff push much?
esfahany::Turn overs are killing us....if we just cut down TO's by 4 or 5 per game, it would give the team enormous result by end of the game,,,,,now w/descent PG maybe ,maybe Kobe wont handle the ball as much ..........Get those rebounds big guys, get those rebounds.....
socal_G::all the lakers need is a solid and consistent small forward, along with a couple impact bench players and they will def be dominant. im excited to see what theyll do in the off season... on another note, im excited by what ramon is bringing to the table already #lakersordie
Talentsojhin::I could see them going after Gerald Wallace. He would fit in well there.
bballshawn24::we need world peace defense on lebron, and we need another bench presence
Kobe62pts_Mavs61pts::Hey guys. Oj mayo just tripped Blake griffin and oj got a flagrant 1 lol.
i liked this comment::good to see Sessions fitting in so well in LA........as a Cavs fan I will be rooting for the Lakers if they happen to meet up with Miami in the FINALS, Lebron will never get the points record with one team as he is bound to become a RINGCHASER when Miami fails again in the finals..........hehehehe
sidthemagnificent::Lebron James needs to go back to Cleveland,and team up with the team that Gilbert is building,one first pick ar a time!The Lakers will win the next two NBA titles,with the present team! I would like the cavs. to win a few titles,with Lebron and the Lakers'picks,after the Lakers'next two titles!!!!
Trojino::If Kobe and Pau shoot just 40%, the Lakers win by 15, now that is scary, Kobe and Pau played one of the worst games of their year and the we still won handily
diditravel::RAMON SESIONS FIRST START!!! dude can ball!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9xvIH247fk
diditravel::RAMON SESIONS FIRST START!!! dude can ball!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9xvIH247fk
Kennyprager::Is it me or when watching Sessions last night against Raymond Felton.....the Lakers made the right choice at PG???
Trojino::Absolutely, Felton is overweight, bottom line
Kennyprager::Long time Lakers fan: I think the sky is the limit for Sessions....Like Andrew Bynum who is 24....Sessions at 25 is still very young...but both of them have been in the league long enough where they can really start to be ELITE players as opposed to rookies starting out and taking a few years to develop. What this means is that Kobe does not have to wait for the development anymore of the two most important positions on the team: Center and PG...which fares well for the team going forward if they are to compete for a championship. I still think they are a few tweaks (mainly SF and a few bench shooters) away from not only being a contender but a favorite!!!! The future looks bright....and the team is a lot younger now with the subtractions recently made and the additions of Sessions and Hill.
Trojino::lets hope Buss keeps Sessions but because he is so young, and we only gave up a draft pick (and debt)  this was a great "draft pick"
Kennyprager::True!!!!
Trojino::i hope not, he could be top 10 in the NBA in terms of PG
diditravel::RAMON SESIONS FIRST START!!! dude can ball!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9xvIH247fk
Kennyprager::Sessions is not going anywhere!!!!
Kennyprager::Jordan Hill may develop into quite a nice surprise for the Lakers if they decide to keep him and play him next year.....
Trojino::He could be in the running for 6th man of the year if he plays next season
bowss::he should
Kennyprager::He sure could fill in for both Bynum and Gasol ahead of McRoberts and Murphy!
Kennyprager::I believe if the Lakers are to pull the upset and win a championship THIS year....Pau Gasol will have to play out of his mind with stats like what he posted when he first arrived. Pau Gasol in my book is the wild card!!!!
Kennyprager::I loved the STARTERS balance last night against Portland...Everyone in double figures points wise. The minutes were distributed wonderfully....although the bench (with the exception of Barnes) did not score much, the bench minutes were not that high....the starter had the bulk.....but not excessive. Last night was a perfect distribution of minutes by the coach!!!! Although, I still believe we NEED Goudelock to get some minutes...he has the potential to be a Jason Terry/Jamal Crawford type of player
Lord Of Da Bulls::Bynum gonna get injured before the seasons over and miss the playoffs... just saying
sidthemagnificent::I hope you ger injured,as Bynum is done with injuries!!!Now is the turn of Da bulls to get injured
paypaypa::lord of $@%!$@%! stop haten on bynum he,s done with injuries now hes a allstar hater
Kennyprager::Can we FLAG Lord of Da Bullshiat!!!!?????  just for saying stupid comments?
morgan122240::Not this year pal!!!
jorgewr84::Another Laker Hater.
Court-Jester-James::The bulls will have the best record and nothing to show for it, just saying choking is in their dna... And MJ is but a memory seems decades ago! lmfao, But dont trip cookie chip, we'll put the heat and court jester james where they belong in the back seat, as we hoist number 17 and kobe ties MJ with 6 rings and about 5 yrs to try and get #7. Its good to be a Laker fan we expect nothing less then a ring always, and hate from the haters AMEN!!
Jmahh::and the bulls are going to get beat by the heat again just saying
Randis38::You ever notice how Bynum is in the key no less than 6 seconds each trip down yet the reffs don't call it?..Check the tape.
morgan122240::I meant Players,just in case you want to use my spelling against me like most Laker haters!!
Kennyprager::morgan...next time just click the edit button...I always do that to correct my spelling....Randis just wants to point out BORING things..
morgan122240::Yeah and if you paid attention other to palyers on other teams,you'll notice the same thing.....HATER!!!
Jmahh::i dont get it, sessions didnt have cancer, make a wish foundation really came through for him lol, now if only staples center can evict the as usual underachieving clippers, i mean it is embarrassing to be a clipper, i think lebron is destined to be a clipper, they just wont ever win a championship
Court-Jester-James::lmao king james not even one ring, more like court jester james!! The kings fool. You can always broadcast next to sir Charles, and for ever be humble for entering a great league with that disrespect of name u have. You fool nobody but yourself and a league thats as gullible as a 4yr old. court jester james  4life.com now thats a website for that $@%  &gt;:^0~
Jmahh::haha
scante31::He can follow in the footsteps of players like him in the past such as Ron Harper and Dominique Wilkins. I think you're on to something there.
FTLakerFan::Lakers are a new team with Sessions, I cant remember the last time LA had a quick point guard who could manage the game, other than the days of Magic, and with the emergence of Bynum and not having to trade Pau the Lakers are in good shape for the playoffs.  Their biggest problem now is the bench, but the bench gets much shorter during the playoffs so that will not be as important.
Kennyprager::Jordan Farmar was very quick....just not a high basketball IQ
Kennyprager::I thought Sedale Threatt was very quick and a solid player!!!
morgan122240::They had them,but not with this kind of line-up and playoff potential type team.As mentioned above,Van Axel,and oh yeah they did have a small guard that played with the championship team for a couple championships.I think his name was Tyrone Lou or Rou or something like that,but he was off the bench,but very effective
FearNo_Fish::The Lakers had a pretty good PG in Nick Van Exel, but he liked to go to Cancun instead of showing up for the playoffs....
sidthemagnificent::LakersNation:good news!! Lakers,this present NBA season:The big four Lakers,next NBA season             :The big five
Trojino::Getting Gerald Wallace will  be a Championship caliber move
xmanfolife::No doubt, Sessions is the real deal......gonna b hard for teams to get used to playing the Laker's &amp; having to worry about the point guard for a change.  Now teams gotta worry about the point &amp; the bigs....not to mention Kobe.  Bad news all around for anybody n the west...
morgan122240::I certainly agree with that and they only played five games together.I am so glad that the Chris Paul deal failed and that Howard deal fell thru the cracks.The only thing i would have love to see Is Lamar Odom back with this team.I wonder if his woman had something to do with doing what he did,you know"They don't appreciate you Lamar,You should ask for a trade" kind of thing.Foolish pride can really play tricks on you,and make you regret as time goes on,hindsight is a muther.
Kennyprager::Don't be surprised to see the Lakers bring back Odom next year for the minimum...The good thing is the worse he plays the easier it will be to sign him and for cheap!!!
Jmahh::i just watched this awesome video on ramon check it out its good stuff  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74tH77L8uAo
DeezBrown::Half way through and I love it already!
DeezBrown::Lakers have the best starting guard combo in the league
sidthemagnificent::I have being saying this,since the trade happened!It took Brown too long to open his eyes!
Jmahh::lakers only real concern is the thunder, even tho they have yet to play the spurs this season, i like the lakers size, and sessions is what puts the lakers above the spurs in my opinion as well as the ability to compete with the thunder, la just better win some road games in the wcf, and fortunately for the lakers, they will get either a 2 or 3 seed and not have to face okc until the third round but a lot can happen, as for the heat fans, shut up, you guys havent won anything, yes lebron is great, but micheal jordan is not the best player ever with out 6 rings, no one cares about regular seasons, kobe should have had at least one more possibly two MVP's, but other then the +5 five rings, since you weigh this symbolic importance on mvp's, Kobe has 2 championship MVP's, how many does lebron have???
RingCity_LA::Stop hating On Kobe U Guys Are Laughing Now Come Playoff Time When He Dominates everyone Not Like Lebron haha You Heat Fans Wont Be Laughing Youll Be Crying And Praising Kobe.
takemehomelord::Kobe greatness lakers of all time that puts him 2nd behind MJ but if u ask me kobe way better than MJ hands down and mvp can suck my dogs d..I..c..k..
Lilwillaf24::I agree Kobe is the greatest. Statistics don't mean sh.t just ask king James
CBass1317::Kobe is worse then MJ in every single statistical category.  He is great, but I am just saying ...
takemehomelord::@MVP dude I feel so sorry for u I bet u are some fat a..s..s.. loser with no life, no friends, no girl friend. I come to this conclusion because how can u just sit behind some computer for the past 3-4 hours posting all your hater talk bout kobe but that's not the point I'm trying to make I'm making this point your life sucks a..s..s.. and bloging on the cumputer all day is the only thing that gets u off and makes your day complete lmao.
FearNo_Fish::The Lakers did what they had to do in getting Sessions, but it was a sad day when Fisher was traded. I have nothing but respect for him, wish him well, and will still root for him (unless he is playing the Lakers of course). He is a class act in this age of basketball inflated egos, buffoonery and fake tough guys.
Surfcoat::Derek Who?
jcmaggi::Seriously. He was on 5 title teams hitting countless clutch shots. The man deserves the respect he's earned
FearNo_Fish::That would be "Fisher". The man is/was clutch and a winner. Show some respect.
I will try to be nice::what happened to Portland
Randis38::Pretty simple when you let Bynum in the key 6 seconds every play and let him just slam into anyone and get no fouls called ..They Blazer had no chance when the reffs let him get away with that $@%!.
FearNo_Fish::Portland played well last night. There were making a lot of 3s in the 4th qtr to keep it tight...
BakoCowboys::Once the rotation is down/Kobe can depend on Sessions I think things will run a lot smoother. Right now I think Brown is resting the main guys for the playoffs. Brown screwed up Bynum and kobe I think as far as pulling them and having them sit on the bench to long.
Jmahh::gotta love self proclaimed KING status with no rings to show for it, LeBRONZE and Wade couldnt manage a gold medal with out riding kobe's D**k, i wonder if lebron asks wade to wear is championship ring, prob arouses him ;) he think ohh ohh kobe x5 thank you kobe for a gold medal
BakoCowboys::As far as the whole Lebron thing goes there were a bunch of haters on here $@%!$@%! about kobe taking to many shots last night Lebron had pretty much the same night. Wade didn't play well either. They aren't learning a new offense and with Brown switching the rotations up so much its screwing things up. I hope Brown knows what he is doing because this team is a championship team.
hatenorv::lebron had 4 assists though, and 5/17&lt;6/15
StillPrettyFlyForAWhiteGuyOC::Gasol is bad in traffic and is almost automatic from mid range.  I think its a good strategy
FearNo_Fish::Anyone else notice that Gasol is putting up a lot of 20 footers instead of working the block?
boom.shaka.::He and Bynum were alternating early in the season but it wasn't working for either.  Now Bynum is the dedicated low-post presence and Gasol is more of a floater.  His points and assists are up since the move but rebounds are down.
jcmaggi::That's cause he's working the high post with Bynum on the low block
FearNo_Fish::OK, but the high post really isn't 20 feet out. He just seems to be taking a lot of jumpers lately (good thing he is making them)
jcmaggi::The most encouraging thing about last night? 33 assists on 40 field goals
jcmaggi::Two more titles and one more olympic gold medal for Kobe before it's all said and done
boom.shaka.::I'd rather see him sit out the Olympics and rest.  Gotta be ready for title runs in 2013 and 2014.
DeezBrown::He wont do that... its too much like right
MVP3_Lebron James::Even Kobe knows the titles are behind him.
Ewms32::LeBronz Mvp?...You Mean MCP...C as in Crying!!!....The Only Rings He will ever get is the 1 on his shirt collar&amp; the 1 in his hot/cold TUB!!!....LeBronzBac2Cleveland.....Crying all the way!!!!
CBass1317::Two players?  How about Kobe, Pau, Bynum, and Artest?  Looks like at least four to me, and probably the important four.
StillPrettyFlyForAWhiteGuyOC::Very true  Only two players remain from that 2010 championship team. Also, Kobe in his 16th season still leading the league in scoring is extremely impressive  I was listening to Jim Buss on ESPN710 radio in LA and sounded pretty confident on how things are going. In reality the guy isn't as bad as the media makes him look like As a huge Laker fan its a sigh of relief because he's taking over the Lakers soon
jcmaggi::Lakers have been a dealing with constant change this season. New coach, new system, new players, no practice time to learn and adapt to all of the above and yet, they're still at the top of the league with teams that have been together for a few years now and have their coach. Lakers are looking good for a title.
MVP3_Lebron_James::And we all know "WHO" is behind me...
MVP3_Lebron James::It doesn't take much to push Laker fans over the edge.  Cheer up.
boom.shaka.::meh....when you have a lot of fans you're bound to attract a few nuts.   I put him on "ignore"

MVP3_Lebron James::Cool Bio!
MVP3_Lebron_James::And a Cool Story! Follow me on twitter @ iownlakernation There, i post CRAZY A-SS STORIES OF MY HOMOSEXUAL EXPERIENCES!!!!!!
MVP3_Lebron James::How do you shoot 42% fg and call yourself a "shooting guard"?  So sad to watch.
nba is the worst::What else would he be - he shoots a lot.  That's why he leads the league in scoring for Mike Brown - just like lebr0n in Cle
MVP3_Lebron James::Ok...................you got me. Kobe is every bit as good as Bob Cousy
boom.shaka.::John Havlichek, Pete Maravich, Elgin Baylor.....just sayin is all.
MVP3_Lebron James::Russell.................56% fg
hatenorv::i think u mean 56% ft percentage
boom.shaka.::http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html
boom.shaka.::...and Bill Russell - you forgot him too.
MVP3_Lebron_James::And i'm every bit as gay as lebrick.
MVP3_Lebron_James::IM GAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!
boom.shaka.::Shoot them.  Shoot them both.  Regards, That Weird German Dude From Raiders of the Lost Ark
MVP3_Lebron_James::DONT SHOOT ME! IM JUST A G-AY A-SS LEBRICK JAMES FANGIRL!!!!!!!
MVP3_Lebron James::We know!
MVP3_Lebron_James::YES!!!!!!!
MVP3_Lebron James::How did I know that
MVP3_Lebron_James::BECAUSE IM GAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!
MVP3_Lebron James::No player is in the hall of fame under 47% fg without averaging 8 assisit per game. Kobe will be the first. There will be a new section............."The Volume Room"
boom.shaka.::Bob Cousy and Bill Russell would beg to differ....
MVP3_Lebron_James::And in that "Volume Room" , volumes of gay $@% dou-ches will f-uck MY $@%!!!!!!!!!!!
Michael081201::where's a neighborhood watchman when you need one.Zimmermen please put this guy out of our misery.
boom.shaka.::Kobe is so selfish that he's averaging 3 fewer shots per game since the Lakers got a functional PG.
Michael081201::Trouble is he jackin up too many 3s and not shootin in the flow of the game too many times.
MVP3_Lebron_James::LEBRON JAMES IS THE BEST!!!!!! HE IS THE BEST!!!!! I LOVE HIS DICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
