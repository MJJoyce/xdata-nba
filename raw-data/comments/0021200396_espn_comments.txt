BEastChamps2013::Bobcats coach is an idiot. How do you NOT put in Ben Gordon, a prolific scorer, in AT ALL when you are getting blown out and cant score?  Last 2 games, you decide to DNPCD Gordon and you've been blown out. You're an idiot. Gordon is not the problem, you have sucky big men. Thats your problem. Put in Gordon, Sessions and Walker together.... keep the Dookie losers as the bench.
Talentsojhin::Gordon has been out with some personal crap.
jayeteee::GG, Nuggets. Maybe now that Karl sees some of the bench players can play, he'll get 'em into the rotation more when the regs aren't producing. Pretty simple really, but GK is a bit of a hard head.
swagg3hunna::Should the panthers draft a WR or a defense of player in the draft?
swagg3hunna::Should the bobcats go for a  scoring big man or a sg in the draft?
polomontana::With Derrick Williams you would have a dynamic, young starting 5.  Walker Taylor MKG Williams   And if you could get a Cody Zeller in the draft, the Cats would have a young starting 5 with people like Gordon and Sessions to back them up.
Budd1087::We would have to trade a decent player in return. Unfortunately we don't after those guys you just mentioned.
King DM::Maya &lt;3
TheJTram::In all seriousness, good night
