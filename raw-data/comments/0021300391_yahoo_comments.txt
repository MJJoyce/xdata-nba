bluuzman::Impressive win by the Lakers, Minnesota has been playing well. Very impressed with the team's play in 4th quarters this year. Props to Pay and Xavier for stepping up and Swaggy P as well. Good job.
clint::the Lakers still look sloppy, however, they look like they are having "fun". entertaining to watch.
Alvordton::Several lesson here.   1) At this point in his career, Kobe needs to evaluate his role and how he integrates himself with the rest of this team with he returns 2) There is a lot more talent in this league than some would admit. Some languishes on benches or pigeon-holed on the floor When allowed what players do on the floor matters more than than what is on paper 3) No matter who the team is you better come ready to play, especially on the road 4) Despite all that was said above the Lakers still have issues that will not be easily solved
