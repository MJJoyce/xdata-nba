Eric62748::It's ok Wolves you can still make the playoffs!!! LMFAO You guys were talking the big talk ALL year lonnng and your team sucks... Kevin Love for MVP LOLOLOLOLOL
skybridmatt::almost our whole team is injured you hole. we'll go next year easily.
OOHnirav::I don't care if every starter and your coach is injured, your team just lost to the New Orleans Hornets. There's no excuse for that, you just have to hang your head in shame for certain things. I believe the Wolves will probably make the playoffs next season, but it definitely won't be "easily". Western conference is tough, and there's no telling how much tougher it'll be when Deron Williams and Howard make their moves.
yeahgodisgood::I found a betting system recently called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I found this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it.Thought I would post this for anyone that is looking for a betting system that actually works

dlhouse18::using it now if you're still here. R2 didn't work
dlhouse18::thanks later.
Jeter El Captain::I also don't like jeter anymore
dogs::Jeter the Captain. Hmm...
dogs::lol try the espn email thing
Jeter El Captain::I couldn't think of anything else lol
arsenal1470::Congrats Wolves ...
k_nak::Everytime I look at the box score of MN games, it always strikes me as odd that Wesley Johnson keeps starting.  At this point in time, it seems like it would be clear that he just doesn't have the game for the NBA.  Shouldn't Williams be getting that PT even at the 3 spot to see what he has or to develop?  Either that or Beasley needs to be starting.  Kills me that Love doesn't have some decent players around him after all this time.  I know Rubio got hurt but there's been plenty of time to put at least a consistent 2 and 3 in the starting lineup.
arsenal1470::he was a better coach in Houston ...
k_nak::Adelman, I've always thought, was one of the better coaches in the league.
dogs::Man our coaching sucks. They think Wes can get better but he doesnt!
Jeter El Captain::Judging by that question dogs does Minnesota hate Mauer now?
dlhouse18::Imagine what Burnett was like for you. Except Mauer isn't that bad.
dlhouse18::At least we don't have him. Mauer is actually a decent human being.
Jeter El Captain::they're both douche bags
Jeter El Captain::don't bring that douche bag up T_T
dogs::A rod makes 33 million right now
dogs::I never liked him. And now we are wasting 25 million on him even though he can't hit..
dogs::He is a good hitter and all but that's all he can do is hit for average. It pisses me off he is getting paid 20 million
Jeter El Captain::Haha why did you never like him
dlhouse18::We're just critical of him. I like him, but he frustrates me.
dlhouse18::stupid eggs keep rolling off the table GAH! Good thing Easter candy only comes around once a year.
dogs::The best part is after Easter when everything is on sale
Jeter El Captain::Those reese eggs are awesome though
dlhouse18::yep me too.
dogs::yea I noticed that in OZ
dlhouse18::yeah they are. I did have a few cups though too. The good ones are the ones that don't have the packaging tucked in. They are a little bigger.
Jeter El Captain::ik they're better than the cups
dogs::Yea I ate like 10 of those today
dlhouse18::Oh hell yeah! I had like 4 today. More PB less choc is awesome,
Jeter El Captain::Wow that's shocking the Orioles looking like the class of the AL
Jeter El Captain::How important were Kubel and that one other dude?
dogs::Cuddyer were super important. Would you guys like to have Mauer from us?
dlhouse18::Jake Arrieta had a helluva day on Friday.
dogs::The Twins made him look like he did.
dogs::The Twins are making them look good.
dlhouse18::Round 2 in progress.
dlhouse18::Have to eat a lot of butterfinger eggs to keep me up this late.
dlhouse18::Oh. Go anywhere?
dogs::Spring break for me was last week.
dlhouse18::I am not too bad myself. I've been getting like 14 hours of sleep with spring break.
dogs::Man I am going off pure energy I gotta walk up early tomorrow though.
dogs::Ding Ding
Jeter El Captain::ive been banned so many times dogs lol ive been around since like 03 i think
Jeter El Captain::Wow thanks so how do the twins look so far?
dogs::Haha look at the score of their game.
dogs::Lol what was your main account?
dogs::ESPNreinstatement@mzinga.com
Jeter El Captain::Iswallowjeter94 embarrassing ik
FormulaOner::Where are the freaks that usually frequent Timberwolves boards at this time of night?
dlhouse18::Full moon out tonight
dogs::We are Wolves so we are out at this time
Jeter El Captain::dogs how have you kept that account so long shit
dogs::I became friends with Espn so I can get unbanned easily
dogs::is that your account or did you get banned?
Jeter El Captain::wow this sucks

dlhouse18::should i try this one dogs? nm no name tag
dogs::go ahead
karelp::Rubio might have been the Wolves' MVP...they're 4-11 since he got hurt.
dlhouse18::Didn't get approved.
dogs::Did you get notification?
dlhouse18::yeah
dogs::Dl, Espn is super slow at night time so expect it to be up by morning
dlhouse18::k hopefully. Getting anxious.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Good night Minnesota and Happy Easter.
dlhouse18::Happy Easter
dogs::you tooo!
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Hey Minnesota, last question I ask before I go. Would you trade Kevin Love for Andy V, and a 1st round draft pick this year and a 2nd rounder? and we'll throw in Casspri too.
AIadvocate::SYKE?!?!
AIadvocate::ANDY V?!?!?!  Van SLYKE?
dlhouse18::No. You never give up a top 5 NBA player. Esp. the best player at that position!
Eric62748::ummm he isn't top 5 at HIS position . 5 players i would take in a 7 game series over Love... Griffin, Pau, Duncan, KG...and Millsap tends to beat the crap out of Love every single game they play against eachother.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::ok. lol Just Curious. I just love K.Love's game. How long is Rubio out for?
dogs::he will be back by next season Hopefully healthy.......
dogs::I hate taking chances with draft picks every year soo nah....
dlhouse18::Been 10 minutes ESPN wake up and approve me!
dogs::check your notifications
dlhouse18::none yet.
dlhouse18::Do we have Hendricks pitching next game? He's the only pitcher I look forward to watching.
dogs::13 minutes till Easter
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::it's Easter here. :)
dogs::Lepe you still here?
ksizzle08::Note says Eric Gordon left in first quarter, did he return?
dogs::Idk I was watching the Twins lose.
dlhouse18::He left for MN. Early offseason.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::For laughs:  http://loscy.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/lebron-bricks.jpg?w=600
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::I think all the cav's fans and I agree on that we know its going to take a solid 3 years till we are back into playoff contention. We only have 4 good players and 3 of them are hurt. so... :/
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::also TT has about 4 double-doubles.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Remember hes only a rookie!
dlhouse18::I agree with Varejao. He's an above average PF, but Thompson I don't.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::Anderson Varaejo and Tristian Thompson.
dlhouse18::Kyrie is great, but I am not really sure that Jamison is a good piece for the future. Who are the other two?
dlhouse18::Still bitter huh? jk that's pretty funny.
dogs::lol thats good animation
dlhouse18::@dogs waiting for approval. I cropped it so that it looks sort looks like how yours is posed.
dogs::alright
dogs::@Dl This wouldn't work http://www.google.com/imgres?q=alexi+casilla+jersey&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=fGFe52yM0zqcMM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.customcheapjersey.com/minnesota-twins-jerseys-c-35_108.html&amp;docid=hlrpEEVAEgw5BM&amp;imgurl=http://www.customcheapjersey.com/images/12_Alexi_Casilla.jpg&amp;w=500&amp;h=500&amp;ei=7xOBT8GQKISBgwfWxemHCA&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=101&amp;vpy=146&amp;dur=379&amp;hovh=130&amp;hovw=130&amp;tx=70&amp;ty=97&amp;sig=117589273097522999464&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=130&amp;tbnw=130&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=17&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:69&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=639
dlhouse18::How do you know if it works? did you check?
dogs::Yes, but I am pretty sure that will work.. if it doesn't you will get a notification.
dlhouse18::So it may take multiple attempts?
dogs::I submitted a photo of Morneau's jersey like this a lot and none of them worked until this one.
