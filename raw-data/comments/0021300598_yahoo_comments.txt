Richard::Shabazz Muhammad continues to be an embarrassment, as those of us who watched him at UCLA last year knew he would be.
ALL::7-8-7-5-6-6 .  Ricky Rubio's point total from the last 6. Last 3 games he is 2-6 from the field in each. Even against the Jazz, he can not break out of his abject mediocrity. I don't expect 20, but maybe a 5-6 for 12 points? Is that too much?
this1guy::Why did Corbin end up playing Rush 27 minutes in this game when the younger players need to develop?
Todd::I knew the Wolves wouldn't improve much when they fired Kahn only to hire Saunders.  I think the only reason he traded Burke for two blacks is because he was afraid people would say "Look at the Wolves... drafting another white player."  The only problem with that fear is that, in this case, the white player would have provided so much more value than Muhammad and Deng.
MarkN::Again, most of the points coming from 3 guys.  Kev., Kev., and Pec.
Austin::this is just sad, the only explanation for 23 points at half, is that the jazz are terrible!!!!!!!
Dan::Well it is hockey day in Minnesota today but I was at Target Center tonight. The Jazz are awful.  WOLVES!
NedP::twolves: 0-12 in games decide by 5 or less.
PKM::I think the Jazz have a chance.
Devin H::The Jazz without Hayward  are the worst team in the NBA and one of the worst teams in the last 5 yrs
