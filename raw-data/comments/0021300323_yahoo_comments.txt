Cyril::Just some interesting stats:  When Brandon Jennings has 10 or more assists, the Pistons are 4-3.  When he scores 20 or more points, they are 2-6.  When he shoots 20 or more times in a game, they are 1-5.    In the last four games, he has 75 shot attempts and only 22 assists (with 19 turnovers).  Those 75 shot attempts only netted him 97 points.   Sorry, I know Jennings has had a few games where he actually passed more than he shot, but for the most part he is still the same old Brandon Jennings - taking a bunch of shots and still only shooting 40% from the field.  He has shown that he has the talent to be better, but he's got to get the mentality of a playmaker for the Pistons to truly be successful.
64993366::Good teams win close games. Well, I am not sure we can call Pelicans a good team as yet, but certainly West teams on average are much better than East teams.
KMike::Pistons can't stand prosperity. Can't close out games late. When they learn to do that, they'll be a team to take more seriously. Right now, that's not the case. All you can say is that they're competitive, and more entertaining. Better than the recent past, but not good enough to put any longer run together.
PKM::2 completely opposite teams.
PKM::I can't explain it but the Pelicans seem to be playing even better without Davis.
Cam Knewton::Josh Smith is gonna attempt 400 3's this year and make 40 of em. Love ya, J-Smoove, thanks 4 nothin
Gyper Bait::13 points in the 4th quarter ! What's with that, Monty Williams' personnel choices ? Maybe kept Austin Rivers in there a bit too long.
MICHAEL::4 players on the Pistons are playing better the Josh Smith???
Stephen::I thought Evans was hurt?
J::Free-throws.
