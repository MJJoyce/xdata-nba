CamGoingHAM::Since the All-Star break the Cavs are the NBA's worse team
sa330206::For sure.. this is hopefully our last year of tanking for draft picks.  Next season theres no excuses.
CandySparker::I like Brand on Jennings.
Hierosonik7::Good job Bucks. Now for my hometown Cavs... uhm... Well...
_slickSixtySix_::.
college hill cincinnati::Dang.. they got they @$$ kicced.
JohnsonnnL::Cavs need a quality center and a 2 guard. Hopefully Beal and possible Fab Melo.
WashFlokie::win by enough points here? jeez
jjensen1192::dan gilbert even admits the cavs suck. cavs fans can no longer talk any s,hit
poodagg::they will believe whatever their puppet master tells them!
spong3bobrox::Thank God it's only a 66 game season.   -Kyrie Irving
Swimbikeron::Dan Gilbert will be in the lottery again, he's right Cavs deserve better than him
sa330206::Shut up.. I like Dan G!
fearthevest10::Only one more month of this left, and then its lottery time!
Giggity.iggity::Jamison.. 4 shots in 30 minutes of play. And only 1-4 at that..  Only stat I needed to see.  Having said that.. I don't think this team will win another game this year.
Bill Hater::Kyrie's on drugs!!!!!!!!!!!  He's taking drugs to enhance his performance!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What a cheater!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
opethbrewcrew::What a route by the deer
i know more than you sir::At least Kyrie, Tristan, and Gee didn't give up. The rest of the team was so pathetic.
3rdCoastTexan::cavs suck
travismiller411::Ive been following a betting system called sportsbettingstar for a couple of months. Since joining I have made over 3K a month on average by just following this system. Thought I would post this for anyone that is looking for a betting system that actually works
rockndoc2::SACTOWN WINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  #6 and counting!
hoffdogg202::I was hoping that even with a shortened season the Cavs could win more games than last year.  It was looking good for awhile.  Now I'm not so sure.
KingGeorge53::Think Ping Pong Balls!
zachzach2020::More losing = more ping pong balls = more losing = more ping pong balls .................
KingGeorge53::btw,   Go Cavaliers!
falseprophet2012::Nice Bucks, keep it up so you can knock the Knicks out of the playoffs.
ChiefWahoo1995::NO doubt the Cavaliers are looking really bad right now.  check this out - http://www.lakecounty-sentinel.com/index.php?p=51_44_LakeCounty-Sentinel.com-Bucks-bomb-Cavaliers-121-84-03-30-2012

cland4ever::dildos
Gt_jackets89::bit<b></b>ches
DyersEve06::Just me and the trolls now.  Guess I'm out too.
Tyler45818::You are the most annoying person I've ever dealt with on a board. Bye bye, see ya the next time the bucks play the Cavs.
CLEVELANDCBI::I'm out too all, gotta lay the kids down.  Mr. Mojo, when you have sex with a woman you can have a kid.  GO CAVS.
DyersEve06::Later
CLEVELANDCBI::c ya
CLEVELANDCBI::Mr. Mojorising, You come into a room just to be a d.i.c.k.?   Seriously, make a friend.  You're 13 to 23, definitely single with no hope of seeing a $@%!$@ soon.  We understand, but you do need help.
Gt_jackets89::Haha true, but *13-17
DyersEve06::Hehe..."13-23, definitely single".  Yeah I'd say that's accurate for just about every internet troll out there.
Mr. Mojorising::I hope Cleveland keeps Byron Scott and Colt McCoy. Its gives the rest of the nation something to laugh at. Not to mention the Indians.
DyersEve06::I hope they keep Byron also.  Colt is on his way out, though.
CLEVELANDCBI::I hope your mom takes away your Internet privelages soon.  Now come back with a more clever mommy joke.
rockndoc2::I'm out guys................................  Everyone root for SacTown and NJ tonight!   Cavs could move up towards #6 by morning!
CLEVELANDCBI::Goodnight man.
DyersEve06::Adios.  Go Sacto
Mr. Mojorising::I love watching Clevelanders get mad. Its great.
Mr. Mojorising::The rest of the US is laughing at Cleveland.
CLEVELANDCBI::You "is?"
DyersEve06::The rest of the US is enjoying friday night.  If you had friends, you would be too.
DyersEve06::That's a sign of a pathetic, empty life.
CLEVELANDCBI::We're laughing at you fool.
DyersEve06::How can you live with yourself after spending most of a friday night trolling internet forums?  It doesn't get much more pathetic than that.
CLEVELANDCBI::Mr. $@%!$@%, Come on, you've got some more clever stuff to say....................  You can do it...............
Mr. Mojorising::When Bernie Kosar and Mark Price are your hero's...you know your city sucks.
DyersEve06::Here is a free grammar lesson for our resident troll.  The word is "heroes" (plural) not "hero's".  You don't need the apostrophe, but you'll learn that next year in high school.
CLEVELANDCBI::Knew you could do it.  You're so awesome and original man.
Kobe_in_my_team::Maaaaan!     LOCK OF THE DAY     Milwaukee -5,    thank you Cleveland for being so crap  LOL   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Mr. Mojorising::I dont know who is a bigger joke...Mike Holmgren or Byron Scott.
CLEVELANDCBI::Holmgren's got the cool Walrus nickname.  Gotta go with Scott.
rockndoc2::Mrs. MojoSinking...........you need to find a life before it is over........take up online chess or something
Mr. Mojorising::Cleveland=the mistake on the lake. Fitting.
CLEVELANDCBI::WHOA....... you're so clever.  And so lonely.  Make a friend.
DyersEve06::Ever been there?
Mr. Mojorising::Byron Scott=the worst coach in the NBA and its not even close.
CLEVELANDCBI::Scott clearly isn't getting everything Bill Walton has to offer.
DyersEve06::We're all hurt personally by that insult.
CLEVELANDCBI::With all those healthy veteran All Stars the Cavs should be undefeated.  I'm with ya dude.
Gt_jackets89::A good night, Bucks won, Knicks lost, and Hawks won.
DyersEve06::Question for Cavs fans...let's say we could trade Varejao alone for the #2 pick.  Would you do it?  I would have to consider it.
CLEVELANDCBI::LOVE the guy, took a Ray Allen cheapshot to the Verajao's and kept going; but that high gotta be sensible.
DyersEve06::Kinda surprised.  I figured I'd get a bunch of HELL NO U DONT KNOW BASKETBALL!!111!!111ANDY4LIFE1111
rockndoc2::No one will do that tho.....#2 is TOO much upside......will be Kidd G
CLEVELANDCBI::I love the guy but yeah, for that I'd do it.  Less money for a guy a decade younger.  Anything outside top 10 I'd keep him though.
CLEVELANDCBI::I'd give Andy and every other pick but our first, and throw in Walton to sweeten the deal.
rockndoc2::I would trade Andy and the 25 for #2....................
rockndoc2::DONE   ..........not happening tho
DyersEve06::Chris Grant has done a heck of a job as GM (especially compared to the b00bs in Berea) but he should have demanded both of the Lakers' picks.  Eyenga has promise and Walton is useless....should have gotten more in that deal.
rockndoc2::He basically bought the #25 for 10 mill.  thank Dan Gilbert and the future losers at the HORSESHOE
CLEVELANDCBI::I was praying Minnesota would do a desperate move once Rubio went down; no luck though.
rockndoc2::I was hoping for:   Sessions Jamison and a 2nd........for Walton, blake, 2 firsts
DyersEve06::Don't get me wrong, I was pushing for them to trade Sessions.  Just wish they could have squeezed LA for more.   I love the ability to swap Miami's 2013 pick for LA's...should be valuable.
CLEVELANDCBI::Said the same thing a month ago.  We got something at least but 2 would have been sweet.
DyersEve06::The other pick (from Dallas) was top-20 protected and they ended up wasting it on Jordan Hill.  Oh well.
rockndoc2::Right now, the core IMO is :  Irving........?  ?............?  Gee.....Casspi  TT.....Samuels  ?.........Andy  Work it to draft Beal, Leonard, McCollum and three ? get filled
rockndoc2::To me, Andy is like Z.    Keep him a Cav for life.  his work ethic is unparalleled, and the wrist was a freak thing.
CLEVELANDCBI::Agreed unless the perfect deal came along.  Love that goofy $@%!$@%.
CLEVELANDCBI::TT has made some strides.  I still see good things for him.  Gee's impressed too.  Love Andy, but would trade him for the right pick in a second.  His health scares me (as it does every Cavs fan I'm sure)
DyersEve06::If Andy hadn't missed so many games these past 2 seasons, he'd be untouchable.  But his health and style worry me.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::I think we can get quality players in the first 3 picks we have. I like: 1a. Thomas Robinson PF 1b. Terrence Ross SG 2a. Draymond Green PF. 2b. dude from Vanderbilt as Center.
rockndoc2::I think they should do everything they can to get Beal.  He would fit perfectly with Kyrie and Gee
CLEVELANDCBI::I just don't want any guys that look 35 or have receding hairlines.
DyersEve06::Is that a knock on Eyenga, Lebron, or both?
CLEVELANDCBI::Oden too.  I saw him play several HS games in person.  My niece thought he was the coach as a sophomore.
dabears9900::Anyone know when the Cavs will get their 1st round pick from the Kings in the Casspi trade?
DyersEve06::Cavs will have 9 picks in the next 2 drafts if Sacto makes the playoffs next year.
rockndoc2::In 2015 it becomes a second rounder if they dont make the playoffs
CLEVELANDCBI::2045 at this point.
DyersEve06::Yeah, 2nd rounder like RnD just said.
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::I thought it was protected untill 2017 then they get the pick automatically.
DyersEve06::Whenever the Kings make the playoffs.  Hopefully next year.
DyersEve06::Lot of talent on that team.  They just need to figure it out.
dabears9900::We're never getting that pick then
CLEVELANDCBI::How many of us would like Gibson less if he didn't have such an awesome name?  I might not recognize him with a nickname of "Bob."
DyersEve06::I don't understand why Cavs fans like him at all.  He hasn't had a good game that mattered since 2007.
CLEVELANDCBI::It's fun to yell "I love B00bie."  Was more fun when my ex yelled it.
rockndoc2::Here is one other thing Byron Scott should do.   Put Gee at the 2 and Casspi at the 3.    See if Gee can play 2, which I think he can with some work.   that way, if the pick ends up being Barnes, they both can play together.  With the second rounders, use them to move up the Laker pick and grab the best center
DyersEve06::Probably not a popular opinion, but I'd like to see them trade up from the Lakers pick and get Rivers.
rockndoc2::B00bies!
CLEVELANDCBI::b.o.o.b.i.e.
CLEVELANDCBI::Little Rivers would be a more frail $@%!$@.  We need a firm $@%!$@.
rockndoc2::I could live with that.   Depends on what they do with their first pick.  Imagine if they traded up and ended up with Beal and Leonard.!!
Thurmonaaaterrr41::Barnes is highly overrated...
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::he should fall to 20-25
rockndoc2::Agreed, he should fall to 7-10 slot.
CLEVELANDCBI::I'm still holding out for Charlotte taking Walton straight up for their pick.
CLEVELANDCBI::I'd definitely try a package deal. 4 guys 25-40th or whatever isn't as promising as another lottery, not like that'll happen though.
DyersEve06::With Jordan making the decisions....
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::oh no not Barnes..
DyersEve06::Thunder are the best team in the West, right?  They have a core of three top-5 picks.  Takes some painful losing to build a winner in a small market.
rockndoc2::mm
rockndoc2::moved it
DyersEve06::Hey, I was reading that.
rockndoc2::OK City was SO LUCKY....they did most of their losing in Seattle.......How sweet is that?
DyersEve06::That's true..but if Thompson pans out then 2/3 of our core is in place already.  Add a couple draft picks and then we'll have something.
DwightSchrute23::You better believe drastic changes are coming for the cavs organization, Kyrie will follow lebrons footsteps if in 2 years this is how we are playing. You don't lose by 40 to the Bucks, they are good and all but no NBA team should lose by 40. I'm hoping we can maybe trade our 2 first round picks for a top 3 spot and get Micheal-Kidd Gilchrist to give us an athletic scoring machine at the wing. We need to draft a solid center as well
dabears9900::I'd rather have Beal, a better SG to play over Parker (who I hope retires). Put Gee at 3, and bench Casspi
DwightSchrute23::They are projecting us to get beal so you might get your wish
Thurmonaaaterrr41::Either way the Cavs will get a good draft pick since this is a very deep draft. What you think about Jeremy Lamb?
DwightSchrute23::He would be a great addition, he's just a lesser version of MKG. Great shooter and can penetrate the lane and pass. All around good player
BuckeyeheadKyle_828::I'd rather have Thomas Robinson.
DwightSchrute23::Yea he's solid
DyersEve06::Here's the thing, though.  Keep losing and we can draft MKG without trading up.
DwightSchrute23::That would be great and then we can use That second pick To get a solid player down in the post
i liked this comment::blah blah balh
