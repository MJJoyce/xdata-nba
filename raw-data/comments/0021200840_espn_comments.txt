rkini1::If the hawks move up to the 4 seed and no one reports on it, did it really happen?
BlackChick1987::Atlanta is a very unselfish team. They pass the ball well. 2nd in assists behind the Spurs. Turnovers are not high. Good frontline, solid D most of the time. The Hawks are interesting, but when are they gonna take that next step(Conference Finals, Finals)?
4SportsFanESPN::If Anyone outside of Atlanta put up the numbers Horford did last night and in this 5 game stretch, ESPN would be all over it. Such a "superstar" advertised game and not enough team advertisements
Drivebyfalcon::We have three of the most underrated players in the game with smith, horford, and teague. You add in a healthy lou williams and sign a free agent superstar in the off season and wow we could be a force. Very good bench / role players too. I know we will have another early exit this year but we really are a fun team to watch.
88bryant18::Giving Lakers benefit of the doubt - they could go 15-9 over last 24 games.  Schedule is pretty soft.  If you give them some home wins over teams that are clearly better than they are (Atlanta, Memphis)  - that is about what they COULD do.  That would mae them 43-39 - on the bubble.  Then they get swept anyway in round 1 by Spurs or Thunder.
riprope27::Gonna predict that Houston signs D12 this summer. Josh smith to Rockets in a sign and trade for t-rob(or t jones) and Asik. Rockets get a line-up of D12, Smoove,Parsons, Harden and Lin= contender. Hawks get their 5 in Asik and a great piece in T-rob moving forward. I'll take Asik, Horford and teague going forward for us.
Devinhuelsmann::thats the al horford that used to be a dominant big man if he keeps up those numbers (unlikely) than he could potentially be an all-star next year. i can see him in the all star game.
C-Jammin::He's always been a good big man when he is healthy.  Obviously he isn't going to put up 20-20 every night.  But 15 and 10 is well within his reach.
riprope27::15 10 is nothing for him. Get him a real 5 and he'll be a perennial all-star
91Gmoney9009::Going on the road and winning is difficult. But going on the road and winning by double digits, thats impressive. Hawks are playing well since the break, maybe it will make Josh want to stay if we can make a deep run in the playoffs!
AtlHyd::Let's go Hawks!  Great win, Al Horford manned up tonight, he hit a 3 pointer at the end, lol.  That's when you know you've had a good day.  Outside shooting is so important for this team's success.
DBlock044::Good win Hawks I am proud of you. Lets take 2 out of next 3 on the road and we will be set for home court.
King.Awesome::Caulderon sucks.
GodofAcid::A lot of people are going to owe the Pistons an apology when they turn this ship around before the end of the season. A loooot of people. Need more alcohol now.
Thunder4Life2008::So not trying to be a dick or anything.... But was the stadium really as empty as it looked on ESPN?
maize_n_blue1981::golly GEE!!! the pistons lost, gosh dangit!! I'll be darned!
Sam_Cassells_Spaceship::One of the worst drafts in a long time and the Pistons are going to have a mid first round pick.  I look forward to seeing Joe Dumars make a bad situation even worse.
Lemuel7043::Looking at our schedule, they won't get that much rest. It's a tough schedule ahead.
iownamicrowave::Any steve winwood fans out there tonight?
Dave Knows Best::The Hawks are the least publicised good team in NBA history. I gotta say.
fastfalconvick7::Go freaking Hawks.
DTownSportsLions::Dammit Pistons
atlphillip::no way 12,000 people were there
4SportsFanESPN::How about them Hawks?
4SportsFanESPN::Great start to the road trip. If Horford keeps this up we can be in the fight for home court advantage down the stretch of the season
liquidvizions707::yes. way. you all cant play with melo and stoudamire. dunno why yall just dont trade the the latter
NYKfan870::No way
Ryan8791::Any reason Knight didn't play or did I miss something?
King.Awesome::Because he sucks and isn't an NBA caliber player?
mattcowboys77AD::knee injury. day to day.
200175716::O if the hawks play at this level in the playoffs, we could hve a ring!
4SportsFanESPN::well to be fair, this was the Pistons
hussein623::this will be the standings in the eastern conf. at the end of the season:  1. Miami Heat 2. Indiana Pacers 3. Atlanta Hawks 4. New York Knicks 5. Brooklyn Nets 6. Chicago Bulls 7. Boston Celtics 8. Milwaukee Bucks
hussein623::man u pistons fans are the worst. Everytime yall lose(all 37 times), yall start making racist and childish comments. face it yall SUCK.    P.S. stop liking your comments
ploking95::you r wrong about the 8th seed, raptors r going to take it, and r u iraqi??
hussein623::Lemuel7043 - He has your location now. Id evacuate now if I were you  were you being sarcastic?
Lemuel7043::He has your location now. Id evacuate now if I were you
Lemuel7043::Remember when Boston was on our tail? Look at the gap now lol
liquidvizions707::yep. and i bet the jazz gets em tonight to push them a full 4 games back of us
LetsGoBraves2012::hawks just need to get a 2 or 3 seed.  bypass miami until the ecf.
liquidvizions707::no doubt. let miami and the celtics duke it out. i think we can take any of them other teams right off the bat.
Lemuel7043::I think we can beat NY as long as Melo isn't "that" hot again when we meet them.
gigolo555::Watch out Knicks and Pacers here them birds come.
liquidvizions707::yep and pacers got the warriors and clippers next. while the knicks gotta deal with the warriors and the wizards in wash. i can see wash. getting that game. we just need stay on a roll!
mattcowboys77AD::I will just smack 'em birds and run away like the bit.ch i am  -Melo
Lemuel7043::LOL. Like what he did to Hawes
Lemuel7043::I think Lakers are gonna get destroyed against Nuggets. These team just keeps on running, Lakers age wont be able to catch up
liquidvizions707::same here. nuggets done won both quarters. if the insane kobe dont show up again in the 4th then that win streak ends tonight for the lakers.
ATL_____UptonUptonAndHeyward_____ATL::itsover2222 835 posts after 4 quarters, the lakers nuggets game gets 5000 halfway thru the 1st quarter _______ Who cares when 90% of these comments actually are decent, and most comments on laker /heat/etc. boards are complete spam nonsense
hussein623::imagine what the hawks would be doing with lou will
hussein623::tore his ACL. Where have you been?
t casey::What happened to him?
hussein623::we would be the 2nd seed with him
liquidvizions707::i know man. totally blows losing him all season
Lemuel7043::You know, with all the people saying bad things about Detroit, it's the complete opposite of what the fans show here. Just noticed
Hi There_::These people have no clue what Southeastern Michigan is really like. Every game it is just uneducated kids coming on here spewing hate.
mattcowboys77AD::if only calderon did not fall asleep tonight and the pistons as a whole tried on D....
boltonator11::We can handle Brooklyn, but I miss JJ...
Lemuel7043::yeah those smooth jumpers and sick handles
liquidvizions707::but yeh i miss him
liquidvizions707::i dont miss his massive contract. and i personally like harris more.
mattcowboys77AD::harris will personally come to your house to thank you haha he gets no love.

Lemuel7043::Who wants to go troll Lakers board? lol
LeBron is my Grandson -Greg Oden::a lot of spammers there :/
