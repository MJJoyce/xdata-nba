george::Brandon Jennings! Does he lead the league in turnovers?? Scrub..
Bball247::Alright, who will get more assists: Rubio or Jennings?  Steals?  Should be a very fun point guard matchup to watch
Patrick::Way to show up Pistons....never even in the game.
PKM::Detroit has to be the worst free throw shooting team in the league.
El Jefe MN::If Minny is going to make a realistic bid for the playoffs this season it has to start tonight.  Schedule to date has been a beast but, looking at the upcoming games, they could realistically go 16-5 over the next 21 games.  Wins:  Det; Philly (2); Mem; Bos; Lakers; Wash; Mil; Dal; NO; Pho; Char; Sac; Tor; Utah (2).  Losses:  SA (2); Port; OKC; Clips.  I don't see it as being THAT unrealistic, but they gotta get going....especially the bench.
smokey::Josh Smith, 1-5 from three. He's going to set some sort of record for most three attempts while making less than 30%.
roe::Detroit lets go!
Dan::Solid win by the Wolves but how bad is the East? Wow.  WOLVES!
southlarena::Rasheed is an asst coach, Hamilton and Ben Wallace are out of the league, but Billups is still playing.  Wow!
Commenter::Deetoilet's BB team is as bad as its hockey team.
