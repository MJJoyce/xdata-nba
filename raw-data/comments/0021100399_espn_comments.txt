MPerce4::Good game for the Thunder. the Jazz put all their focus on Durant, so Westbrook took what they gave to him.  I'd like to see some better ball control and passing in the future, but I'm not too concerned. This game came on the tail end of a hard fought road trip, and you could tell the entire team was a little out of sync.
Da-THUN-Da::Westbrook is not a traditional PG. That is not what he does or tries to be. He is avg 22 pts a game and the thunder have the best record in the West. Now does he need to turn some of those TO into assists OR points   YESSS! Take care of the ball a little better at times. Every single player in the NBA can be broke down and improve their game in some way. Im just saying hes not perfect but im tired of hearing everytime they lose "Westbrook worst PG in the league 30 pts, 3 assists,  5 TO thats why they lost" There are way more nights when he has those numbers and win than lose.
rjs0287::P.S. - i cant tell you how annoying it is to have some d-bag commentator scream into the microphone to the point where i have to run to turn down the volume on my system in order to not wake disturb my neighbors.. please try to keep your volume one the same level.  Thanks
rjs0287::ESPN needs to clean up their commentary. While Ibaka did put down the slam espn made it look like James Harden put it down (confusing). .  I think you need some new commentators that don't yell into the microphone/make inaccurate comments.
Da-THUN-Da::i liked my own comment. But i do like it.
gianluchisti::MANIPULATIVE MATCH : toronto - boston     because BOSTON want arrive #7   and must pay $$$$$$$ for GARNETT PIERCE ALLEN ...     IN PLAYOFF one lost 4-1 or 4-2 vs MIAMI or CHICAGO is GOOD....   respect 4-0 vs PHILADELPHIA 76rs !!!     (my favourite team are SPURS , NUGGETS and SIENA ... i don't have cause for speak the false ...)   ( i live in ITALY - TUSCANY - SIENA - PALIO of SIENA )
mcshumway::Guard Westbrook and make him be a passer.  But Durant is a terrible matchup for the Jazz.  The Jazz bigs are more natural low post players.   Kirilenko's contract was awful, and he was diminished by the end, but he was in the mold of the type of forward you need these days.  They don't need Jefferson, Millsap, Favors AND Kanter.  And the guard play, particularly Harris, has been underwhelming.  A little advice:  look for guards that can shoot the 3.   Hope they can make good use of the trade exception, or all the picks they have next year.  Too bad there won't be good point guards in this draft.
AndySportsB::THUNDERup!!! Westbrook is doing well lately
The_Ref_You_Love_To_Blame::You play to win the game, I don't care if Westbrook takes every shot! If you win the game s.t.f.u about what Westbrook doing. 21-6 go get a wet wipe!
joshuaizme::These "Westbrook haters," aren't just hating on the guy because doesn't average 10 APG. It is more than that. He is shooting great right now, HOWEVER, his lack of sharing the ball is taking away from Durants' developement. There is a guy in Golden State that can put up 40 on any given night who is also an undersized 2 guard named Monta Ellis. He can only score though. Now Westbrook is way better already, but if he wants to become the type of undersized 2 guard, Wade is, he NEEDS TO PASS THE BALL. Not every drive, but he needs to get his teamates involved, CREATE shots for them by attacking the lane. He is a threat on offense, so actually UTILIZE that and you will find guys wide open as you draw in defenders. Durants' ceiling right now in terms of his potential is plummeting because of Westbrook. Westbrook isn't a true PG, so what? Wade isn't either, but Wade gets his teamates involved, not as much anymore becuase of LeBron being the primary handler, but look before that time. Come playoff time, this team will get crushed by the truly good defenses due to it's lack of flow on offense.  OKC fans, would you rather have Westbrook fully reach his potential or Durant reach his max potential? Because in my opinion, the only way they both can reach their max potential is if Westbrook learns when it is the right time to share the ball.  People attack Rose for shooting a lot, but there is a difference, HE DOESN"T HAVE DURANT. Or even Harden. He has to. It is his job to control the offense, and the rest of the teams job to play strong defense. And Rose gets his teamates involved, they just aren't great shooters or playmakers on offense and that is why he does't average 10 APG. But he has improved in his court vision this year.   Westbrook will never be anything more than a Superstar version of Monta Ellis, or a poor mans' Wade (which isn't a bad thing), unless his decision making and court vision improves. It isn't that we are "Hating," on Westbrook, we can simply see what you OKC fans can't see with our outside perspective.
Frank38443::Hey Utah fans.. still think you're going to make the playoffs? Rofl.
dontmuchcareatthispoint::The Jazz could be drastically under .500, and there would still be some folks around here in SLC who'd think they'll make the playoffs. Fans will always be fans.
dumbNBAfans1::In the last 10 games, Westbrook is averaging 26.1 ppg on 49% shooting, 5 rpg, 6.1 apg, 1 block per game, and 2.3 steals per game. In other words, he's putting up numbers that destroy Rose's 2011 MVP season in every category except assists, which he is getting only 1.6 less of per game than MVP Rose.
slugger457::I give Westbrook an "A" for courage and fearlessness. I give him a "C" for brains...so does that make him the smartest player in the league?
dumbNBAfans1::Lin is smartest. He gets an "A" for Harvard genius.  But your point stands. The NBA, and seemingly anything associated with it, from the headquarters all the way down to the fans, are all dumb.
NextOne021::ooooooo shiiiiiiit hmmm some one is thinking for once now but keep on hating it just means he is doing something right
slugger457::Karl Malone needs to give it up. He is never going to win a championship. Just retire!
dumbNBAfans1::KeMvP277 Yeah, if he can consistently put up 50% shooting then i'll call him a reasonable ballhog. Like Kobe. 19 Minutes Ago  @ this fool. Westbrook is currently already closer to 50% shooting than Kobe ever was in his life. Kobe is a top, top player in NBA history, so I'm not trying to diss him, just stating facts because you don't know how to pull up statistics.  Kobe also shoots 25 times a game. Westbrook can score like a mug. He deserves his 18 shots that he's taking. Not every player is content to average 12 shots a game just because they're playing with a scoring champ/dude who likes to score (Gasol, Pippen, LeBron in some games, like Finals??)
Space Bulls.::Once again Thunder get help of the refs to win this one.  Man with all that star treatment the Jazz didn't have a chance.
RollThunder35::Space Bulls is a sad,sad version of life.
esstea23::Even if the Thunder win the championship, people like this jibrohni will say the refs won it for them.... We can't seem to win even when we win.
NextOne021::hahahah your a foolish one jazz suck get it through that thick head of yours
kbballin_5::Did you watch the game?  The Jazz fouled a lot.  They werent bad calls either.
Rare Character::Dude, the Jazz never had a chance in the first place
gerald_5::harden=best bench player in basketball westbrook need to pass the ball
hapatino::Harden is not good enough to even start in his team.
dumbNBAfans1::I love Harden too. You can love Harden without crying about Westbrook needing to pass the ball.
slugger457::That guy in the 4th row eats too much
kbballin_5::Yeah.  Hopefully Reggie Jackson can develop.  Maynor was such a solid backup at PG.  He'll be missed in playoff time.    Also, Thabo is under-appreciated.  They need him back to fix the rotation.  They could have used him in this challenging road trip.  9 of 11 on the road.
gerald_5::i guess you are right, its not an easy transition...
dumbNBAfans1::Exactly, or Maynor used to do it when he was healthy.
kbballin_5::They make up for it by having Harden play starter mins. off the bench and rotating between them 2 running the point.
dumbNBAfans1::He's not a PG. He never was, and has been made into one after coming into the NBA. If this continues to be an issue, for fans and coaching staff, move him over to the 2. He's a damn good passer for an SG. And can score with any SG in the league as it's becoming more and more obvious.
gerald_5::im not hating on westbrook, great player, but for a PG he shoots to much, thats all im saying
kbballin_5::Westbrook needs to keep doing what he's doing.  Harden is the new Ginobili.  Its not always pretty but its affective.
kbballin_5::Their playoff struggles last year came in the 4th quarter and it was more the just Westbrook.  Dallas had an extra gear and OKC's youth showed up  Hopefully they learned from that expirence.  We'll see come playoff time.
gerald_5::i know what westbrook is doin is working right now, but playoffs are a whole diff story... still a great player
LeBrons Illegitimate Hairline::<b>Jeremy Lin is the best point guard to ever play.</b>
slugger457::...today in New York City...for the Knicks. Othawize...he a punk
dumbNBAfans1::If you take out the fluky 0-13 game that Westbrook had this season, he's shooting 49%. No other guard in the NBA is averaging 23 ppg on 48% shooting, 49% without that horrific game. Bottomline, Thunder $@%!$@% and NBA $@%!$@% all around need to appreciate what he is. He's on track statistically to some day possibly become Wade / Kobe -lite. Not as good as them, and probably never will be anywhere close. But the next best thing after them.
Rare Character::Westbrook is going to be hell of a player.
Rare Character::I agree, the IQ of Jason Kidd and his skills, it's going to be a nightmare for defenders.
kbballin_5::He already is, and he's only 23.  Wait for his basketball IQ to catch up with his athleticism.
kbballin_5::You stop trying to use your numbers and/or logic on the haters.... How dare you!

badguy40::same question i was asking myself y is westbrook taking more shots then durant?
kbballin_5::because he gets open more, and creates more shots for himself.  Also he creates a lot of turnovers/fast breaks.
KeMvP277::westbrook thinks he's the best. KD is a much better scorer than him, but Russ is just a ballhog. Reminds me of Austin Rivers.
