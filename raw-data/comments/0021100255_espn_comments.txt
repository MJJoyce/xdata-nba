4thQuar7er::Interesting fact,   Bargnani is number one in the league in terms of Defending PPP.  He is ahead of Gortat, Howard, etc.
yaq87::suns done officially
NBA_refs_are_weak::I love Nash even more when he said he wanted to finish his career in PHX because of his loyalty to the team and fans, but let the man go at least contend in the playoffs for the last couple years of his career
Chris4JR::BARGNANI &gt; GORTAT  "Gortat is an elite player" -Suns fans, bwahahahahahha
NBA_refs_are_weak::first of all, neither is an "elite" player. and bargnani had a great offensive game, he does it alot. but gortat also had 21-12 so its not like he was a no show. 2 completely different type Centers, really just a matter of what kind of team and roster you have
arizonasportsman::Bargnani was well rested for the game, Gortat wasn't.
JOE CARLS::LOTTERY HERE WE COME!!!! GO SUNS DRAFT A WINNER!! Not another LOPEZ
Hutch1005::Steve Nash needs out of Arizona. It's just not right him wasting away there.
CandySparker::Big Bargnani Sale now!
bernotas22@yahoo.com::vote ron paul for president
bernotas22@yahoo.com::bargnani haters where you at???
Dichio2313::Can't play defense? Guess you haven't checked those defensive stats this year huh
RavensCC::one good game. He still cant rebound, play defense, not an elite offesive option, and you cant build a team around him
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Why would you even as if you should vote for Obama?  H E L L N O!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Raptorsfan080::thanks for the win ;)
Caan2184::lets c if andrea shows up vs jazz
Caan2184::after 14 straight loses to the suns, life is now perfect, pass the spliff, puff puff
NoChorus12::So, that's 5 wins.  Already 1/4 of our total wins last year.  Yay?
Alex Kroll5482::Nash can stay if he wants to its his decision so everybody get off his nerves and stop saying he should be traded. I would hate to get told what to do if I had a career in sports and so would all of you guys.
Alex Kroll5482::Suns are one of most elite teams with great players I love the suns and they will make 7th or 8th seed
JOE CARLS::man u are just crazy!!! this team of ours SUCKS this year and there is no way we are coming anywhere close to playoffs!
Alex Kroll5482::Sorry guys I just love the suns and I know they suck too I just hope they get the 8th seed I miss watching Steve Nash and the Phoenix suns in the playoffs otherwise I just root against the heat which is fun too. I want something to talk about.
Caan2184::hopefully u get lucky like da bulls with rose, and draft anthony davis
Orange602::Do you really want the Suns to get the 8th seed, get swept in the first round, and end up with a non-lottery pick in a deep draft?
Caan2184::they lost to the raptors, are u kidding me????
Orange602::ummm
Malcyon1::What the **** kind of Center is on the outside shooting threes???
The Great Sabu::You mean Channing Fry?  Andrea is a PF
Caan2184::italian stallion andrea
Caan2184::hey suns fans, welcome to the 2012 lottery draft.................
Alex Kroll5482::Dude you never know what could happen suns are my favorite team and I think they make the 8th seed this season
Colin Cowherd is awesome::dude keep up the positive attitude man. I agree
Alex Kroll5482::They're gonna get the 8th seed you watch the suns wil finish strong with 38-28 record
Caan2184::no chance, going to the lottery
Caan2184::anthony davis kentucky, steve nash, what a deadly combo, lob city
NoChorus12::They can keep us Raptors fans company
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::for sure
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::I miss the Micheal Finley (a younger version) he was beast.
BoomShakaLuka::Robert Sarver is a bozo. He has no clue how to run a basketball team. The Suns were two wins away from a 2010 Finals appearance, and he decided to gut that team. Nash doesn't deserve this anymore and should demand a trade.
DropBuckets00::He's needs to finish his carerr as a sun!!!
Caan2184::he is gone to new york next year, time 2 rebuild suns fans
Plargo::Grant Hill is THIRTY NINE YEARS OLD for chrissakes
NoChorus12::I didn't even know he was still playing until today
Orange602::Clearly the future of the franchise
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::Arizonaasting001. I too, have college ball experience and I know the game fairly well.  I cannot for the life of me think why Frye is out there.
Orange602::I feel like they extended Frye just so they could have the "feel good story" of a guy playing for his hometown team.
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::Wait. He is from UofA.....grrrrrrrhhhh!! sorry arizonasting001..just kiddin.  Fry would go anywhere else and bust it for 15-20 per game. Just watch when we finally trade him.
arizonasting001::Yeah I played some college ball as well. And Frye shouldn't even be on our team.. we signed him to what a 5yr. extension a couple years ago? Just embarrasing
BoomShakaLuka::Suns should have passed on Frye. He shot 1-21 from downtown (games 1, and 2) against the Lakers in the 2010 playoffs, and played no defense.   The Suns front office is clueless. They don't want to pay Amare, yet forked over $80 million dollars to scrubs. Childress is making nearly 7 million a year the next 3 seasons and he's riding the pine.  People need to chant... "Sarver Sucks!" or "Sell the Suns!" at home games from now on. Give this guy a message that he's crumbling a once proud franchise.
Anthony111714::Are you guys going to vote for Obama this year? This will be my first election  to vote and I'm not sure what to do??
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::Mitt Romney is the best choice
Colin Cowherd is awesome::Colin Cowherd
bernotas22@yahoo.com::ron paul
TunaSauce16::Romney's a lobbyist with no self integrity. Ron Paul is the man we need in office.
SanDiegoSuperCharges::ron paul!
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::He is ok also
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::Mitt or Newt. Are you fu ken kidden me? Screw that State of the Union.Watch porn instead
NoChorus12::Wait, we won a game?  Us? The Craptors?
arizonasting001::doesnt count, you beat Nash, Gortat and a bunch of D-Leaguers.
NoChorus12::Figures. Welp, Craptors gonna Crap.
arizonasting001::People should stop blaming Gentry. None of this is his fault, he is a decent coach. Just look at the talent he has to work with, it's all Sarver and the ownership's fault.
Orange602::Honestly, Gentry seems like a good guy who relates well with his players. I've just always questioned the way he manages their minutes. Why hasn't Markieff Morris been playing more? Why is Frye still getting consistent minutes?
arizonasting001::yeah I agree. Morris needs more time but other than that I feel like he's done OK overall managing minutes. He isn't a great coach by any means, but if he had more talent he could get them back in the playoffs no doubt.
Orange602::What are you talking about? Suns' management gave him Turkoglu, Childress, AND Warrick. What coach can't win with players like that?
arizonasting001::god dammit orange haha.
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::good point. Gentry is a good guy. I have a change of heart. Somebody must go down for this horrible showcase of what you call nba.
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::I am tempted in remaining a suns fan. I have been one for 35 yrs
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::Fu c this. Go Sun Devils. Go Dbacks and Go Cardinals
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::Every X sun has great game=Barbosa.  ok, goodnight.
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::Raptors?? Raptors?? OK, I said goodnight.
arizonasting001::I feel the same way. Hang in there.. every team has its ups and downs, we'll be back soon (once Sarver is gone)
Orange602::The only players on the current Suns' roster that I see having an impact on the future are Gortat and Morris, everyone else could go (even Nash)
Orange602::Yep, I just don't think that the current ownership is willing to deal him.
arizonasting001::We need to get a first rounder for Nash. This incoming draft class is stacked.
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::night fellow suns fans....we are deflated for sure. No more spark in us. We need drastic measures.
steviebizzle::Tom Chambers just called the Suns a terrible team on live tv
SanDiegoSuperCharges::well they did just lose to the frickin raptors at home
arizonasting001::speaking the truth
Colin Cowherd is awesome::I think he was talking about the Raptors
steviebizzle::Well at least he can state the obvious.
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::he should say fire Sarver and Gentry
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::Hes a terrible commentator
arizonasting001::Sarver is so right, unless Grant Hill is on our team, NO ONE will go to a single game. He is truely an all star and the future of this team.. lmao
SanDiegoSuperCharges::only gortat and nash are truly quality players hill can play some D but his offense isnt how it was a couple seasons ago
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::By everyone, have a good night
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::later Danimal. I accepted.  fork
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::watching my suns is no longer a priority
steviebizzle::Suns fan forever
Abernier3::watching Arizona sports is painful...
Abernier3::your credibility. and how lame you are.
Colin Cowherd is awesome::what does that have to do with anything?
Abernier3::Your name is f u cking Colin Cowherd is Awesome and you're telling ME about credibility....good lord...
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::sit on it
Colin Cowherd is awesome::dude shut up and quit trolling. do something better with your life
Colin Cowherd is awesome::the Raptors were 4-13 and 2-8 on the road before this game and the Suns manage to lose... wtf
Anthony111714::I just got done watching the Suns game, Thats the Last time I will watch a NBDL game.
Gambling and Rambling::If I was GM I would tommorow Fire Gentry, Cut HIll, Cut Frye, and trade Nash. What are they waiting for those moves have to be made
Orange602::Sarver seems to be under the illusion that Nash and Hill still put fans in the seats, that's why the Suns won't deal them
Gambling and Rambling::Fire and cut everybody this teams needs a new roster and a new direction
steviebizzle::If I could fire Sarver... That would be the best move of them all.
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::agreed.
ZMJ1388::This is sad to watch. Nash deserve so much better than this. His team isn't doing much for him and the organization isn't either. PHX needs to pick things up, majorly.
arizonasting001::We should draft Harrison Barnes or Andre Drummond. Pair them with Gortat, Nash, and a couple max guys we sign, then we are in buisness.
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::Good call.
Abernier3::you need to re-build....
Orange602::Too bad Kevin Love is apparently not an option anymore
steviebizzle::D-Will!
feeldabern::channing frye is garbage
SanDiegoSuperCharges::frye has been garbage's garbage this season
Gambling and Rambling::Yea he is shooting 38% from the field and he is a Center. How is he in the league matter of fact how is most of the Suns roster in the league
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::Yep
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::####################### DIAMONDBACKS 2012-13 WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS#######################
FoRk_GoRiLLa_ReDbiRd_DbAcK::Yea !!
Orange602::As long as they bring back Sean Burroughs
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::LMAO!!
Colin Cowherd is awesome::I feel like you guys arent mad enough... the suns are playing like crap this season.. the best offensive team the last 6 years is averaging less than 95 ppg. im pissed. we lose to too many mediocre teams.. I mean the Raptors are horrible and we cant even beat them at home.
inter2010clchamps::correction. The raptors are horrible without bargnani. With Bargnani their 5-5
feeldabern::all these idiots had to do was hold the ball and rasual butler gives up a pass for a layup.
Gambling and Rambling::I hate this entire Suns roster I dont even know where to begin. You have 40 year old Hill who just over the hill you have Frye who is just the most worthless player in the league. My rant is done forgot you have a coach who is equivalent of ex Colts coach Caldwell
Los suns::Alvin Gentry IS Jim Caldwell.  Nash (Peyton) runs this team, Gentry has absolutely no say or authority.  He's useless
acoster::that's a BS over, can't score any points all game and all of a sudden in the last minute they score 18 points
KingDanimalTheAnimalASUFan28::In other news... D"backs resigned Ziegler
Los suns::Losing consecutive games AT HOME to Cleveland, NJ, and Toronto is inexcusable.  I know we're not the Suns of old but come on....pathetic.  Gentry gotta go, had that cute run 2 years ago but 7 games under .500 since.
feeldabern::how do ya score 15 point in 30 secs. losers!!
HugeGamblerLOL::cash the 2nd half over LOL thanks losers
buster nutt::good enough start, terrible middle and depressing ending.
