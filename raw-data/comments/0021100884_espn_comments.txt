craigawest::THRIVE LAKER NATION!
DenverDiehard35::Lol @ the foul count
BanHammerME::fools dont watch the game
DenverDiehard35::i watched every second
AceVenturaMavsCoach::Good old staples center refs right?? Always kissing the lakers as.s
LakerHaterNumber1::Share a tear with me my fellow Nugget fan.
Raiders-707::Bynums offense and attitude&gt; Dwight Howards offence and attitude
scante31::Looks like the Nugget fans are in hiding today.
UCLASHOTCALLER::Lakers look like they are primed to make a serious run this season! Great inside game with the Andrew Beastyum and the Big Spaniard. Sessions has been solid and even spectacular at timeS. Our prev weak spots, (The 3 spot ie Barns and Ron Ron) have found some confidence and seem to be more than holding their own! Even Blakey playing aggressive off the bench. Throw in Mcroberts and Murphy knowing their roles things look good!  All this with Kobe resting up, wow! Look out OKC!!!!!!!!!
BanHammerME::we should be throwin goudelock out there for at lil bit while kobe is out
The_Pittsburgh_Piper::kobee
giguanarayg::Barnes has been AMAZING lately. Keep it up!!!!
CruzInLA::LAKERS!!!!
FTLakerFan::so still no word on why brown left last night??? something is up.
DidYouSeeThat36::Kobe can play now, but with the team playing well...there is no need to rush him back
mvelt24::yah I don't understand that? No word on Kobe either.
chiefsfan716::Secret boards are for gayy trolls
xmanfolife::Barnes is ballin like a man possessed on both ends...nice to see bcuz it gets catchy.
LakerHaterNumber1::There were a lot of men crying on that secret board last night.   Hope you Laker fans are proud of yourself.
peyton_took_his_job::what secret board?
StompOnFailtics::It's only for GAY trolls.
LakerHaterNumber1::Proud gay Nugget fan here. I usually like to get my $@%! tenderized but I think the Lakers ripped and tore some anal tissue. What do my fellow gay Nugget fans use as ointment to help ease this pain. I've been crying all night after that thrashing.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Shaq's ICy Hot patch?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::So fine hooping ball fellows...how's your well educated cities treating you? - psst, is the mod gone?
To many LeBron trolls::Right now the Lakers would have to go through Houston, Denver or Phoenix first round, San Antonio and OKC most likely. That's doable.
TubbyTime334::Who would Win between Grizz and Bulls?
TheSportsDude2011::The Grizz are a real threat, I have a feeling that Mayo &amp; Arenas can wake up and have a hot hand anytime
LAndofTroyfan2::Tough one, it would be a good game.
LAndofTroyfan2::In a series it would be a 7 game run fo sho!
TubbyTime334::Series?
Sonic_speed1::Grizz
To many LeBron trolls::Grizz
FlawlessVictoryKid20.0::Kobe is the only one who could actually mess this up...more than Brown could. As long as Kobe doesn't ballhog like an idiot..the Lakers could be a threat.
Xpander79::Better than LeBron disappearing in the 4th. Besides a health, rested Kobe will be a much more efficient shooter.
LEBANESEGUY::Kobe haters agreeing with each other..... what a shock!
To many LeBron trolls::Just pointing out the fact that Kobe shoots to much sometimes.
LAndofTroyfan2::Totally agree, he needs to recognize that there are other people on the team that can shoot. Keep the ball moving be more of a facilitator. Quit  all them off balance shots with the shot clock running down, FEED THE BEAST!!!
To many LeBron trolls::Sometimes he forgets he has a team or he thinks he's MJ.
TheSportsDude2011::I have a feeling that the Lakers can win it all this year with or without Kobe
mvelt24::Yah I agree Bynum is the future but they are going to need Kobe to win it all.
TheSportsDude2011::I think the future belongs to Bynum he will make OKC cry year after year
Clippers.Are.Better.Than.Supercuts::TheSportsDude2011 - I think the future belongs to Bynum he will make OKC cry year after year
TheSportsDude2011::Bynum is the future if healthy just get him a good point guard = A Fresh New Dynasty!!!!!!!!!!
TheSportsDude2011::I think Kobe can win 8 rings
TheSportsDude2011::I would like to see Kobe win 7 rings and have the all time scoring record
TheSportsDude2011::I dont think Kobe needs to be superman this year, save that for the next 4 years
TheSportsDude2011::I mean we have Bynum AND freaking Gasol!  TWO Twin Towers,,,If we loose this year, I will blame Kobe, my  favorite player
To many LeBron trolls::Blame brown.
chiefsfan716::NOOOOOOOOOOO!
To many LeBron trolls::If the Lakers are going to win they will need ref help like in 2002.
xmanfolife::Better to have help than no help...
TheSportsDude2011::If Kobe plays, I hope he is not trying to be the MVP.
chiefsfan716::He wont
chiefsfan716::I know right, but still need him
To many LeBron trolls::They will need Kobe.
buzzkill90265::pit passes for "mayhem fest" still available for San Bernadino, if you see a handsom guy chain smoking weed tell him you are a espn poster and I will share
TubbyTime334::I see Lakers 2010 world champions has a Small Sad Following.
chiefsfan716::Need plastic surgery much?
TubbyTime334::No I Like my Avatar of Dirk, Thanks.
Lakers 2010 world champions::See ya haters and laker fans alike. Gotta go now. Been here for 3 hours straight, so like Kobe lets the lakers play without him, I'm leaving you talk without me.  Just remember,  Lakers 2012 world champions
chiefsfan716::peace..
FlawlessVictoryKid20.0::Damn..the Lakers play better when Kobe isn't playing..lol.
chiefsfan716::No, they just let teams off the hook with him not playing. Would've been a bloddbath if he was in there
TheSportsDude2011::I was thinking Tyronne Lue was hurt sitting on the celtics bench for a looooooooong time, so this morning i wikied  it, I found out that he now works for the celtics as a DIRECTOR!  WOW! way to go Lue..glad to see people do stuff like that.
TheSportsDude2011::he did good on Iverson in 2001
TheSportsDude2011::lol
buzzkill90265::you wikied Tyronne Lue, congrats you have the most worthless life on this board
TheSportsDude2011::thanks man!
boom.shaka.::buzzkill90265 - you wikied Tyronne Lue, congrats you have the most worthless life on this board =====  No way, half the fun of the internet is being able to instantaneously look up useless information on a whim.  Don't know how we survived as a species before Al Gore invented it.
Lakers 2010 world champions::You clearly haven't met Heat TubbyTime334 or traded posts with him.
TubbyTime334::Haha I thought that for a little while then realized what happened.
Lakers 2010 world champions::I love how nobody even gives the Heat a chance. Not that they have one.....
mvelt24::If the Heat keep playing like they are, they won't make it to the finals.
To many LeBron trolls::With LeBron and Wade they will always have a chance.
To many LeBron trolls::Yep WWE I mean NBA.
nba is the worst::Due to MASSIVE ref help
To many LeBron trolls::Made it to the finals.
Lakers 2010 world champions::Ummm, NO. Any team with a good frontline will destroy them and the Bulls or Celtics will destroy them anyway.
chiefsfan716::Like last year
buzzkill90265::if you are not hated by fellow fans of your fav team you are not posting right
Lakers 2010 world champions::Kobe can take as much time off as he needs. We have the 3rd seed locked up and he has the scoring title locked up.
TubbyTime334::Nice To See You Get Banned.
TubbyTime334::What did you say?
Lakers 2010 world champions::Yeah, i should have sticked with the mamma jokes.
nba is the worst::Mom jokes aren't considered funny here at ESPN
Lakers 2010 world champions::No, i insulted someone. It was ugly. Even uglier than your face.
TubbyTime334::What happened The Mods know that Sweeping the Mavs is outrageous so they Banned you?
Lakers 2010 world champions::You're back clown?  Anyway, I have 100 backup accounts, so it doesnt matter.
chiefsfan716::U are ugly as fuuuuck
To many LeBron trolls::Clippers are like 1.5 back.
TheSportsDude2011::What? 3rd seed locked up? I dont think so, there are lot of games left
Lakers 2010 world champions::Dude, we are beating the Mavs, Spurs twice and the Warriors and maybe the Kings. I don't think the Clippers can keep up.
boom.shaka.::And the Kings went up 2-0 -- not a bad night for LA sports
mvelt24::I don't watch the NHL but I try to at least keep up with it so I know what i'm talking about
buzzkill90265::to bad the kings chat room is empty I love that LA is going to be Van the whole city is going to riot and LA will not even care to advance in the NHL playoffs
boom.shaka.::It was crazy...they were booing their own team in Game 2 of a playoff series (didn't see Game 1).  Can't remember the last time I saw that.
To many LeBron trolls::Who watches the NHL?
Lakers 2010 world champions::Are Clippers considered to be LA sports?
To many LeBron trolls::Yep Clippers play in staples.
buzzkill90265::I am going outside my house right now and going to find a girl and talk to here, ya right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lakers 2010 world champions::And I'm going bungee jumping..........without a parachute!

nba is the worst::Pee Wee Herman likes this comment
Lakers 2010 world champions::I think you are a butterflies dancing on the wind

Lakers 2010 world champions::Butterflies dance on the wind.
chiefsfan716::Kobe is resting for the playoffs
mvelt24::obviously lol.
nba is the worst::Agree
To many LeBron trolls::Lakers 3-1 without Kobe right?
buzzkill90265::yes you proved that Kobe sucks good for you, no need to ever post again
To many LeBron trolls::Didn't say he sucks.
To many LeBron trolls::And blew out the Spurs without him in San Antonio.
chiefsfan716::right
buzzkill90265::espn needs to be like youtube prove you are over 18 and you are able to enjoy uncensored boards
peyton_took_his_job::youtube is full of kids pretending to be 18  they only talk about arrows to the knees
Bynum Pulls Down 30::would be a bloodbath in here
buzzkill90265::typebath, just words
Bynum Pulls Down 30::So my cordial, fellow hooping ball fans. How's it going this fine morning in your clean well educated cities? - Mod Approved
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Some mod out there loves his mommy
Georgio Auditore da Firenze::or hates the Laker fans prevailing over the haters.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::WHo knew Timmy D was a mod!!!!
buzzkill90265::the mods are pulling you by  the ear and stoping you guys from acting like children
buzzkill90265::go lakers, you guys have fun here today
Georgio Auditore da Firenze:::D
Georgio Auditore da Firenze::LMAO I got a 1 day ban. Thankfully I have like 10 backup accounts.
nba is the worst::Obviously, lack of immaturity isn't a problem for you...
Bynum Pulls Down 30::That takes the fun out of it.
Georgio Auditore da Firenze:::(
Bynum Pulls Down 30::did a mod just delete paragraphs?
Lakers 2009 world champions::Hey nba is the worst,  Did your mother get a refund for failed abortion?
nba is the worst::How many years have you been you held back in junior high?
Lakers 2009 world champions::I'm in university dou.chebag.  But you didn't anser me, did your mother finally get herself a refund for that failed abortion that produced you?
Bynum Pulls Down 30::nice grammar, someone was there with him..lmao
Lakers 2009 world champions::I single-handedly drove 2 clowns/haters out of these boards. Time to drive the third one out.
buzzkill90265::wow I wish I was you!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Metta looks like he is finally healthy.
mvelt24::World Peace and Matt Barnes are playing great. If they keep playing like this, the Lakers are going to be hard to beat.
To many LeBron trolls::As long as Kobe passes the ball.
nba is the worst::Physically or mentally?
To many LeBron trolls::Never mentally
Bynum Pulls Down 30::He has 2 bulging discs in his back
boom.shaka.::I like Bynum too, but last night was the first time he's shot over 50% from the floor since Kobe went out - that's not good for a starting center.  It's not that complicated:  if you don't have to worry about the perimeter, you can collapse on the bigs;  and right now, Bynum struggles with it.
mvelt24::who cares if he doesnt over 50% a game. 43 45 % ill take.
Lakers 2009 world champions::30 vs Spurs and 8 vs Nuggets Duncan had 2 against him.  smd
nba is the worst::What's he avging for rebounds with kobe out?  Smh
Lakers 2009 world champions::As long as he grabs 30 rebounds and score 40-45% percent WITHOUT KOBE......we're good....
Lakers 2009 world champions::One of the many reasons Kobe is needed in order for the Lakers to win.
Lakers 2009 world champions::Dallas has no chance to repeat. They will get swept in the first round by the Lakers and it will be all over. The Spurs have no chance either. They will lose to the Lakers in the second round and the Spurs fans will once again disappear until the Spurs score another big winning streak next season.
To many LeBron trolls::Lakers suck on the road this year.
Lakers 2009 world champions::Not any more. They have won 11 of their last 12 road games.
Timmy D The Pro 4::The only bummer for the Lakers is that Kobe is coming back soon. Back to bummerville
mvelt24::when Kobe comes back he needs to feed it to Bynum more. Im telling they are a better team if Bynum can dominate the way he is.
Gibby1934::Did a Lakers fan really just say, Kobe needs to pass the ball, to his 7 ft tall center especially? Don't you remember what happened last time? See you later Bynum.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::So, will the Spurs become an official D-League team when Duncan retires?
Lakers 2009 world champions::Nah, more like the Bobcats of the D-League.
Timmy D The Pro 4::Back to bricking make you mad?
Lakers 2009 world champions::Back to early playoff exits will make you mad?
Lakers 2009 world champions::The only bummer for the Spurs is........................oh wait there's tons of them.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Ah, Dallas beat Houston 2-0 this season. Makes it more interesting
TubbyTime334::I Just Can't Wait for the Playoffs!!! They are going to be Dynamite!!!
Lakers 2009 world champions::Yeah, your team getting swept hard will be a dynamite.
Lakers 2009 world champions::Reality: -Lakers will sweep the Mavs and win every game by at least 15 points -Grizzlies will make it to the Western Conference Finals -Spurs will be ousted in the 2nd round -Heat will lose to either the Celtics or the Bulls -Lakers vs Bulls in the finals or Lakers vs Celtics at an extreme.
Gibby1934::Lakers lose in the 1st round and then trade bynum cause Kobe doesn't like not being the most important on the team.
willbuck231::wheres OKC in all this?
SCDodgersRaiders::OKC could lose to a very good Grizzlies team
TubbyTime334::You just said 15 min ago that Celts don't have a chance against Bulls or Heat. What Happened?
Lakers 2009 world champions::I said Lakers vs Celtics at an extreme. Lakers vs Bulls is far more likely.
TubbyTime334::By at least 15 Points. Your jokes are bad.
Lakers 2009 world champions::Reality sucks, doesn't it?
TubbyTime334::Dirk has actually played Very Well as of Late.
TubbyTime334::Maybe LA wins Vs Dallas but it sure wouldn't be a Sweep. Dirk has never gotten Swept in His Career.
mvelt24::Dallas killed everyone in the playoffs last year. not just LA.
boom.shaka.::Dallas killed LA at the #1 and behind the arc last year.  LA has improved in both areas and Dallas really hasn't.  They're still a good side with a great coach so I'm not gonna count them out.  But I'd have to say they are on the bottom looking up at this point -- too many teams with match up advantages ahead of them.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Dallas and LA won't meet in the playoffs. Mavs will drop a seed.
Bynum Pulls Down 30::Lakers put the Mavs down tomorrow and they are tied with Houston in the loss column
TubbyTime334::How Dallas created a little separation last night. I doubt  they aren't the 6th.
Timmy D The Pro 4::Dirk owns the Lakers J Kidd locked Kobe down last year. that was funny
mvelt24::Dallas killed everyteam in the playoffs last year. your acting Dallas only beat up on the Lakers. I mean they killed everyone last year not just the Lakers.
Lakers 2009 world champions::Dirk owned everyone last year. This year he is playing like average.
Lakers 2009 world champions::Phil Jackson had never been swept till last season. This season will be the first for Dirk.
TubbyTime334::Der MVP Is Boss
Lakers 2009 world champions::Nobody wants to see your ugly profile pick.
TubbyTime334::I can go to any board as I Please.
Lakers 2009 world champions::You GTFO bi.tch This is a lakers Board, you don't belong here!
TubbyTime334::Truth. GTFO.
Lakers 2009 world champions::Neither do you. At least I'm saying the truth.
TubbyTime334::You don't quit.
