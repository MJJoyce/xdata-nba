dc::Lou Williams has been garbage the entire season and Teague takes every other game off.  Crummy as hell.
dc::I appreciate what Coach Bud is doing and the effort this team puts forth every night, but the reality is...without Horford, the Hawks are lousy.
Spikes::As a Celtics fan I do know that Garnett and Pierce have always needed (and had) consistent minutes to be effective. These lineup and minute changes are messing with their game.
C K::Jason Kidd should stop changing his starting lineups, he can't build team chemistry that way.
BigBear::Constant lineup changes and inconsistent minutes to the players raise questions as to who Kidd thinks are his best players. The players must be totally confused. Why they thought a man who had no coaching experience could start his new career in the NBA is the big question.
PKM::Jason terry sucks
chuck d::Nets should be looking for the future and play Plumlee and Teltovic more, Garnett and Pierce shouldn't have been signed; they are both over the hill.
James::If the Nets bench those guys and play Plumless and Teltovic the league will investigate them
moviestallion::shouldn't blatche be starting over garnett
NOVOT::NEW ARENA OLD #$%$ TEAM CMON MAN
