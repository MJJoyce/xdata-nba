GoHorns::After watching Anthony Davis's recent development... he has the best chance of having the next quadruple double game.  He looks like very young and raw Hakeem out there.  Great quick movement of his feet that still needs to learn proper footwork.  Once he learns that, he'll be unstoppable.
Captin_Irk::Last nights game was not a surprise with them having a hard time closing it out with Dantoni so inconsistent at subbing players on a game by game basis. I am becoming a big Wesley Johnson fan as he is a team player, plays hard and can hit his shots well. Xavier Henry needs to be a better team player along with Nick Young which would make this team jell together better.  I still want to see Ryan Kelly get a few mins when the others struggle as he seems to shoot lights out.
Anton::Anthony Davis is growing up.
bluuzman::Lakers fading down the stretch as predicted. Tip of my hat to the Pelicans and Anthony Davis.
Don'T Feed Dooley::Whatever happened to Kevin Dooley?
Don'T Feed Dooley::Hey Mark hows Sacramento?
Akeal::I think the Lakers need a new tactic, announcing that Nash isn't playing well in advance is allowing teams to know who to focus on and who not to worry about. magic Mike needs to say Nash isn't playing then play his #$%$  We need to close ranks and keep stuff like who is playing or not close to out chest.  This game was an easy one and we screwed the pooch
dick::Just to remind the Laker fans. CP3 was traded for Aminu, Kaman, EGordon, AND the first round pick that became Anthony Davis. Now do you understand why the owner didn't want to be saddled with washed up players with boated salary? New Orleans got players at half the price and those players accounted for 64 points in this game, you wanted to trade them Gasol who scored 9.Understand yet?
PKM::Anthony Davis is a very good free throw shooter.
Rodney::Pelicans got this.
