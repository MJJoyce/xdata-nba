yeahgodisgood::I found a betting system recently called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system.

HateBrass::With the first pick of the 2013 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Bobcats trade David Stockton of Gonzaga for Jordan Taylor of Wisconsin.  ``You know the Jordan kid can play,'' Michael Jordan said. ``I think he was named after me because he does what I used to do.''
Antsea91::Jordan isn't in charge of the draft picks anymore so we won't be seeing any morrisons or kwames this time around. Cho actually knows what he's doing.
HateBrass::With the first pick of the 2013 NBA Draft, the Charloote Bobcats select Stu Douglass from Michigan. ``We needed a shooting guard to take pressure off of DJ and we feel Douglass is the best prospect at this position since Kobe enetered the league in 1996,'' Michael Jordan said. ``We feel we got the player to hold down this spot the next 10 years.''
HateBrass::With the first pick of the 2013 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Bobcats select Fab Melo, Syracuse.  ``We feel with a name like Fab (Jive) Melo, we can't lose with this pick,'' said team president Michael Jordan. ``He is the player that is going to make folks forget about the 1996 Bulls''.

Charlie Bailey Gates::Charlotte wont reach 10 wins by seasons end
nbahawksfan2::good job hawks
muchsack::Entire Hawks team scores in double digits.... Oh wait, versus KneelandBobcats doesn't count.
Erasisn::Bobcats are still an NBA team right? It counts, it just doesn't mean as much. . .
PrettyLillyFlower.::whoo go bobcats :)
itsnottagame::I'll be Returning to Kentucky next year   --Anthony Davis
CandySparker::Hawks Lotta Love!
aftern9ne::I DON"T KNOW WHAT RADIOACTIVITY HAS TO DO WITH DETONATING BUT YES IVAN IS $@%!$@% PEOPLE UP EITHER WAY
Terbmagic::Can SOMEONE please explain to me why Kemba Walker isn't playing 30+ minutes a game?!
woodyattjon::Kudos to whoever shows for a Bobcats home game this season
Jeff_ Teague::Good Game Bobcats fans. If you see Kemba crying in the locker room after the game, tell him I said it's alright, he's not the first one.  #MVTeague
CTthunder860::wow you really take d*ck riding to a nother level
tina n eric::you teague  r havin a good week
the hawks is the word::lol it so true sigh -_-
RadioheadFanBryan::HAHAHA NICE!
RadioheadFanBryan::11th straight loss in the 2nd double digit losing streak (IE 10+ games) this season.
ima brave falcon hawk::ivan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the hawks is the word::Ivan don't make splashes he makes tsunamis  -Chris Smoove
ZaZaFlockaATL::!!!!!!!!!!!!
Michael Bibby XIV::I just hope that the Hawks draft a center in this center rich draft.   Maybe Meyers Leonard or Arnett Moultrie can fall to us.
the hawks is the word::what are the chances of larry nance jr.
JulioJonesBrother::IDK if Meyers will be on the board, but he's really raw and can get a lot better. He'd be a good pickup. And Moultrie is a great player as well. Didn't know he was a C, thought a PF.
Michael Bibby XIV::All I know is that he's 6'11. Think he can play both positions.   I'd love either one of these guys, particularly Moultrie
JulioJonesBrother::GG Bobcats fans
SteveKerrsNads69::I feel bad for the Bobcats, they are just a sad group of players.
pelyplonkre::bobcats didn't pick kwame $@%!$@%..
Talentsojhin::We suck, but we don't have that centerpiece I feel worse for a team that sucks and has a centerpiece player already. I.E. Wizards.
SteveKerrsNads69::Good point.
SteveKerrsNads69::True true.
JulioJonesBrother::Kemba's a great piece to build on, and they'll have a lottery pick. Mullens is good, they can improve.
Michael Bibby XIV::At least they have that high draft pick
RadioheadFanBryan::How did that work out when they picked Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison?
Jeff_ Teague::Updated Bobcats team needs: PG, SG, SF, PF, C, Coach, GM, President, Owner
J-SMOOVE2048::FACT:  Hawks own the tiebreaker with the Pacers (won the season series 2-1).  The 3 seed is still possible.
Michael Bibby XIV::The Bobcats should at least look forward to getting Kemba a future running mate in this draft.  Whether they end up with the 1st pick, 2nd pick or 3rd pick, they'll have a future stud to play alongside another future stud PG.
SteveKerrsNads69::Thomas Robinson could be a legit NBA player.
SteveKerrsNads69::Kemba could be the next Morrison the way Jordan picks em.
RadioheadFanBryan::Kemba sure looked like anything but a future stud tonight!
JulioJonesBrother::Or Thomas Robinson, I love that guy.
Michael Bibby XIV::As do I JJ.  As do I.
JulioJonesBrother::Davis is overrated srs. They should get Brad Beal, MKG, Barnes, or Sullinger.
JulioJonesBrother::I agree. I don't like Davis's offensive game. Think he used a lot of his height and length in college to his advantage whereas in the NBA he'll be the same height as everyone else.
Michael Bibby XIV::I think that T. Robinson will have the best career of any player in this draft.   Great rebounders in college translate over into the NBA
ima brave falcon hawk::66 games felt like alot of games tbh
eric110377::Cute, you can hear this one older woman screaming "let's go bobcats."  Must be a player's mother
Michael Bibby XIV::I also can't believe that we're still paying Jason Collins to do nothing
Michael Bibby XIV::Wow, I can't believe we only have 9 games left in the regular season.
JulioJonesBrother::I like the 66 game schedule better though. 82 is too much.
Michael Bibby XIV::As do I. 82 games is too much. Plus, having 4 games a week is a nice plus too.
pseudoxan::The attendance for this game must be about 20 people.  7 of which are wearing Larry Johnson Hornet's jerseys.
Jeff_ Teague::If you look at the Bobcats record, you'd notice it's very same to the number of makes and shot attempts that Kobe produces in any given night.
JulioJonesBrother::Pacers lost tonight, we'll be a 1/2 game behind 3rd place once this game ends.
Michael Bibby XIV::A Celtics-Hawks series would be fun to watch, but Orlando is clearly the favorable matchup. Also, there is still the possibility that we could end up facing Philly if Orlando continues to sputter.
JulioJonesBrother::I'd want to get the 3 seed to play ORL in the 2nd round w/ home-court instead of play the Celtics who are hot and we wouldn't have home-court. We can beat either team though.
Michael Bibby XIV::Playoffs are a lot closer than I thought. Hadn't really payed much attention to the standings until only a few days ago.
eric110377::I miss ya M. Bibby!  No body missed a shot so skillfully as you
Jeff_ Teague::The Hawks starting PG they have now is much better than Bibby.
Michael Bibby XIV::Yeah, that guy is pretty good
eric110377::My point exactly
Michael Bibby XIV::Bibby sucks

Jeff_ Teague::If the Bobcats draft Anthony Davis next year, they would rival the Bulls as the ugliest team in the NBA, already with Byron Mullens.
Michael Bibby XIV::How fortunate that us Hawks fans get to talk to Ivan Johnson and apparently now Jeff Teague during Hawks games.
Jeff_ Teague::I figured I'd give Jannero and Willie some extra minutes tonight.
ima brave falcon hawk::jeff teague and zaza flocka yall need to be in more games we comment on
eric110377::Shaq-Shaq with another rebound
Jeff_ Teague::The Bobcats are the only team in the NBA who's best player is the owner of the franchise.
Michael Bibby XIV::Zaza with a very Ivan-like game tonight
JulioJonesBrother::<i>Ivan</i> with a very Ivan-like game as well.
Michael Bibby XIV::Very true
ZaZaFlockaATL::Bobcats making me look like Shaq out there.
Cleveland_SportsDVR::Jordan is slowly building a nasty squad
J-SMOOVE2048::suck dick nasty?
Jeff_ Teague::Big game against the Celtics next week. Gonna show Rondo how we shoot jump shots in the NBA.
Larke30864::Lmao.
J-SMOOVE2048::$@%!
ima brave falcon hawk::jeff teague!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jeff_ Teague::That's me.
JulioJonesBrother::MVTeague
KONY4PREZ::Oh boy I called the Bobs,gonna work out a 5 yr deal tomorrow.
