Liltexaschic::Hmm....what happened to the other SEC 140? Go Rockets!
DanielFury::You missed it?
ChrisBC07::I was at the game last night it was incredible. Houston sure is showing how tough of a team they are. Granted they make it to the playoffs, they will be a dangerous first round team and may just play spoiler. I'm excited for the Rockets. They played tough and physical, but unfortunately it wasn't enough.
Antsea91::CHRIS PAUL IS A POOR MAN'S VERSION OF RAJON RONDO.
r8rdixie5::Except people guard Rondo 5 feet off the ball because he shoots like you and me.
PortlandBlazers1004::Deron WIlliams Derrick Rose Chris Paul
Joey Phase::Rondo
r8rdixie5::Deron Williams is such an unbelievable PG he has carried his team to what record again?
J.Shelton44::Chris Paul is hands down the best point guard in the NBA. Look at what he does night in and night out. Him and Blake griffin are the best point guard and power forward combination in the NBA right now!
r8rdixie5::I disagree, Blake has no post moves/no outside shot.
HTownRprsntr::I went to the game last night, and I have to say I think Chris Paul whines more than Kobe does....dude expects a foul every time he drives to the basket or every time someone steals the ball from him.
Jalfmar3::If they're not going to use Budinger, please package him and trade him. No he's not Larry Bird but he has a value unless they let him continue to sit. The league's going to think there's really something wrong with him. Put him with Scola and throw in Terrence Williams and Jordan Hill if you have to. I like Jordan, but I could live with that trade. You might get a decent 4 for that. At least see what you can do. Chase is the best cutter the Rockets have. Parsons is really the only other cutter we have.
kezmicdust::Why all the hate for KMart? He did really well - 10pts and 7rebs - just what you need from your backup PF. ;-)
1226LAZ::HELLO
1226LAZ::CAN YOU CANCELL A TRANSACTION I A BETTING SITE
cellus24::Chris paul was talking about the win on clippers live. And bout how he almost cost the clippers the game with that bad drive to the basket in the 4th quater http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Tcx3LMRN9k&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C3e60...67fUDOEgsToPDskLxFAPiQFAIOItJ--mGlis4
johnsmith15york::check out rockets and clippers trade rumours here (clips looking for allen or crawford, looking ot shop foye) more here http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
PadresChargersClippers::Crawford would be great. What are the chances they pull that off?
jpnt17::Clippers are really missing eric gordon right now...
Dogsniper007::hes even weaker than D-Wade
PadresChargersClippers::I love Gordon but he's very injury prone.
OOHnirav::If they traded back for him, I'd be willing to bet that they'd miss Chris Paul more.
Jg2.o::Cheesy Kia commercials and overhype. Getting rid of Darrell. Floppers, bitchers and sh.t talkers. How do you get yourself to support that kind of nonsense.
Jg2.o::What do expect out of coach that jumps off the bench to distract three pt shooters. This whole organization is bull pucky.
Clipshow07::Wow, I'd have to say we were fortunate to pull this one out tonight. Our defense continues to struggle and we are way too dependent on our offense. We have got to get some defensive consistency going or we aren't going anywhere in the playoffs. VDN needs to pull his head out and focus on defense....the problem is he can't. CP3 looked like he wanted to win tonight. Let's hope we can back this one up in Minny tomorrow.
AceVenturaMavsCoach::Please beat Minny tomorrow. It'll help their fans shut up
OOHnirav::I'm hoping for a good game. I'm a big fan of both teams right now (I hope that doesn't make me seem too bangwagon-y).
r8rdixie5::Minnesota is a tough match-up for the Clippers and they are in the middle of a longer road trip right now...I don't see them pulling it out without a fight.
adrudi775::is Patrick Patterson injured? Did he get injured in this game?
r8rdixie5::Blake and the rest of this squad need to pick up their scoring to help out CP3 on offense.  Or the coach needs to mix in some actual play calls aside from Iso's.
clippersfan2407::VdN has actually done surprisingly well if you think of the following.  1) no practice time players still only been together 34 games. 2) did not have a big fan off the bench until 8 games in (evans) and then kmart who they have only had 12 games. And still doesn't have a backup center. 3) Billups been hurt 13 games bledsoe missed first 25 and is still basically getting into shape. 4)Has had no backup small forward all year.  So VDN has had to coach a team the had no depth up front for half the season. Has been stuck with a backcourt that has an undersized backup sg starting and a pg tryiung to play sg when the real pg is in. So a bunch of players new to each other with a supreme lack of depth at various times throughout the season. Which caused him to have to over play players for the beginning of a lockout season. Let The man have a full season with a full team before you start begging for his head and killing the man. True long term clipper fans should be enjoying that we are actually competitive team and stop acting like knicks/laker fans all of a sudden. Its only halfway through the season and they are 9 games over .500 and in position to make a trade to improve the team relax and enjoy the ride. Because DTS could blow this all up two years from now and youll spend the whole time $@%!$@%! about refs and VDN
JeremyLinTimTebow...::Chill out with your essay.  True Clipper fans can enjoy the success while lamenting their shortcomings. A team as talented as this shouldn't lose consistently to the Timberwolves, get beat by the Warriors and the Suns. There is plenty of room for improvement.
Soonerhopeful1::Play calls...?  you mean VDN is supposed to have play calls ?   No one told VDN..!
Clipshow07::VDN does not know how to run any plays and he doesn't know how to play defense either. It's amazing what we have done so far with him at the helm. Hopefully, when Chauncey comes back he will act as the proxy/psuedo coach.
PadresChargersClippers::They need a pure shooting guard, plain and simple.
topbanana_14::Take note McHale... DON'T EVER LET K-MART HAVE THE LAST POSSESSION. Just don't.
oneandonlyzk5::Nothing is worse than seeing fans complain about the refs... smh.. It was a good game but people never look at it that way because they want to make an excuse.. come on.
PadresChargersClippers::Both teams shot nearly exactly the same amount of FTs. This game wasn't rigged, plus both teams were flopping.
3rdCoastTexan::way to bring an intelligent point to the conversation...i am drunk and i can still form a more coherent sentence than you...much appreciated
KrispyKid62::Boo ...frickin... hoo.
3rdCoastTexan::lol ya the facts i have presented show my lack of knowledge. I dont care about losing...a higher draft pick would be better for the future of the rockets. I just want to see the game officiated fairly and it rarely is. But if you have to try and vindicate yourself by talking to someone else instead of responding to me, then thats cool
oneandonlyzk5::this texan guy just lacks knowledge.. thanks for proving a point there.. lol he's crying cuz the loss.. i mean hell if clippers lost i wouldnt have been crying about the refs.
3rdCoastTexan::ya until you have a former ref that was indicted admit that he purposefully called fouls on your team during a playoff series so that they would lose, you should probably keep your mouth shut....Rockets have documentation of being screwed by the league on more than one instance...look at the trade that was vetoed this year for a recent reference. NBA = crooked
3rdCoastTexan::Clippers are better than the Rockets, im not going to deny that, but the rockets would have won this game if it was officiated fairly...and it wasnt. Rockets need some allstars and fast
OOHnirav::...or it could be because most teams don't expect Rockets's players to make their shots, so they don't go for hard fouls or take unnecessary risks. Rockets lost, because they didn't do as well as the team they faced tonight.
3rdCoastTexan::there is a direct correlation to # of allstars on a team and number of FT attempts they get, hence why the Rockets are last in FT attempts....a foul is a foul no matter who is committing it. "Oh but that was Chris Paul, so it must not have been a foul...i will let it slide"
3rdCoastTexan::it just another case that the NBA is crooked...whether it was aimed to screwed the Lakers, Rockets or Hornets is irrelevant (all 3 teams got screwed). Look up Tim Donaghy and Rockets-Mavs playoffs series...Rockets fans have court documentation of being screwed over by the league...i think we have a right to complain about the refs. Even when we had allstars, we rarely got the calls that some other teams get (Yao was one of the most poorly officiated players in the history of the league - he literally had scratches up and down his arms from getting hacked every time he touched the ball)
oneandonlyzk5::i should keep my mouth shut? naa you should stop crying. You act like that trade was intended to hurt the rockets. It was vetoed to hurt the lakers!! so they wouldnt get a star pg.. so.. are you going to keep talking and making your self seem like an idiot? you're teams problem isnt the refs, it's the fact you have a sg that wants to shoot the ball 24/7 and takes worse looks than monta ellis. Get real.
DL_0521::they shouldn't have given it to KMart at the end of the game they should have gave it to Lowry to do a pick and roll situation with Scola so he could drive and try and get to the line or kick it back to Scola for an open jumper but anything is better then giving it to Martin smh
AceVenturaMavsCoach::Don't feel too bad. At least the Spurs are losing
Jg2.o::Darrell is a free agent - needs to go to the Mavs. Cuban treats his guys well.
tmfaherty::Awwwwww
AceVenturaMavsCoach::Yea the plus 1 free throw advantage in favor of the clippers Really indicated that the refs help them tonight
AceVenturaMavsCoach::NBA has been crooked. trust me I know
3rdCoastTexan::Rockets are last in free attempts in the league because they dont have any allstars...NBA is crooked. period
OOHnirav::The Rockets don't have any All Stars, because they don't have anyone who knows how to draw a foul. This group of Rockets aren't good. Period.
AceVenturaMavsCoach::Tell that to the Mavs man. Or anybody who plays the Lakers.
3rdCoastTexan::if you didnt watch, the you would NOT know...Clippers were getting superstar calls left and right.  Rockets dont ever get those sort of calls
KrispyKid62::Boo...frickin...hoo
tmfaherty::Give me a brake. The refs. jerk
Edudlufetips::is your car not stopping?
OutOnStrikes11::The refs blew this game for the Rockets
AceVenturaMavsCoach::"Kevin Martin should have passed the ball"  Lebron James
Jordsta4Life::he will learn, he can study your highlights
TylerDurden1200::why did anybody on houston pass the ball to Kevin Martin, he jacked up everything as soon as he touched it
PadresChargersClippers::TRADE IDEA:  Clippers get: Crawford  Blazers get: Foye, Mo Williams.  Thoughts? Adjustments?
Dogsniper007::bad deal but with just Foye for Crawford
DBeezy313z::Too risky, Mo Williams can actually play on the same level alone. Plus, Crawford is questionable on durability.
shivyjr::if the blazers throw in brandon roy
tmfaherty::The Houston coach needs to get a high schoul coach to teach and offense. Four guys standing around watching one dribbling  like a mouse being chased just is so boring and so easy to defense.
Jordsta4Life::I bet i could beat all yr $@%!$ on Just dance 2!   - lebron james
SteveO3912::Kevin Martin... keep shooting your team into the L column..
shivyjr::he made 10/10 on the free throw and shot 6/22 from the field
oneandonlyzk5::i do agree with you at most part.. cuz they really struggled guarding cp3 (my fav player) but.. i think kmart did mess them up a couple times.. maybe not some bad looks but a couple turnovers.. other than that he had a pretty solid performance.
Edudlufetips::hes the sg... meaning ... SHOOTING guard. you have bad nights at times, and they still only lost by 2. the problem wasn't having your designated scorer taking shots and missing, because his aggressiveness led to free throws, points, and 8 assists. the problem was their approach to guarding chris paul.
Edudlufetips::uhh.... most assists on the team and i believe his season high. he was not the reason they lost this game. lowry is a solid defender, but cp3 is just too smart and smooth to have a good but not great pg guard him effectively
AceVenturaMavsCoach::Clips have a look of a championship team. Much better then that other crap team in Los Angeles
davecardin::Wow, there was a time out when I turned it on, trying to get it on TV Internet, .04 seconds and Clips down by 1, finally had to come here to see what happened and POOF, Clips win, so must have been a great last 4 secs.  Go LA, Clips and Lakers!  Masked Mamba took on Prince James and humiliated them.  Band wagoneers should be packing it up and moving west, LA has two teams worth watching if the Lakers show up to play, the Clips are always great to watch but now we get to see or hear WINS!
davecardin::Yep, got off the band wagon when Elgin showed up and Chickie Baby reved up his voice.  Been riding that wagon now for 52 years
crawnjc1982::Congragulations! you sound like a total bandwagoner yourself.
Jordsta4Life::Damn kmart, u make me look good!  signed,  lebron james
ninjaplatypus13::The Rockets coach needs to play parsons more, he would definitely help and they prob would have won.
MetropolitanFan4Life::Wow Houston ..you suck
crawnjc1982::how the hell do the clips beat a good houston team on the road but seem to lose to the weak a$$ twolves @ home, wtf?
crawnjc1982::more like LOVE/BEASLEY combo. Rubio sucks vs the clippers.
davecardin::Get Rubio another month of rookie "raw" mistakes and he goes into another level.  He's cocky, but confidence in the NBA is different than in Europe.  These guys will smoke you and their wing span tips or steals a lot of passes he's not used to.  Lin will and is having the same problem, TO's.  Love isn't even 24 yet, oh no!
Edudlufetips::the rockets have had lots of trouble with minnesota as well. rubio/love combination gives certain teams fits. the ironic thing is kevin mchale coached their previously. you'd think he'd know a thing or two about how they work.
DiesUnus::agreed. Clips in desperate need of a 2 guard
PadresChargersClippers::Match up problem?
crawnjc1982::i dont know. That game had me scratching my head, and giving up 72 bench pts? I couldnt believe it. But then they can go to phoenix and play well, and go to houston and get a win......SMH.
PadresChargersClippers::Literally not hating, but are there rocket fans? Or I guess they have a life.
gotemcoach92::I'm right here!
TylerDurden1200::Kevin Martin 0-4 2 turnovers in OT, but he made both his free throws
shivyjr::"Man how does chris paul do it" -Lebron James
shivyjr::chris paul wants the ball like the the heat vs the jazz Lebron passed the ball and they lost
Jordsta4Life::he takes what he wants, like Delonte.
DBeezy313z::To any real Rockets fans out there, good game. I was on the edge of my seat during the 4th and OT. Your team played good.  Huge thanks to Chris Paul and Mo Williams for keeping up in this game. I love it when a team can flow in times when it's necessary.
MadmanMark14::Money talks BS Walks .........that one is free Clippers fans
Jordsta4Life::k.mart you wanna join my gang?  - lebron james.
PadresChargersClippers::CP3s stats may not be as amazing as Lebron/Kobe/Durant but he's won so many games for us this year, you really have to watch the games to appreciate what he does for this team, especially in the 4th.
PadresChargersClippers::Yeah, but people just glance at his stats and hate that stern thing and decide to ignore what he's accomplished this season.
Mattdawg835::he's the 2nd leading scorer in the NBA in the 4th quarter
Mattdawg835::The Staples Center "Home of the Clippers" get out of our building... Lakers
clippsallday::Haha id love to have them here in sd, but yea no ones a winner here in sd :/ haha
Dogsniper007::SD Sports are cursed
PadresChargersClippers::I'd rather them move out of L.A and get their own new arena. F*ck los angeles.
crawnjc1982::san diego doesn't deserve another basketball franchise.
njktmac213::Can we trade Kevin Martin's $@% for draft picks? Can't hit anything in crunchtime.
PadresChargersClippers::Nope, I watch the games and that is all he does.
PadresChargersClippers::How bout Blake? All he does is dunk.
DBeezy313z::^Only watches highlights
cellus24::Big win for us tonight. But now we gotta get revenge on those $@%!$ $@% timberwolves. They won the the last two games and we can not lose to them again. I'm not gonna let kevin love score the game winner again http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Tcx3LMRN9k&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C3e6067fUDOEgsToPDskLxFAPiQFAIOItJ--mGlis4 this $@%! makes me sick
PadresChargersClippers::Chris Paul is the only reliable player on this team.
BRAY5150::We need to realise how far we have come in one year. We are I'm 1st place I'm happy
PadresChargersClippers::true but these games are way to close for me to enjoy. at least theres too many of these games.
BRAY5150::But really that's all u want at the end of a game right? As long as the team gets you to that point I'm ok with it
