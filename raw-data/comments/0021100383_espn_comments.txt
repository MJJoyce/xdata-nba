mark35345::The Blazers really only play well against the Lakers - too bad there's no chance they'll play them in the playoffs
IcompletelyforgotwhoIam::I don't know what the hell is going on with this Blazers team but it is not good. A real bummer considering how hot they started. They just don't seem to be able to play sound fundamental basketball for 48 minutes. Sometimes they can only manage it for a quarter or two. They have the talent but the talent  is not meshing the way it could be. Despite my defending Nate on this earlier I am beginning to see that he just may not be able to get the best out of his players. Although I do see him riding them throughout the game, they just don't seem to respond all too frequently.  One thing that is for sure is the Blazers lack confidence in the end of games. It has been way too common to see them go completely cold in the waning minutes of games. I can't figure out what the biggest obstacle is though. Yesterday it was Batum and Aldridge being ice cold for most of the game that seemed to hurt them the most.
ban94shee::Blazers will be regretting that odom pick for a long time...Durant is a freak!
terrapin3dixon::Um...what an idiot.
IcompletelyforgotwhoIam::Odom? Pretty damn sure you mean Oden.
jpatten5::By this time in the season you should know where your team is at...if there is no improvement before the trade deadline I wouldnt be suprised if portland is a seller rather then a buyer.  Can still build around Aldridge, Batum...rest of the cast down the road is expendable.
spotchester::The Blazers are mediocre.  Blow it up and rebuild.  Keep LMA if you have to, but understand he's not a #1.  I'm fine with some lottery seasons if I can watch a team that plays hard and doesn't make dumb mistake after dumb mistake.  -  Realistic Blazer fan
H-TownTEX5040::We'll take LMA off your hands
DuaneXC::We'll trade you some good young pieces to start with too.
Logicalfan1::So... Blazers.. You can start playing at anytime.... If you aren't going to, then Develop Elliott Williams..... He has D-rose like potential, keyword Potential. But with more hops and taller. Decide which SF you are going to keep. We can't keep both sadly enough. Which everyone knows that means the older one is the one that goes, as much as we all want to keep him around. Trade him, don't let him walk. And do SOMETHING in FA next season. Because this season which easily could have been a 40-26 or better season at the start. Is looking to be more of a 36-30 at best. And if Paul Allen isn't going to "Spend money to get players" get us a new owner and stop hogging all the cash.
jairushawkins::Chase Budinger obviously wants his Starting Job Back should mchale consider ?
Josh4274::Yikes... that was an alarming loss for the Blazers. Got beat by the bench players. Way to go Rockets! Let's make some noise!
58rhodes::Happy trails to 500 and less. Rise with Us is officially over.
ThirdCoastTexan::http://houston.culturemap.com/newsdetail/02-09-12-houston-rockets-tweak-dallas-mark-cuban-by-landing-nba-all-star-game-three-peat-with-bold-bid/  Who the F cares what Cuban thinks, and get off Jerry's jock, Cuban...The deathstar in Dallas is not a basketball stadium.  Also, its pretty funny that Stern was asked about the vetoed trade that screwed the Rockets over and why Leslie Alexander and Daryl Morey werent present  for his announcement that Houston would get the 2013 All-Star game. Les and Morey are boycotting Stern because he is a crook....good for them. Stern is trying to buy Houstonians off with this game...wont work on me, Mr. Commissioner
PortBlazerFan22::Someone needs to rip the Blazer players a new $@% hole because the lack of motivation they're showing is unacceptable...wait isn't that Nate's job.
Logicalfan1::I think Nate is just as dumbfounded by their play as we are.
58rhodes::Nate is dumbfounded--period.
abenezer44::blazers have talent all over it makes no sense why they struggle
Kobelies247::You dont? One name...  NATE!!!
Kobelies247::THIS JUST IN: BLAZERS OUT OF PLAYOFFS!
Hi i love my bike::Even if they make it they'll be out in the first round like always.
Kobelies247::Yup
Hi i love my bike::Jeremy Lin &gt; Blazers
Hi i love my bike::Wow, Blazers are terrible
Rip_City27::Kobelies I'm sick of u dude get a life seriously hater
Kobelies247::DOnt worry rip, blazers will beat a bad team soon and you can come back out here a BRAG BRAG BRAG!!!!  LOL
Kobelies247::Coming from a blazer fan? hahahaha :D
Rip_City27::So are you saying the Blazers still would have lost if that call hadn't been made?? Rebounds are irrelvant to the fact that Scott Foster won the game for the Thunder.. You sure aren't that smart for being an old guy
Kobelies247::LOL Thats right blame the refs for getting out rebounded by 20!!!   Pathetic
Rip_City27::Really?? Seems to me like it was 2 games ago where they killed Denver, and one game ago where we should have beat the best team in the NBA barring a bull sh*t call
Kobelies247::Ya, at the begining of the season when everybody was still figuring things out...  30 games in and what has portland figured out?  Oh, that right HOW TO LOSE!!!
Rip_City27::Hmm well they already beat some very good teams so I dont see what case you're trying to make here..
Kobelies247::Make your team play better then
Rip_City27::Not worried come playoff time, this team wont miss the playoffs trust me, then we'll see from there..
o07JamesBond::Comment? Yes, I think I will. Time to rip my beloved Blazers. Pathetic. ABSOLUTELY pathetic. Awful defense especially on the pick-n-roll, awful rotating and getting out to Budinger, Lee, or Lowry. Imagine if K-Mart would have had an average game? Typical situation you dig a hole too big to come back from 19 points, then expend apparently too much energy to get back into the game. Oh I see? So, we play half-$@% run of the mill defense, but decide for 8 minutes or so to ramp up our defensive intensity in which Houston began to crumble, but of course we couldn't sustain that level of effort. Professional athletes can't even motivate themselves to put forth the effort and energy it takes to not only compete, but to be a playoff caliber team. Pathetic. Is this Nate's fault? His coaching style perhaps? It seems he doesn't motivate the guys enough, it seems he does not get the most out of his players, but c'mon can we truthfully place blame on the coach. I mean, these are supposed to be professional athletes, right? /Rant.
natskivna::Too much talent on that Blazers team to be struggling like this....but credit Houston.  They really came to play tonight and shot lights out.
Kobelies247::Firing NATE will be a GREAT start.....
Rip_City27::Dam.. Nice job Rockets yall came to play
DuaneXC::Read a lot of disparaging remarks about the Blazers on here and I'm not sure they are warranted.  Houston has won twelve of their last sixteen.  Just a week ago they lost on their homefloor to Minnesota and people buried them.  Your team will be fine.
Kobelies247::Blazers just stink!
Rip_City27::Yeah ok kwer
Commissioner.David.Stern::good game
natskivna::Nice road win Rockets.  Next up....the Suns.
Kobelies247::19 Turnovers LOL!!!!!  God this team is amazing!!!
Rip_City27::LOLLOLOLOLOL SO FUNNY!!!
Kobelies247::Lamarsh was sick!!!!  THATS WHY THEY DIDNT WIN!!! I KNEW IT
dgpdx::Canby has bronchitis too. Maybe that explains his short minutes.
Kobelies247::And felton is fat!   NO wonder!!!
Nacho8849::<b>Has anyone REALLY been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?</b>
Kobelies247::lol
Nacho8849::<i>I didn't know</i>
roymullins::For years, I've figured he would eventually move the team to Seattle. Maybe this will speed it up. ---------------------------- years? there was a team there until '09... maybe now but years ago?
rocketsin05::Portland is a great NBA market no way Stern would let them relocate!!!
dgpdx::Allen is a hero up there for saving the Seahawks. If he brought the NBA back, he'd be a God.
dgpdx::LIke I said -- eventually.
Kobelies247::MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!!
Kobelies247::ANOTHER QUIET NIGHT IN PTOWN!!!!  Just how i like it :)
Nacho8849::<b>CRICKET CRICKET</b>
drewfrankel12::So I heard Lowry got hurt...what about K martin I saw he only got like 15 mins. any reason in particular?
DuaneXC::If someone runs cold Kevin McHale sits him.  I thought this guy was a buffoon in Minnesota but, he seems to be doing a bang up job with a so-so lineup here.
Seven13Hou::I hope he gets it going against the suns
drewfrankel12::haha fair enough then....Ive never seen another player who runs so hot and cold
dgpdx::Yes, he stunk tonight.
Gobi Sith::Im trying to figure out who the worst starting pg in the league is out of Felton and Devin Harris?
Nacho8849::<b>WHAT'S HAPPENING</b>
Nacho8849::<pre>You didn't tell me this was plausible</pre>
Nacho8849::<b>BITCH YOU DON'T KNOW ME</b>
zero_reincarnated::Just stop talking to yourself dumba$$
Nacho8849::<i>No</i>
zero_reincarnated::NBA &lt; blazers &lt; Vomit
Kobelies247::Rocket fans you should be thanking Steve Nash!!!
Zeeshan2::why nash?
Seven13Hou::yea like im ever gonna see Nash .....LOL
Seven13Hou::Rockets bench played like starters ...lol good win Rockets on to Phoenix !
Seven13Hou::yea they did a hell of a job in a tough place to play like that ......even Jordan Hill who drives me crazy somtimes
dgpdx::Props to Coach McHale for sticking with the guys who were getting it done.
dgpdx::No more excuses, Blazers are simply not the team we thought they were. Will have to fight to make playoffs for another one and done.
Nacho8849::<b><u>They are who we thought they were...</u></b>
Nacho8849::<pre>wait what did you say? ok</pre>
Kobelies247::+100
Kobelies247::Just now figuring that out?
dgpdx::No, but finally admitting the obvious.
Kobelies247::LA = 5 REBOUNDS!!!! ALLSTAR?????
Gobi Sith::Ya he's a all star.. 24 and 8 is should get him in.
Kobelies247::PA SELL THIS TEAM!!!!!!
JimboNoyes::blazers will never get moved.... t
roymullins::PA does live in Seattle....
dgpdx::For years, I've figured he would eventually move the team to Seattle. Maybe this will speed it up.
roymullins::yeah- to an out-of-town buyer who will move 'em
Kobelies247::Seattle?

Nacho8849::<b>what did you say</b>
Gobi Sith::Roy Muffins is a Bobcats fan..
zero_reincarnated::B-Roy is a Sonics fan... lol
roymullins::Felton and Aldridge should be all stars though ---------------------------- FELTON?  Are you kidding me?  I'll give you Aldridge but Felton? No chance... he is awful!
roymullins::I hope so but it sounds like a Portland fan statement- they think that every player on their roster, past or present, is a Hall of Famer...
Gobi Sith::I was just kidding about felton there
Domino6O6::Did Camby get hurt? Only 18 mins.
zero_reincarnated::No, he told nate to f-off when he was pulled.
dgpdx::The Blazers togetherness is fragile, as is their mental state.

roymullins::whoa! I thought Portland, "has more talent than we have had in several season.."  I thought Portland was "2nd or 3rd in the west"  I heard, "no way Portland loses in the first round this year."   Portland fans bailing out?    Of course I said early that you were .500  OK I predicted that you would go 0-66 but after I stopped drinking I said you were .500  now how much of a chump do you think old Roy Mulllins is Portland?
roymullins::Hornets huh? when do they play Portland?
rjerden70::Who cares about Portland anyways
Kobelies247::Youre here?
roymullins::and I answered... whoever is playing Portland...
Gobi Sith::Ok its the Hornets
Kobelies247::yes he did!!!
Kobelies247::I know right?
Gobi Sith::Who is your team Roy Muffins? Ive asked before..
Gobi Sith::Felton and Aldridge should be all stars though.
Gobi Sith::Just kidding about Felton obviously
Kobelies247::ALLSTARS  win games!
Gobi Sith::Then Melo shouldn't be playing
Kobelies247::NATE CANT EVEN SPEAK!!! HAHAHHAHA

Gobi Sith::When i wake up tmrw morning i better see that Nate was fired or all hell will break loose.
zero_reincarnated::Won't happen, he just upped his membership as a vulcan.
roymullins::Portland currently 9th in the west...  5-5 in their last 10 games  almost at the 1/2 way point in the season  at this point you are what you are...   Psuckland is not very good...
