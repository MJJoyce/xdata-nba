Rdhutchi::Best dunk montage I've seen in a while Check this out if you love dunks!!!!!!!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDc-di5kIek
AC2020x::Any Chance the Bird will ever play again?!?
AC2020x::Awesome Win Nugs!  This one was big.. and its been tough for us on the road.  Close game.. I was getting scared towards the end there!
H-TownTEX5040::Good win Nuggets, Rockets didnt deserve those to win these last two games...
paul2285::Huge W, but they need to hold court against the Clips tomorrow
buffnaustin::Maybe I misread it but why would there be an ulterior motive this late in the season. Shouldn't they play that way all year?
paul2285::you would think, but this team has been up and down all year.  I think they're starting to grow up a little though
vandeman34::"Karl is guaranteed to finish with a winning record for the 20th straight season." Fire GK petition doesn't like this
b2msbro::Heyoooo the nuggets are kinda looking like their old self!! How are ya all doin on this fine monday night/tuesday mornin!!
jayeteee::Big win tonight. I didn't think we'd do it, but I guess that's what I get for thinking. The Nuggets really are starting to play better together. If we can stay away from key injuries down the stretch, we could make a nice little play-off push. Most definitely need to avoid OKC in the 1st round. Go Nuggets!!!!!
Meet Friar Manning::lets get that 5 seed and tear up the clippers in the first round, though then wed have a 2nd round thunder matchup
KG is a Bi456::Looks like houstons not gonna make the payoffs this year. Good riddance. They need to work on getting a big time free agent
Meet Friar Manning::Only way they get a big time player is in a trade, nobody noteworthy is goin to houston in free agency
GerardoE303::cant sleep -___- anyone here?
kicked off again1::yeah....the nuggets suck
Meet Friar Manning::Tell em Fred! Hoo Hoo Hoo
diehardnr1::Huge W Denver!!  After it seemed like every WC team would own the tie breaker vs Nuggz, they now have important ones with HOU and PHX.  Playoffs are closer to being a reality and keeping the 6 spot is vital...possible for the 5... and if they beat the Clipps, the 4 is not out of reach. On the other side, a slight stumble could put them on the outside looking in...fun season...nervous but fun.  Gotta love the playoff intensity the young Nuggz are showing...Ty was huge with the dagger 3 and the Bigs played solid after a shaky start. Seems like the Nuggets have started to find a little chemistry with the role players able to get back to their roles. Brewer has been great at what he does...bring late game intensity on D and spark the fast break... the decrease in minutes has helped Harrington even with the meniscus tear.  Hopefully Nuggz are getting back to early season form with good team play and depth leading the way!  GO NUGGETS!!!
