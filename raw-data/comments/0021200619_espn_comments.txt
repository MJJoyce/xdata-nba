cbbaseball19::See ya
Aicyla22::good night
MiamiFan2004::Aicyla22 - i think youre lying but either way ive never heard of that movie before and also i hate pelicans and they hate me back --- No lie, it's a movie with Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts.  Coincidentally I volunteer here once a month, after I rescued an injured cormorant.  It's in Miami, if they hate you, then steer clear of this place, this is where they heal and rescue injured seabirds. http://pelicanharbor.org/
Aicyla22::no i believe you about the movie part, i dont believe they named the team after the movie.  i hate pelicans bc ive been attacked on 2 separate occasions by them.  Once when i was little one tried to put me its its mouth flap/sack thingy and it got my leg in and my dad had to pull me out. thats nice that you volunteer though
MiamiFan2004::when i said Lebron had the biggest choke job ever against the Mavs why would you bring up when Wade went off and the heat won?  -- You said LeBron lost in the biggest choke job in HISTORY, I showed a bigger choke job that did not involve LeBron.  You were wrong. i know you want to prove me wrong but Lebron was not on that team. sorry i think you might need the history lesson   -- No, you inbred moron, the discussion was that LeBron would have 2 Finals MVPs in 3 years with MIAMI.  You then said he had gone 1-3 in finals appearances.  That was wrong, wrong, wrong, moron.  Learn to read.  Better yet, learn how to find the BULLS BOARD , you obsessed piece of diseased sputum.
MiamiFan2004::He has earned it.  I like to have fun, but this guy is obsessed and throws out all kinds of personal insults, he deserves some of his own back.  Golden Rule and all that...
cbbaseball19::I dont think hes here :)

MiamiFan2004::Aicyla22 - i stopped there 1 time on my way back from atlanta for some tacos, they were good  Those poor kittens.  You notice there are no cats near the taco stands in gainesville, right?
Aicyla22::i stopped there 1 time on my way back from atlanta for some tacos, they were good
cbbaseball19::I will never ever in my life go to Gainesville unless Miami is playing there.
Aicyla22::thats how i feel about UF
cbbaseball19::I will never be jealous of someone going to UCF.  Been there way too many times.  Everyone and their mother from my high school went there.  Im glad I did not attend that school
Aicyla22::aka jealousy

cbbaseball19::It looks like the one in my avatar lol
lebron-is-a-champion::i seriously dont understand how people still say kobe is better than lebron...kobe shoots 9-30 like almost every night while lebron is at 50% and normally much higher. all kobe does better is scores, but lebron could average as much as kobe easily if he wanted
Djuki 3::the only people who say that are Laker fans, Kobe fans, and Lebron dislikers
lebron-is-a-champion::so since when do they start blocking out b.utthurt? see, $@%!$@%!
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::this game would be more interesting if girls were playing.
Djuki 3::girl*
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::i know i was messing with you duh
Djuki 3::i meant there's only one girl here
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::girl scouts?
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::would you rather be a pro athlete, musician or actor
cbbaseball19::athlete
lebron-is-a-champion::athlete
Djuki 3::athlete without the injuries
RunTheBall22_-_::get a life, son
lebron-is-a-champion::lebron is better than kobe already
RunTheBall22_-_::says the guy who comes to the heat board to play would you rather. lol, i talk ball you just.... well i don't know what you do, you just kind of putz around in here. alright im out. and remember-- Lebron has a long way to go before he can even catch Kobe.
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::says the bulls troll on the heat board.
Djuki 3::you are such a rascal
GaspoMinnyFan981::Athlete
lebron-is-a-champion::not the best game but im glad we got the W. go heat
RunTheBall22_-_::lockout champion
lebron-is-a-champion::since when is b.utthurt a bad word?
lebron-is-a-champion::ha is someone $@%!$@%!?

Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::i get it cuz youre a kitty
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::definitely stabbed, waters are scary.
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::yes, i sorta am weird and enjoy pain.
Djuki 3::you would rather feel the stabs and bleed out? drowning takes like 2 minutes and then thats it
koke003::Stabbed
Djuki 3::i think drown
Kobe is too old::Kobe's rings:  2000: Thanks refs for screwing Portland 2001: Thanks Shaq 2002: Thanks refs for screwing Sacramento 2009: Thanks Pau 2010: Thanks refs for screwing Boston
RunTheBall22_-_::if your goin to say Kobe had to much help you have to say the same for Lebron. he Never won without the help of two superstars while Kobe won two without shaq. and don't give me the Gasol is great thing because all you heard at that time was he was to soft.
RunTheBall22_-_::so now they were injured? how do you think they ended up in the finals? because everyone got injured, they played one good team in the playoffs and that was the thunder. joke of a title. call me when Lebron gets three and then we can start to talk
Kobe is too old::cbbaseball19 - Almost 19 PPG 12 RPG 3 BPG.  Carried Kobe!  60% FG.  Meanwhile, Kobe was shooting 33% and a few assists and hitting 0 clutch shots.
Kobe is too old::Everyone knows that Finals was rigged. The refs won that year, not the Heat. Wade played amazing, but that was with the ref help not only getting him the calls, but letting the series even last more than 5 games.
cbbaseball19::Almost 19 PPG 12 RPG 3 BPG.  Carried Kobe!
Kobe is too old::Kobe had the best PF, second best C, defense specialist Artest, and clutch Fisher on his team the two years he won rings 'without Shaq'.  Meanwhile, LeBron had an injured Wade, injured Bosh, and d-leaguers.
RunTheBall22_-_::Wade won without Lebron and you think they would have been no where without Lebron. Wade was a champion before Lebron and Lebron never won a thing before Wade. Kobe won without Shaq. case closed
RunTheBall22_-_::Gasol is just amazing when trying to discredit kobe. loll. you guys trying to lump Gasol and Shaq together. lol
Kobe is too old::Comparing an injured Wade and Bosh to the most dominant player of all time and then a team that would have won 55+ without Kobe...wow.  The Heat would have been nowhere without James.  On the other hand, Kobe wasn't even the best shooting guard during the 3 peat.
Djuki 3::the hate is strong with this one
cbbaseball19::Gasol carried Kobe on his back that year
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::lets play would you rather
koke003::Ok
Djuki 3::i'm in
Djuki 3::haha no it's your game
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::ok start us up
cbbaseball19::Id rather not
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Alright Folks and Gals i'm outta here... Go ____ !!!
koke003::Later troll
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::heat!
Djuki 3::take care and  HEATZ!
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::why is this bulls tool here anyways
cbbaseball19::Still have an hour and fifteen minutes to go................
Djuki 3::haha, i'm already home :)
Djuki 3::haha later
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Ohh mr. IT Virtual Private network.. LOL see ya man
Djuki 3::VPN on the laptop
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::sure you are... :)
Djuki 3::i'm working from home =/
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::you have no life Duro... LOL
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::butthole
RunTheBall22_-_::down 0-2, and down 15 in game 3, Miami won four straight against the Mavs, THAT is the biggest Finals choke job. Learn your history. --- miamifan2004 when i said Lebron had the biggest choke job ever against the Mavs why would you bring up when Wade went off and the heat won? i know you want to prove me wrong but Lebron was not on that team. sorry i think you might need the history lesson
Djuki 3::how did you like Jordan's Wade-esque performances in the finals?
RunTheBall22_-_::Wade was awesome in that finals. dude went off and you have to respect that
Djuki 3::lol shush, i'm messing with him
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Sorry Duro.. Jordan and Wade should NEVER, I MEAN NEVER be on the same sentence.
Kobe is too old::I was wondering the same...  but the fact of the matter is, what LeBron dd last year against Boston and then the Thunder is far more dominating than anything Kobe's ever done in the playoffs.  Fact. Deal with it bro.
Kobe is too old::LeBron has always beaten Durant.  And strong biased. Two of those games the refs let Durant get away with calls that would have put him on the bench in the first quarter, yet LeBron haters say they were helping the HEAT?! If the refs were helping, don't you think they would have made it a seven game series instead of LeBron beating them in 5?
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::yes... it was............. but I know you won't agree so i won't argue, it is what it is..*****
koke003::4-1 is a joke of officiating?
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Boston I agree... Thunder that was a joke of officiating.  But I will give LBJ props for the Boston series
MiamiFan2004::Seriously, you guys don't know Pepe Billete?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRQ41yvToKA
Kobe is too old::I love Kobe.
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::wtf is a meme?
Kobe is too old::A joke.  Example: Kobe shooting above 45% in a season or above 40% in a Finals series.
loochey03::miami 1     chicago 2  indiana 3,   no other east teams can win. Most likely Miami..., new york not enough D and brooklyn no playoff experience
loochey03::could be
koke003::Knicks &gt; Pacers
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Brooklyn Nets are on the rise, Pacers are doing great (number 1 on Defense),  Bulls have been under the radar yet what they are doing is incredible without their main guy on the floor and sometimes with other main players out.  Boston always have a great run during the 2nd season and post.  Miami is great, but don't just look at what LBJ is doing, these other teams out there are for real.
Kobe is too old::The Heat already beat the Thunder this year, and Wade has started playing much better.  They are also looking for some bigs for the bench, and got Birdman a few days ago. He's a good pickup  if he's even half of what he was on Denver off the bench.
koke003::Dumb, that can apply to any team in the league
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Wade has started playing better but everyone still have half a season yet to go.  Just hope they all stay healthy because if one of your main guys is down you'll have disappointing loss the any of the teams above.
koke003::Pacers are also last in offense
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Miami is last or almost last on RPG yet they still have a good unit.
cbbaseball19::Pacers number 1 in your heart*
cbbaseball19::Two happy faces in one sentence, thats a little ho.mo dont ya think?
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::keep thinking that...  :)  fine by me :)
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::lebron better step it up this year.......  anything less than mvp of allstar game, regular season and finals is a failure  ;)
RunTheBall22_-_::better sign some more stars if you want that
Kobe is too old::What's funny is that's what is expected from him since averaging a near triple double on 55% FG happens every night he plays.
cbbaseball19::Kobe is too old I know, Rose can't even English. 48 Seconds Ago · Like · Quote · Flag --------- What a dummy! Get this guy Alycia!!
Kobe is too old::^^^  lololol
cbbaseball19::You're welcome! ;)
Kobe is too old::You guys may want to pick up on your memes before you call others idiots.  Just a thought...
cbbaseball19::Who wastes their time looking at memes?  Aint nobody got time for dat!
Aicyla22::haha ill give him a break just this once, i like his username
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::After the 2nd half of the season, Heat will drop to number 3.  Not trolling or hating.. but just observing and the Heat is not the same team they were last year.  (They were better).
Heat Fan Since 1866::Same with LeBron. He is averaging .3 less steals this year than last, what a bum.
Heat Fan Since 1866::Yep. The exact same Heat team except Juwan Howard, Terrel Harris, and Ronnie Turiaf being replaced by Rashard Lewis, Ray Allen, and Chris Andersen, is somehow worse than the team from 6 months ago.
Aicyla22::wade is washed up now, brings the team down big time, he should retire
loochey03::miami 1     chicago 2  indiana 3,   no other east teams can win. Most likely Miami
Aicyla22::you dont even watch a lot of their games
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::I watch plenty.. and not only 1 team............
Kobe is too old::You are a Knicks fan.  So you haven't been right about anything for 15+ years.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::ha ha... you are clueless....
Aicyla22::hes a phony
cbbaseball19::Dumb
koke003::Pacers suck man
MiamiFan2004::*men, it is plural.
cbbaseball19::I agree
cbbaseball19::Top 5 Teams In East  1. Miami Heat 2. El Heat 3. Heatz Naition 4. Heatles 5. Mijami Heat
MiamiFan2004::You guys have SEEN Pepe Billete, right?
Aicyla22::oh i like #5, very creative and realistic
RunTheBall22_-_::he only does this because he can't think of another team.
cbbaseball19::Dont be mad your team didnt make the list
koke003::I got a tip for ya. Go RunTheBall into the street. Follow it and get hit by a car.
GaspoMinnyFan981::Heatz nation &gt; El heat
cbbaseball19::Ill have to reevaluate then
GaspoMinnyFan981::Yep

koke003::I liked his comment d-bag
Aicyla22::i liked his post
Kobe is too old::lol at Djuki posting and instantly liking his own post over and over.   Lonely much?
Kobe is too old::Kobe: 17 years with Lakers, 2 FMVP Shaq: 7 years with Lakers, 3 FMVP  And after this season,  LeBron: 3 years with Miami, 2 FMVP.
Kobe is too old::Kobe has 2 FMVP....LeBron is only a few months away from catching up while playing 7 less seasons lol.
RunTheBall22_-_::only 1-3 in the finals with the all time biggest choke job. wouldn't book it just yet
MiamiFan2004::RunTheBall22_-_ - only 1-3 in the finals with the all time biggest choke job. wouldn't book it just yet  1. 1-2, not 1-3.  Learn your math. 2. down 0-2, and down 15 in game 3, Miami won four straight against the Mavs, THAT is the biggest Finals choke job.  Learn your history. 3. He is talking about duing his time in MIAMI, fool, so that would be 1-1 in two appearances.  Learn to read.
RunTheBall22_-_::we all saw what Lebron did, or should i say didn't do against the Mavs. he will never catch Kobe
Kobe is too old::Funny, Kobe's career Finals FG% is 40%.  So LeBron is the choke artist? Weird how Kobe has never been the one that made the important shots in the Finals.   brb, Shaq, Horry, Gasol, Artest, Fisher. Notice Kobe's name isn't listed in big shots in the Finals.
Djuki 3::top 5 teams in the East revised*  1. Miami 2. Heatz 3. Miami Heatz 4. Irrelevant 5. Even more irrelevant
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Duro.. at least put a realistic list if you want to post something.
Djuki 3::haha sorry i don't feel like posting anything remotely serious today
koke003::Excellent list chap
Djuki 3:::)
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Name the top 5 teams in the East  and West:  1. Pacers 2. Brooklyn 3. Miami 4. Bulls 5. Knicks  West:  1. Clips 2. Thunder 3. Warriors 4. Spurs 5. Who cares
MiamiFan2004::Miami . . . . four other victims.
RunTheBall22_-_::Knicks, Miami, Pacers,  Bulls, Bucks
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::yeah.. they are not bad... but I don't know about number 1 or 2 though.
RunTheBall22_-_::Knicks can ball.
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::you have Knicks at 1????  What?
MiamiFan2004::That's more jumbled than alycia's dock in words with friends.
koke003::Flagged
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::Flagged is not a team....
