Haven::This is what the Knicks needed, a fresh new lineup in there, Melo seriously needed to clear his head. But why in Gods name does Smith play so much? Wow, he finally hit a pretty clutch shot, he owed us that much
L.E.S. the lower::7 rebounds,5 assists,3 steals,a big time block,give credit where credit is due.2 crucial turnovers at the end,but never relinquished the lead.Yet still found Schumpert open at the most critical time of the game. And what a smile,priceless.....
Commenter::Mavs continue to play like #$%$ and yet somehow cut it to 10. One good quarter might do it.
Jono::Is it just me or is Kenyon Martin one of the best 10 players in history? I think easily, what a champion.
willie::I thought after LeBron won his first ring that Melo would change his game and become more unselfish..Guess i was wrong and thats why the Knicks struggle!!  Let him test free agency so we can start from scratch and build around Shump and Hardaway.
Haven::LOL lets just take out all the players except Melo and let his SelfishAss play all 5 positions. The ball goes right to him and stays there for multiple turnovers in a row. Guy is such a selfish loser in the 2nd half. he gets worse and worse as the game goes on always. You'll never see a thriving Melo come the 4th qrt
Haven::Shumpert is playin the way we expected he would this year. And Kenyon Martin, my man is still going strong and one hell of a player. Hes so important to the Knicks and hardly gets the credit he deserves
Jawo::if the mavs can win 4 straight on the road, why can't they do the same at home?
Rich D::Is Tyson OK, 4 minutes and out is strange ???
