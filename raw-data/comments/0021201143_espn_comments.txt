845chase::Good game Hawks,
Token A-Town Sports Fan::Hawks without 4 starters, rookie puts up best performance on team, and they lose by 2. so of course espn's headline is Tim Duncan Carries Shorthanded Spurs
RYNO-LASCAVIO::After watching the game and reading the title of this article I could help but wonder if these reporters are really watching the games. Hawks basically had their entire starting line-up on the bench but its the Spurs who are the "David" in this Goliath story. What an absolute joke!
RespectThaGame::Because that's exactly what he did.
ryuhern75::GO SPURS GO!!!!!
damann88::So, Atlanta sat 4 of its to 5 scorers.  Remind me why they weren't fined by the NBA? F U Stern!
AtlSmith1024::Didn't the Spurs send Duncan, Manu, and Parker home for "rest".  Seems a different situation to me.
SwaffMan::Yeah, injured...just like Duncan, Manu, Green, Parker, LeBron, Wade and Chalmers.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Injured. :-)
I hate Jerry Jones::You know the REAL reason Duncan is better than Kobe? Because Duncan took a franchise that's never been good and was a fixture that made them one of the league's perennial contenders for more than a decade. And because Duncan never ran his mouth, alienating teammates and dismantling great teams in the middle of dynastic runs of championships. Yeah, Shaq is also a pain who needs to shut up more often, but if just one of them could have been a little more humble and a lot less selfish, the Lakers would have challenged the Bulls of the '90s as the greatest team of all time. But they couldn't, so they won't. The fact that Duncan isn't a divisive d-bag is what makes him a greater player than Kobe, since all other things are fairly equal.... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  And the award for FACTOIDS of the night goes to.....this post.  Well done.
RYNO-LASCAVIO::Good post. Kobe is a blow-hard who dont know when to leave well enough alone.
SwaffMan::You stole my post! lol
DOOMZ DAYZ::A humble Laker? No such thing, we are talking about CALIFORNIA!
FeFyeFoeRun::This is exactly why San Antonio is Gone in Rd 1! Life and death in EVERY game they play! Enjoy getting knocked out by Houston!  <b>Heat Vs Doesnt Matter  NBA FINALS!</b>
SwaffMan::There's no way that Houston beats San Antonio in the first round. The reason they are #7/8 despite looking SO good at times is that they live and die with the 3. No post game, no defense. That doesn't survive a series, especially against a team as talented and well-coached as the Spurs. They win their first round easily, like last year. I'm just not sure about after that...
DOOMZ DAYZ::Lol
DOOMZ DAYZ::I'd rather "enjoy" your mom!
E Pluribis Unum::No you wouldn't, she just lays there!
SwaffMan::LOL...I'm a Spurs fan but I LOVE this ESPN headline. Duncan carries short-handed Spurs over Hawks? The Hawks were missing Korver, Smith, Horford and Harris. They only had one true starter on the floor. The Hawks' starting 5 tonight average 17.2 minutes per game. LOL. Talk about short-handed. HOW did the Spurs just barely win this game? They are struggling. I know that Parker and Ginobili being out hurts, but I'm very concerned by what I've seen from them in the last 7 or 8 games. They are not looking like a playoff team right now.
AtlSmith1024::I hear you man.  While the headline is technically true, it is a bit misleading.
SwaffMan::.
Jdan524g::i read that headline and was so confused haha
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Thank you, someone talking with some sense, as I pointed out last night that headline is comedy at it's finest. Short handed Spurs over Hawks when the Hawks basically played the end of their bench themselves.
NASH_10::don't give up the #1 seed, Timmy! We'd love to see you in the playoffs, for old times sake. You and Kobe in your twilight years, both ballin. Looking forward to a great series :)
Walter White A.K.A. Heisenberg::Dang wish I could have seen this game John Jenkins went off 23 points 4 boards and 4 dimes   Way to rep VU and good luck to him and Festus in the playoffs   also Bobcats please trade Jeff Taylor next season I hate watching him lose on that joke of a franchise
prismc::SPurs will get to 60 wins and have the bench play the last 2 games  OKC probably gets 61 wins for the season, doesn't matter either way, health &gt; best record when it pertains to the SPurs
CU11mdupnic::duncan is the best big man in the league...period
howdythur::best player of the last decade plus
June 24th Is STILL Kobe Bryant Day::Geesus Timmy, did I accidentally take a time warp back to 2003?
chocolate__giddyup::Goodnight Spurs fans. I know you have to get up early to milk the chickens and stuff. To the Celts fan, see you in 10 years or so. When you're relevant again.
prismc::LOL with Dwight leaving in the offseason for the Nets or Dallas. Kobe AND Nash retiring in the next 2 years the Lakers are left to build around Ron Artest, Pau Gasol, Jodi Meeks, Steve Blake and D'Antoni LOOOLOLLOLOLOOLOOOLLOLLOLLOL Stern might as well just fold up this franchise haha
Spurz2013champs::Good night. You must be tired from the beat down you been taking on this board
SultanOfSludge211::*FACE-PALM*  Good riddance, Kobe Stan.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Well GL Spurs. The C's want Kiwi.
howdythur::Kawhi and they wont get him
Spurz2013champs::Kiwi?
Spurz2013champs::Can Kobetards defend the fact that Kobe wasn't even the #1 player on the team for a couple of championships?? Duncan was always Spurs best player
SultanOfSludge211::Duncan was the best player during that playoff run, still attracting all the double-teams so Parker and Ginobili could run wild on the perimeter.
chocolate__giddyup::Except when TP won finals MVP. Oops...
Spurz2013champs::oops?? Tim Duncan was the best player that whole year minus that Final series. And even that was debatable. Oops on you fool
SultanOfSludge211::Nope. Those idiots think Kobe was better than Shaq.
Spurz2013champs::Really? no way. Wow Kobetards are more idiotic than I thought
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Idiot Kobetards. It's unfathomable.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Pippen is to Jordan as Kobe is to Shaq
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Except Pippen did more.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Pippen didn't have Joey Crawford in his pocket thanks to Buss.
chocolate__giddyup::Yep. Because Pippen won 2 titles without MJ
Tiago Splitter::REASON WHY KOBE BRICK BRYANT WILL PASS MJ IN SCORING:  -Jordan did 4yrs in college -Kobe joined NBA straight out of HS -Jordan retired in prime for 2yrs -Jordan passed the ball -Kobe has more free throws -Kobe ballhogs
SultanOfSludge211::You were running your mouth about how he was gonna pass him in scoring, without providing any context.
chocolate__giddyup::Will he be the #3 all time scorer? Of course he will. That's not a knock on MJ or saying it makes Kobe better than MJ. Just a fact.
SultanOfSludge211::Kobe has played in 161 more games than MJ, and he's STILL 809 points, 123 rebounds, 230 blocks, and 704 steals behind him.  LMFAO! Kobe isn't even CLOSE to MJ in stature.
chocolate__giddyup::Did anybody here say he was?
Spurz2013champs::-FACTS
Spurz2013champs::why you slurping so hard on Kobe, chocolate??
chocolate__giddyup::I'm not even a Laker fan. Just stumbled into this Kobe vs Duncan debate. It's not really close when it's made outside of Texas.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::You're right: it's not close. Most people think Timmy is the better player all time.
SultanOfSludge211::Nope. If you ask anyone outside of delusional Laker nation, it's Duncan 9 times out of 10.  Anyone that understands basketball will comprehend this, which obviously precludes you, since you're a Kobe Stan.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Because he wants to support Westbrick's horrible numbers.
SultanOfSludge211::Because he's a pathetic Kobetard; that's what Kobetards do.
Spurz2013champs::oh yeah, my bad
chocolate__giddyup::Win Kobe retires with at least 5 rings and the #3 all time scorer, this argument will be even more ridiculous.
SwaffMan::You know the REAL reason Duncan is better than Kobe? Because Duncan took a franchise that's never been good and was a fixture that made them one of the league's perennial contenders for more than a decade. And because Duncan never ran his mouth, alienating teammates and dismantling great teams in the middle of dynastic runs of championships. Yeah, Shaq is also a pain who needs to shut up more often, but if just one of them could have been a little more humble and a lot less selfish, the Lakers would have challenged the Bulls of the '90s as the greatest team of all time. But they couldn't, so they won't. The fact that Duncan isn't a divisive d-bag is what makes him a greater player than Kobe, since all other things are fairly equal.
SultanOfSludge211::When you count regular season and playoffs, Kobe is already the all-time leader in bricks.  If you just count regular season, he's 177 away from snatching Havlicek's all-time record.  So he does have that going for him.
prismc::Hondo was known for his defense, not offense
chocolate__giddyup::Yeah. Havlicek is terrible.
Spurz2013champs::talk about things nobody cares about. Kobe is so 5 years ago bro
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Kobe has missed more shots than anyone in the history of the game. That's a ridiculous fact.
chocolate__giddyup::If he constantly played on losing teams, you might have a point.
chocolate__giddyup::If he took all those shots and constantly played on losing teams, you might have a point.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::I think you're missing the point here buddy.
chocolate__giddyup::And scored more than everybody but 2.
Spurz2013champs::ownage
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Because he took twice as many shots.
chocolate__giddyup::But he'll have scored more than everybody but 2. In history.
Spurz2013champs::Still want to know if the game was as close as the score says
Tiago Splitter::We were up 10 the whole time, then the they gave up but the dumb ref called a foul when a Hawk player was shooting from halfcourt with .6 sec left  Spurs looked good
chocolate__giddyup::Nobody cares. Couldn't even recognize most of the players.
Spurz2013champs::you calling me  nobody??
SultanOfSludge211::"Laker$ vs Laker$.... I'd be lying if I told you there wasn't a special fascination with the Laker$"  - David $tern, when asked about his "dream Finals match-up"  Yeah, David $tern doesn't favor the Laker$, right?
I hate Jerry Jones::David Stern is a major tool.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Lakers fans are acting like Knicks fans this year: Arrogant fools who will be gone after round one.
vman606::well, my job here is done. hope ya'll wrote some of this stuff down. see you next time school is in session.   go lakers.
SultanOfSludge211::Speaking of choking:  Kobe's conversion-rate in game-winning or game-tying shots in the playoffs is 7-for-28(25%).  How clutch!!!
vman606::awwww.. you're crying, aren't you? you're really upset about this i see... i'm sorry.
SultanOfSludge211::Laker$ 2013 playoff conspiracy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MhmGyZ7KF0&amp;lc=WF5_KLZEMksUBZduiH_2I0BWGt8cuAhJBnwNyony-YU
SultanOfSludge211::Yeah, they'd be about 20 games under .500 if not for all the slanted-officiating.  You dudes can't acknowledge this, and that's why I can't take you seriously.
vman606::yes, the video is narrated by bill simmons, infamous laker hater/celtic fan.. so you know it's objective.
vman606::yes, the refs have helped the lakers all year. that's why the lakers are a whopping 4 games over .500.
SultanOfSludge211::He narrates the first 30 seconds or so of it, and that video only shows about 2% of the rig-jobs the ref$ have pulled off for the sorry a$$ Laker$ this year.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::It's true.
vman606::as a laker fan, i say bring on the spurs. kobe usually gets the better of timmy (big surprise) come playoff time. oh, and the last time the spurs didn't choke in the playoffs was in 07 -- when most of america had no idea who the hell barack obama was.
SultanOfSludge211::Yeah, thanks to an all-time fluke performance from Ibaka and Perkins in game 4. They must have sold their mothers' souls to the devil for that one.
SultanOfSludge211::Didn't the Laker$ choke away games 2 and 4 against the Thunder last year? Is that NOT choking? Man, you idiots have some selective memories.
vman606::the lakers were the lower seed. spurs had homecourt and a 2-0 lead and gagged as usual.
airicad::It seems like Leonard and Duncan are the only two Spurs who are actually playing decent basketball right now.  It probably has something to do with the fact that there's no real floor general to control the offense with Parker and Ginobili out.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::One thing Duncan and Kobe share in common as of now and that's both will see the trophy hoisted by that team in Miami for years to come, sorry.
vman606::spurs fans should be confident. i mean, SAS would never lose to an 8 seed in the playoffs. perish the thought!
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::I bet you were confident in August....
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::You're not winning the title this year.
vman606::how is it delusional? the spurs choke every year.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::That's referred to as delusional in the DSM-IV
vman606::still am, thanks.
SultanOfSludge211::Dominant big men have a much greater affect on the game than volume-scoring guards;  this is a well-known fact of NBA history.  MJ was the only guard in NBA history to lead his team to multiple championships without the aid of a dominant big man, so he's the lone exception, which is one reason why he's the GOAT.  You Kobe Stanley's can't make ANY logical arguments as to why Kobe is greater than Duncan other than your stand-by '5 rings!!' platitudes. You guys got NOTHING.
SultanOfSludge211::What a retort! But I never expected anything more from a lobotomized Kobetard like yourself.
chocolate__giddyup::Kareem didn't even play when Magic won his 1st and he was far from dominant at the end of his career.
SultanOfSludge211::Kareem was the best player in that series, and should have won Finals MVP.  But yes, Magic was a BOSS. He could lead nearly any team to massive amounts of success.
vman606::you are the one with nothing my friend. go to bed. those cows aren't gonna milk themselves in the morning, you know.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::2020 30 for 30: 6-24: Overrated
SultanOfSludge211::21-to-4 FT's in the 4th-quarter is conjecture? Man, you clowns are delusional.
SultanOfSludge211::Yeah, by "defending" Rondo and standing on the weak-side doing nothing, and not even having to box anyone out for those rebounds.  If not for the ref$, the Laker$ would have lost that game, FACT.
chocolate__giddyup::That's another sign of when your argument is failing. The old "let's blame the refs" excuse.
vman606::conjecture.
chocolate__giddyup::Didn't he out rebound every player on the Celtic front line in that game?
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::You don't make any sense.
chocolate__giddyup::Oh. Celts fan. You're almost as irrelevant as Hawks fan.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Probably. So would Barea. We are the worst rebounding team in history.
chocolate__giddyup::I hate being put in the position of defending Kobe but Spurs fan is just so myopic. You rarely see any non-spurs fan trying to make this argument. The more apt discussion is Duncan/Malone/Barkley. Kobe's career accomplishments put him above this discussion.
chocolate__giddyup::Maybe if Duncan ever defended a title he could make the argument a little bit closer.
vman606::not even close to being true. nice try, though.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::There is no argument amongst anyone other than yourself. Timmy owns Kobe.
vman606::without question. you are a wise man.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Are you crazy?   Duncan owns Kobe and it's not even close.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Shaq and Timmy
vman606::lol. who owns who come playoff time?
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::Come to Boston Josh. You can too Kiwi.
Sports junkies rule and news hounds suck.::As many of you know,I have posted the message "Spurs fans suck." many times. So why do I ahte the Spurs? Because my Phoenix Suns got SCREWED in 2007. That Amare suspension was totally unfair and unwarranted and it cost the Suns the key game of that series,game 5. It was totally unfair and unwarranted and it may well have cost the Suns the 2007 NBA Championship. It definitely cost the Suns the 2007 Western Confrence Championship at the very least. After the tragedy of 2007,being a Suns fan gives me no choice but to hate the Spurs.
UK_Basketball_for_Life752::You got much older. Spurs got you stressed?
SultanOfSludge211::2000 NBA Finals:    Kobe = 78 pts on 33-90(.367%) in 176 minutes in; 78 pts, 57 bricks.    Croshere = 91 pts on 24-44(.545%) in 145 minutes; 91 pts, 20 bricks.   And Kobe is supposed to be better than Duncan?? LMMFAO!!!!
SultanOfSludge211::1. Chroshere was a BUM.  2. I thought Kobe was an "unstoppable warrior who played through all injuries"?  3. Duncan led the Spurs to the championship in 2005 on not one, but TWO bad ankles.  No excuses, princess.
SultanOfSludge211::vman606 - wrong.. again.  Is that all you got? Wrong about WHAT?
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Croshere was hardly a bum and especially doing that time when Indiana was good enough to make the Finals.
vman606::wrong.. again.
chocolate__giddyup::How many did Timmy get in the finals that year?
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::silly sample size and if I remember correctly back in that particular era Austin Croshere was really really balling for Indiana.
vman606::and he had a severe ankle injury that series. typical hater, telling only half the story.
SultanOfSludge211::The 1 year Kobe actually won MVP, CP3 had a whopping FOUR more win-shares than him! Kobe is BY FAR the most overrated player in NBA history, and his moronic fanboys hammer home that notion EVERY DAY.
vman606::yeah, right. not even close to being true.
amtrack5::Someone needs to ask Tim where he got his time machine
vman606::the PED store. it's in the mall right next to jamba juice.
CU11mdupnic::wow math class took over, ment PEDs obviously
CU11mdupnic::wait, so when you take PDEs, you lose weight and look slimmer?
SultanOfSludge211::vman606 awww, running out of ammo, are we? metric, shmetric. kobe owns timmy come postseason time. kobe has more titles. GAME OVER. thanks for playing.  ========================== Cousy &gt; Kobe Havlicek &gt;&gt;&gt; Kobe Sam Jones &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kobe  You really wanna play the rings game?
SultanOfSludge211::That doesn't explain anything.  And you think Duncan DIDN'T work his a$$ off to be the player he is?  That's where you Kobetards fail the most; you assume that Kobe automatically works harder than any player in the league, which is the biggest bunch of BS I've ever heard.
vman606::never said duncan didn't. kobe's rise was more impressive.
SultanOfSludge211::All 3 of those guys I mentioned are all-time greats and have more rings than Kobe.  And Kobe is supposed to be this prolific scorer, and he's only 10th all-time in playoff PPG?
vman606::that's because he didn't start right away. another reason kobe has had the more impressive career. duncan went first overall and was supposed to be great. kobe was never supposed to be anything special (13th overall pick) but worked his butt off to be great.
vman606::lol. kobe is 3rd all time in playoff scoring. the only two ahead of him are kareem and mike. don't act like he is steve kerr or something.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Silly title by the editor " Short handed Spurs beat the Hawks" . Hell, 85% of the Hawks main players didn't play, Horford, Smith, Korver, Devin Harris, Stevenson. Not to mention Zaza Pachulia and Lou Williams are out for the season. Give me a break.
chocolate__giddyup::Even people who live in Atlanta don't give a crap about the Hawks.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::cause we have thousand of people living here from other cities or states not native Atlantans.  wish they all would get a clue and realize it ain't where you from it's where your at. all of them can choke on a big one.
chocolate__giddyup::Kobe's last 2 titles are what push him ahead of Duncan. Won those with only one other all star on the squad.
SultanOfSludge211::'99 and 2003.
CU11mdupnic::see above
vman606::'99 doesnt count -- shortened season!
CU11mdupnic::youre a $@%!$@% joke gtfo
SultanOfSludge211::Has Kobe ever led a team to a championship with NO all-star teammates? Duncan has, TWICE.
CU11mdupnic::and change the subject so you dont look like an idiot
vman606::not even close. who won the MVP of the last spurs' title? you know, the last time they DIDN'T choke in the playoffs...?
CU11mdupnic::im sorry, were the playoffs condensed too? than youre argument makes zero sense
SultanOfSludge211::vman606 - tony parker has been the best player on the spurs for at least the last 5 seasons. and timmy's first ring was in a 50 game season, so that doesn't count. see, i can do that, too.  Wrong. Parker has been the best player for the last 2 years, and now Duncan is taking it back.
vman606::tony parker has been the best player on the spurs for at least the last 5 seasons. and timmy's first ring was in a 50 game season, so that doesn't count. see, i can do that, too.
SultanOfSludge211::And the ref$ rigged that series in 2010, so that doesn't even count.
vman606::lol.. when????
SultanOfSludge211::vman606 you can keep typing it.. but that won't make it come true.  ============================ Duncan has more MVP's; more Finals MVP's; more All-D selections(he actually EARNED his); more win-shares; more defensive win-shares, etc.  Kobe has never led the NBA in win-shares, defensive win-shares, offensive win-shares, Ortg, or Drtg.    Duncan has led the NBA in win-shares twice, defensive win-shares 5 times, offensive win-shares once, and Drtg 4 times.    Duncan &gt;&gt;&gt; Kobe
chocolate__giddyup::When guys start relying on so-called advance metrics, that's when you know they're reaching.
vman606::seriously.
SultanOfSludge211::They're both all-time greats, but Duncan has had a more impressive career.  Nearly every advanced metric points in Duncan's favor. Good night.
vman606::awww, running out of ammo, are we? metric, shmetric. kobe owns timmy come postseason time. kobe has more titles. GAME OVER. thanks for playing.
SultanOfSludge211::Everything I stated was a fact, kid. Duncan's impact on the Spurs DWARFS Kobe's impact on the LOLaker$. That's indisputable.
vman606::sure there is -- plenty. more rings, points, playoff points. and who usually beats who in the postseason, when it counts the most???
vman606::if you are insinuating that kobe didn't earn some of his accolades, that is NOT a fact. it is purely your opinion, kiddo. you're entitled to it of course.. but it is conjecture nonetheless. all that being said, duncan is an all time great player.
SultanOfSludge211::Spurs with Duncan: 841-335(.716%); without Duncan: 45-37(.549%) Laker$ with Kobe: 808-427(.653%); without Kobe: 65-39(.625%)  Duncan: +16.7 win% added Kobe: +2.8 win% added  There's nothing you can say to put Kobe higher than Duncan on an all-time scale. Get over it.
vman606::wrong.. again. nice try though. "he actually EARNED his" is a hilarious touch. so which awards are the ones that have not been earned -- let me guess, only kobe's, right? HAHA. good thing you're staying objective.
chocolate__giddyup::Tim Duncan has been class on &amp; off the court his entire career. He's probably the best PF of all time (even though he actually plays center). But very few objective observers will ever rate him over Kobe Bryant. And that's not a knock against TD, just an honest evaluation of KB.
theheebs::I don't think kobe has even had a better career.  he sure has had a good one, but i think you need to take a more serious look at the career duncan has had.  just because he is quiet and humble doesn't mean isn't one of the best.  If I had to put together a GOAT nba team, Tim is the starting PF for that team.  kobe doesn't make my team.  I'd rather have Reggie miller backing up MJ at the SG position that kobe.
SultanOfSludge211::Wrong. 90% of objective observes rank TD over Kobe. Only ignorant Kobe Stan's think otherwise.  Dominant big men affect the game in ways that guards not named Jordan or Magic can.  It's a fact of basketball that goes back a half-century.
vman606::they're right. duncan is all time, but kobe has had the better career.
vman606::that's not even close to being true. where are you getting your info from -- the spurs website? LOL.
chocolate__giddyup::Of the comprehensive lists I've seen ranking the top players of all time, the ones ranking Kobe over Duncan are about 4 to 1.
vman606::duncan is amazing, no question.. but you're right -- he is not a pure PF. karl malone, for my money is the best pure PF ever.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::I love the fight and effort of the Hawks in this game, I wish they would bottle that.
Spurz2013champs::wth, i didn't get to watch tonights game. Why the hell are we only beating the Squawks by 2???
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::your right, but I'm thinking of 85-89 seasons when your teams were so bad that the league was possibly considering relocating the Spurs. But then came David
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::I can remember a time when your Spurs were one of the sorriest teams in the league consistently. Then Got pretty good , and eventually tanked the year Tim Duncan graduated and got the 1st pick. Get over yourself cause the Duncan era is winding slowly but surely down and then what? Back to being and also ran.
SultanOfSludge211::The Spurs have only missed the playoffs 4 times in franchise history, so they've never been a sorry team for any decent stretch of years.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Hawks have made the playoffs for the 6th year in a row, hardly garbage as they come. Your thinking more on the lines of a Toronto, Charlotte, Cleveland, Phoenix, Sacramento and etc, etc.....
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::The Hawks didn't even play Horford or Josh Smith or Korver. So basically the Spurs bench plus Duncan beat the Hawks bench. So get over yourself already.
Spurz2013champs::still, its the Squawks. About as garbage of a team as they come
tomBabauts::Duncan &gt; Kobe
SultanOfSludge211::vman606 is a Kobe fanboy, so don't take him seriously.
vman606::you can keep typing it.. but that won't make it come true.
SultanOfSludge211::And yes: Duncan &gt;&gt;&gt; Kobe
vman606::duncan has been amazing.   but, come on now.
vman606::TWex2120 - Come on what? He has more mvps more finals mvps 4 rings and is 10x the teammate and person kobe is.  yes, i am sure you know both of them personally. kobe has more rings, points and playoff points. kobe's lakers have beaten duncan's spurs most of the time when the two have met in the postseason.
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::TWex2120 - Come on what? He has more mvps more finals mvps 4 rings and is 10x the teammate and person kobe is.   cause you know them personally right? Lmao
TWex2120::Come on what? He has more mvps more finals mvps 4 rings and is 10x the teammate and person kobe is.
John 3663::Valiant effort by the hawks though...
Cowboys N Spurs Dynasty::Spurs about to make the playoffs for the 17th time in a row  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_franchise_post-season_streaks
John 3663::Do Atlanta Hawks' fans exist?
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Yes!
theheebs::I really hope the spurs win it this year.  It would be a shame to waste the MONSTER season duncan is having.  He is just such an incredible player.  also, probably the classiest guy in the NBA.
TWex2120::Vman name a team in the past 10 years that has had significant injuries to their star players and won a championship
