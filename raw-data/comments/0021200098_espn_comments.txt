redsoxnut20::the bulls suck
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Rondo is starting to feel more comfortable, you say? I like the sound of that. Go CELTICS.
Road dog Red::Bacon, eggs and cream of wheat.. the breakfast of champions.. aka Boston Celtics fans
_I Am A Celtic_::Hi
Road dog Red::CheapTown fans.... get a clue and boycott Reinsdorf
TomekiaAllen::Carlos is playing very soft. We reall y do need D.Rose I think the Bulls will have to trade to get D.Rose some help before he comes back after next year. Carlos is a waste of time big and sorry what a waste. We will be the #2 seeded. Go Bulls
angelgr89::Lol #2 seed? U do realize Rose won't be back for a while
11marqysandias1964::Smiled every time reading an article about Lakers new coach when speaking of "greatest coach ever" to return. Didn't happen as everyone knows, but that is apparently his title. So not true. Many coaches better. One of them active and that is Doc Rivers. He has guys playing that use walkers to get up and down the court. The talk started five years ago that they, Celtics, too old... yet year and year out this guy Rivers has them playing at high level and in the mix.
RunTheRock22...::talk to me when Doc gets some more rings. lol
kahl1212::its easy to own rings when your team is stacked with all-stars the way Jacksons have always been
beantownin09::please correct article Deng missed those two FT's in the final minute to cut it to three, Taj got the rebound after the second miss....
stepliz1984::One of the biggest things that I see is Rondo is finally showing some consistency in his jump shot. That was a major knock that people in the league had against him. Other teams will have to take notice or pay like Nate did by constantly going under his screens. The beauty of it is that Rondo is a pass first guard, but if he needs to shoot he will and is becoming very capable.
Excelscior1::@Stepliz1984  Rondo could always shoot the past 3 seasons. The REAL knock by people who follow the team and his teammate, was that he didn't shoot enough. Doc has begged him to be more aggressive and selfish the past several years (except a big game or playoffs, which he does naturally).
JustDeeej::He is shooting better than 50% this year.  So far averaging 14.7 ppg, 12.7 assists.
Dumb Heat fans::seems wrong - he finally hit some last night, but the 55% at the ft line tells the story
jdelgado903::boozer playing soft. heinrich showing he can't stay healthy, no one is productive off the bench even with the big minutes they received. other than deng, who played 45 mins, nobody is stepping up. joakim isn't consistent. boozer is just as big as noah, but yet he was out rebounded by 7 last night. deng even had more rebounds than boozer. he isn't worthy of the big contract. but defensively, they still can shut it down. despite the fact that they were up against a PG that averages nearly a triple-double every game, the bulls had a decent night when it comes to defensive rebounding. just no performers to put up a W.
wchughes95::I almost feel like the Bulls are finding ways to lose games now.
LashLaroo4You::Heat will DESTROY BOTH of these LOSERS in the Playoffs! DESTROY!
01Bulls4life::Hhhm... Bulls losses are by less than 10 (not blow outs).  Bulls are expected to lose without their most important piece on the floor yet they are competing hard and wining most of their games and I repeat again, without their most important piece on the floor.  You sir are an insecure Troll.  Last I checked Heat losses have been blowouts and they have the 3 clowns playing all these games.  Celtics and Bulls have a GREAT GREAT shot at this Heat team.  So keep trolling and keep thinking the Heat are unbeatable...
Dumb Heat fans::LashLaroo is a ^
ChimeraLycan::it's okay. i hear the fear in your words LashLaroo4You.
GLaps17::I can see why you would think that, considering how badly the Heat beat the Celtics last year in the playoffs.  What? It went to 7 games and was a very close series? Interesting...
_I Am A Celtic_::<b>C's!!</b>
BuckeyeNation36::Celtics look better than the last couple of years. Far more depth to go with the aging stars. Balance the minutes and they can be a factor, little question.
Road dog Red::Tics costed and stiil wn
_I Am A Celtic_::Chill out dude
Road dog Red::Stacy King and dennis rodman COME ON DOQWN
Road dog Red::whupping up on chic ago in Chicago... lol... Wheres Luc Longley when ya need him.... lol lol
Road dog Red::The Bobcats will end up with a better record then da Bulls. thanx Jerry
Road dog Red::Nate Robinson...starting point guard..... you gotta be kidding me
Road dog Red::Reinsdorf will have a Bulls in the Lottery grab bag for like the 12th time is 16 years LMAO you spineless hens wont say a peep LMAO
Road dog Red::CheapTown fans.. can you spell L.O.T.T.E.R.Y.
Road dog Red::Nate Robinson ... Bulls point Guard LMAO talk about getting a player on the cheap... even if out of position and selling him to the dumb fans.. Pathetic
nhraven5200::Terry is trash, all he does is launch prayer three's.
JustDeeej::he is averaging over 50% fg so far...  so he can shoot what ever he wishes.
Road dog Red::Reindorf. fill the seats so I can laugh all the way to the bank you SUCKERS
Road dog Red::Going Going GONE -Bulls chances of being a contender-
nhraven5200::And Boston has a chance??? I dont think so.
Road dog Red::CheapTown Bulls look forward to the LOTTERY
nhraven5200::Chicago has big issues.They should easily handle Boston,even without Rose.
jimmy59822::"Rondo's big night"? Wth. LeBron already had like 3 near triple doubles just this season with in a span of 4 games.  vs Denver.    20 points, 9 rebounds, 11 assists, 0 turnovers. vs Brooklyn. 20 points, 12 rebounds. 8 assists. vs Atlanta.    20 points, 11 rebounds, 9 assists.
ChimeraLycan::what's your point? God forbid someone other than James receive recognition. Rondo flirts with or actually gets a trip-dub pretty frequently. should the media shut up since it isn't James?
Shaun0088::The media wont ever shut up about Lebron LOL!The media especally ESPN hs a man crush on him.
GLaps17::And LeBron gets plenty of credit when he does that, point?
jimmy59822::No it's just another typical LeBron game.
Teletubbie2012::Considering Lebron is much bigger and more talented, its a great compliment for you to compare his numbers with Rondo and that proves that Rondo is really good
saintsrapackofcheaters::I've been using this bet system named Sportsbettingstar. I doubled my starting balance within the first month following it. you can find the system online if you search google for online betting system..
oreed is a angry redsox fan::can't wait for avery bradley AkA  ( pain in the a'ss ) to comeback
tfec2233::It's painful to see Rondo perform so well while DRose likely watches from the weight room, remembering the countless times he made him look like a D-Leaguer.  Rondo is great--Rose just does this to every elite PG to let them know their place.
oreed is a angry redsox fan::rondo fills up the stats sheet ..while rose balhog
tfec2233::also--define "some".  I can't remember a single game where Rondo outplayed Rose.  Maybe once in his rookie year.  I'm really not sure.
Excelscior1::The entire 2009 playoffs, when Rondo practically avg a triple double against Chicago. Secondly they have/had different roles on their teams. Rose, is a two guard/ball hog in  a point guards body. Rondo, had different responsibilities on his team, to do different things, do to their make up. Just be lucky, Rondo isn't as selfish as Rose (for your argument anyway).
oreed is a angry redsox fan::once? lol
tfec2233::well you're just deflecting the point--Rose is a better player.  Call him a two-guard if you want.
abdiraxman79::derrick rose is a 2 guard in a point guard's body, he's a great scorer but rondo's a better all around player and is one of the purest pg's in the league...........
JustDeeej::Some of Rondo's best games have come against Rose.
manimarf09::So Terry is starting now for the Celts?
BostonCsFTW::Sullinger shouldnt start he is a sloppy player but who isnt there rookie year he just needs to learn under KG Hall of Famer and Bass the same type body and shooting ability as Bass but sulliinger can shoot 3s Starters should be  Rondo Terry till Bradley Pierce  Bass  KG
Vjo33::yeah. And it's working. stick with it.
JustDeeej::Starts and finishes games, but is still low 20's in min/game.
Jimmy30313::Hope not. Doc is shifting the starting lineups a fair bit, Sullinger has started a couple of games
Milk Was A Bad Choice7::Good to see the Bulls at least staying competitive without Rose. http://www.milkwasabadchoice.weebly.com
manimarf09::Deng is really stepping it up.
JustDeeej::45 minutes
Milk Was A Bad Choice7::Robinson is proving to be a good pick up in rebuilding the "Bench Mob".
Jimmy30313::I miss Nate, wish he was still with the C's
Milk Was A Bad Choice7::It's nice to see the Bulls staying competitive with a new bench and without Rose. http://www.milkwasabadchoice.weebly.com
Milk Was A Bad Choice7::It's nice to see the Bulls staying competitive without Rose and almost all of the "Bench Mob". http://milkwasabadchoice.weebly.com/
POLK HIGH 33 with 4TDs in ONE GAME::Rondo is the biggest stat stuffer who's SOFT AND FILLED WITH STUFFING!
Le-Goat::damn, Rondo put up some LeBron #s
Jimmy30313::You mean Lebron put up some Rondo #s
JustDeeej::Rondo has been a near triple double nearly every game, and has a double double in every game.
Jimmy30313::I know, it was a joke. But Rondo is Mr Triple Double
manimarf09::James has been near triple double almost every game this season. Rondo only tonight.
Rondo shits on people::Rondo is a God, plain and simple. The NBA is not worthy.
STR8REBEL::Where was Boozer is the 4th? The guy is making $16 million this season and he does not play in the 4th quarter? The Bulls should amnesty him. His play has never been worth the contract he signed. The All-Star games he made should be given to Deron Williams.
van.muhle::as a Utah fan, I would hate to gloat and say that we told you so back when you signed him, but:  we told you so
Peyton Mannings Baby Jaguar::He really does blow... keep him for the duration of this year, obviously, but getting rid of him has to be at least a good possibility in the offseason
FinsCanesHeat2203 3.0::I DO NOT LIKE THE CELTICS :)
Jimmy30313::Not many people like winners
Peyton Mannings Baby Jaguar::I just found out some guy I used to know before I moved was a chick... <b>WTF<b></b></b>
Marcus -Best Punt Returner in the NFL- Sherels::????
Peyton Mannings Baby Jaguar::Well, apparently I was misinformed, it's some idiot from a TV show... but still. Humanity! STAHP
_I Am A Celtic_::Winning!
Takushiba Chan::The best at being 4-3?
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::Bulls&gt;Rockets
EpicCeltic09::BOSTON!.......YEAH WE DA BEST!!!!
EpicCeltic09::nope still wrote it right!
EpicCeltic09::you read it right
The Bat of Adam Dunn::you wrote it wrong.
InsertNameHere69::The best?
