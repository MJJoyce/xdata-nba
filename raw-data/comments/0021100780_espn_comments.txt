Sports fan for life93::That schedule is tremendous no hard teams
Denuggetz21::Both Mavs and grizz are 1.5 games up on the nuggs and have the tie breaker over them so Denver would have to win around 8-11 games out of 13 to get the 5th even 4th spot also dallas memphis and LA have pretty though scedule's which makes it more posssible  also Gallo should be back in limited action vs the Hornets
Sports fan for life93::Im not scrolling 2700 people just to find 1 I know you were. Don't be a hypocrite. You can troll us but we cant troll you. That's a hypocrite.

Denuggetz21::Peyton Manning
Denuggetz21::so the grizz play the mavs 2 times thunder heat and lakers dallas plays the grizz 2 times thunder clippers 2 times and the rockets   If Denver can win 8 more teams they can get the 6th maybe 5th seed
Denuggetz21::Denver unless they epicly collapse should make the playoffs question is what seed will they get

Sports fan for life93::The Rockets schedule is tougher than ours which is great.
Denuggetz21::any thing over 8 wins ill take
Sports fan for life93::We can positively make the playoffs with this remaining Nugget schedule
Denuggetz21::Also I think the Thunder will Rest there players for the playoffs since its 3 days before the playoffs start
Sports fan for life93::Ill say 8-5 maybe 9-4
Sports fan for life93::Being at least 500 would make my year. Anything else is Icing on the cake.

Denuggetz21::all are winnable games
Denuggetz21::10-3
