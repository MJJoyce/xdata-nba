Cyril::At this point Jeff Teague has been the best point guard in the Eastern Conference and deserves to be an All-Star starter.  But, it will probably go to Deron Williams or even Rajon Rondo since the fans are still voting.
Joseph::Jeff Teague is an amazing player, but NBA fans don't give him enough credit.
richdad59::I hope Milsap picks it up! He has not scored in double figures in 3 straight games, and his average is 17 points a game.
CSONKA_39::Teague is a fantasy bad mfer
Scott S::If you would have told me the Sixers would have as many wins as the Nets and Knicks combined by this point in the season, I would have laughed in your face.  Nice start by te Sixers so far
Jared B::Man Julius Randle would look great in a Hawks uni though...
J::Louis Williams is back from the ligament injury. Pretty gruesome if you ask me. IF Lou has returned, Rajon Rondo isn't far behind. Lou, last time I checked, has 5 points. Not bad! I'm expecting a season debut like Wilson Chandlers'.
PKM::Both these teams have had a decent start to the season.
Raphy::whatsup with millsap?
Rhett B::I'm confused.....Why the HELL is Lavoy Allen still a Sixer?
