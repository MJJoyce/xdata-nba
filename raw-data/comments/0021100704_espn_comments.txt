fairandbalanced00::A lot of hate on Lebron in this board, especially from chicago fans, they want to forget that Lebron has punished your team in several occasions and dissected your bulls in the ECF, remember game 5? in the same token bull fans failed to realized that your lebrick rose is the most overrated player I've seen, he's a ball hogger point guard, commits lots of turnovers, is an erratic shooter AND has chocked in the final minutes against good teams and the Heat dating back from the ECF last years. So, chicago, YOU have a choker in your team and has proven it time after time in games that mattered, not against poor teams like toronto. drose plays against the Heat= Heat victory and ECF champs.
ChiBulls1224::Heat fans are the world's biggest bandwagon jumpers. Chalupa, you keep riding LeBron's dicck alright. $@%!
ScarecrowKeyserSoze::a bandwagon hater talking crap about bandwagon fans... The irony.
DeezBrown::@Dr Killapatient... Prime example. That the price you have to pay for being a fan of a championship caliber team.
DeezBrown::In order to be a Heat fan you all should make people pass a team history quiz or something. Clearly some people that "like" the heat are LeBron riders and it makes the real fans look bad. Same thing with "Kobe" fans, I know ya'll feel me since most of ya'll can talk some good basketball talk.
Dr Killapatient::Honestly, lots of haters come on the Heat boards to hate on lebron... Not the team, just lebron.... So it's natural for Heat fans to defend him since he's a player on there team..... I could understand if more fans of basketball came on different boards to chat about basketball... But all I hear is Gloria James this, Delonte West that, Lebrick, Lebron is not clutch nonsense all day.... So, that's just how it is I guess...
DeezBrown::That's idiotic but like you said that's just how it is. You can not like a player or a team and not be insulting geez! It turns real bball fans off to the idea of posting.
boom.shaka.::...
DolphinsMarrlinsfanup::how did turiaf look?
D Wade fan since 04-05::Did good for the minutes he played
Timmys Crossover136::Wow, silly me to come on these boards thinking i was gonna learn about the game i missed last night. But i forgot the rule. Heat lose=bang on lebron 5x harder. Heat win= bang on lebrons hairline 20x harder. Dueces Heat fans, see you sunday
DolphinsMarrlinsfanup::ditto
nba is the worst::So will the groupies now start talking about lebr0n's "almost historic PER" the way they do about his "almost triple doubles"?
6_23_LBJ_MVP_HOF_CHAMPION::Dude, he is only .14 point percentage away from achieving the best PER in history last time I checked. Anyways, Lebron is one of the few players today who is known to have trip-dubs in a season, at one point he had 10 triple doubles in one season.
nba is the worst::;)
ScarecrowKeyserSoze::Alot better.
brandonlee561heat22::Me too, im taking L'ville with the points, and L'ville first to score 20 points in a prop bet
nba is the worst::No - but I am rooting for Louisville all the way!
brandonlee561heat22::You putting down some bets on college basketball?
nba is the worst::He's now .34 below #1 - if it stays there it would be 7th alltime - as if the stat means anything, with the emphasis on free throws...  Does it somehow make you feel better to call internet strangers "losers", Scarecrow?
ScarecrowKeyserSoze::There's no point in arguing with NBA is the worst. Such a loser.
Olliebasketballs::6-15 shooting from Mr History.  Looks like your boy is reverting to the mean.  First the legendary 28% shooting performance against the Magic, and now this.  Bron will be shooting in the 40s by the end of the season and his team will finish in 2nd or 3rd place overall.   It would be a farce for LeRef to win the MVP this year.  The award should go to the best player on the best team, every year.
ScarecrowKeyserSoze::And the best player on the best team winning MVP makes sense but barely happens. Note Derrick Rose winning last year
nba is the worst::First, MVP is a popularity contest without a published definition or criteria to make it objective, so how can any player "deserve" it?  2nd, the "best player on the best (by W-L record) team" was the case last year for Rose, and the previous 2 years for lebr0n...  When kobe won it in '08, the celtics had the best record - and they had three allstars.  That's interesting, don't you think, regarding the heatles situation...
ScarecrowKeyserSoze::Just because you wait for him to have an off day to post this doesn't mean he doesn't deserve mvp. And who cares if they finish second, or third as long as they finish higher than 8th in their conference. The Heat don't overachieve through the regular season.
brandonlee561heat22::&lt;5,000 comments on a Heat board, what is this world coming to...
Taphawn::is that a picture of cole, wow , thats gay
CyBuck1::I'm sure the circus of trolls will be in town Sunday night.  Good luck with that.  Should be a good game.
nba is the worst::Sweet sixteen + blowout.  Probably get 10K on Sunday
BlixtonReeves::Hey I just da Bulls pulled ahead of the mighty Heat in the LBJ, er the Hollinger power rating, Mr Hotsauce Chalupa. I thought the Bulls were gonna have to be at least 10 games to merit that privalege. Guess those cash payments must have hit a little snag en route to Mr Hollinger, eh?
leehwgoC::Hard to argue with the Bulls beating the Heat this regular-season even sans Rose.  I'd put them ahead at this point, too.   Although of course, people were saying something similar heading into last season's playoffs, and look how that turned out...
Ray Allen Fan91::Javale Mcgee is so stupid
nba is the worst::That's debatable - but why post your opinion here?
BH_DiRTyBiRd::I hate, HATE, the Heat, but props to them for calling attention to the Trayvon Martin fiasco.
Kk121989::And I hate, HATE, you, but props to you recognizing it.
nahhb::nba draft, all nba players are eligible where would u guys put wade? this site had him 10th, seemed too low http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/
Dane Kitazaki::second behind lebron
THA TRUTH 365::WOW, WITH ALL THE LEBRON HATE, I ALMOST FORGOT THAT HE HAS THE BEST STATS IN THE NBA AND THE HEAT HAVE THE 2ND BEST RECORD. WHO WOULD HAVE THUNK IT; MVP AND BEST DEFENDER IN THE LEAGUE, WOW.
Ultimate-UCLA-Fan::best overall player but idk about defender.....
Dr Killapatient::What do you mean???? IDK as a Defender? Lebron?? Or are you talking about someone else???
Rdiu::he's definitely the best player in the league...................................for the first 3 quarter
All Tebow Does Is Sin::I know only behind the best team in the league!  THE CHICAGO BULLS
Kk121989::How did Turiaf do?
Kk121989::That's whats up
Kk121989::And get some much needed rebounds
Dane Kitazaki::yeah, someone who is able to finish aroubd the rim is nice for a change
Dane Kitazaki::from what i read on the heat reaction,  pretty good
KaliGuy010::The Heat may be favorites to win the title but im not believing it until i see it.  Heats biggest weakness is half court basketball which is playoff basketball. Open court Lebron and wade it almost an automatic Two but Lebron, Wade and bosh can be contained in the Half court and sometimes even SHUTDOWN. (see Lebron 2 finals) LEBRON has played horribly in the 2 finals also and last year there was NO EXUCSE for playing that horribly with WADE and Bosh as your teammates
madewunmi::all that is true. but i find it ridiculous that people have condemned the career of a player in his prime. if you heard conversations before hand they werent even suppose to get past boston.  now it's the ultimate failure that a chip wasnt brought home the first yr?
Dane Kitazaki::u typed all of that?  lol
Goon-::Heat and Thunder Sunday. That's gonna be big.
Robert156877::It's still only a regular season game.  After Sunday the Heat will be 2 games behind the Bulls.
Dancing_Chalupa::I'd love to see Lebron dunk over Perkins just to see how he reacts to it.
Dancing_Chalupa::Should be entertaining
Goon-::That was a good game, hope this one exceeds it.
Dancing_Chalupa::Yep. Eddie House hitting the game winner and swinging balls.
Goon-::A rematch of the "fake tough guy" game from last year.
madewunmi::what's with all these non fans. when you come on someone else's forum to dump on their star player repeatedly without rest you know youre pathetic.
THA TRUTH 365::ISN'T IT IRONIC HOW EVERYONE HATES LEBRON,  BUT EACH AND EVERY NBA TEAM WOULD  DO ANYTHING  AND  EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO HAVE HIM PLAY FOR THEM.
RicoSuave925::I would have him if the NBA only had 3 quarters and no NBA finals...
THA TRUTH 365::WITH HIM YOUR PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEED TO MAKE IT TO THE FINALS. LEBRON AND POST SEASON OR WATCHING IT AT HOME, TAKE YOUR PICK.
CyBuck1::Whomever lost their dancing chalupa troll on the Bulls board, please pick him up at the service desk.  Thank you.
RicoSuave925::"COME ON LEBRON WIN A RING CAUSE I'M RUNNING OUT OF EXCUSES AND BEEN WAITING SINCE 2003" - LeChoke young delusional fans...
GOBIGRED4638::A lot quiter over other than the NC-State page
Free Sam Hurd::LOL at Heat fans calling Lakers and Bulls fans bandwagon fans.  The Lakers have been an elite team nearly the entire history of the NBA, there hasn't been time to jump off the bandwagon. The Bulls were near the top of the league in attendance during the Ron Mercer/Marcus Fizer era. The Heat had to paint their seats a different color so the empty seats weren't so obvious on TV.
Dancing_Chalupa::All of that doesn't mean you all aren't bandwagoneers.  Frauds. Spend all night in here bashing. And still giving the runaround.
ScarecrowKeyserSoze::If you can't see an empty seat no matter what color it is you are a moron.
basketball good NBA bad::Lebron is "The Chokin' One".
lordcid69::Remember when it was Tragic Magic.  LOL @ your shortsightedness and lack of basketball knowledge
dsupertech::i did. i don't have to google it either. Magic and MJ were criticized by the bball media as being unable to win it all. Magic won his first year but it was highly regarded as Kareem's team Magic's rookie season. Kareem and Worthy carried that team cause Magic had no outside shot what-so-ever.
Dancing_Chalupa::You going to lie and say you were watching?
lordcid69::I'm not doing all your work for you, google tragic magic
basketball good NBA bad::Magic won a title (and Finals MVP) in his rookie season and kicked a.s.s while doing it.  WTF are you talking about?
lordcid69::Before magic did it you would be one of the people calling him tragic magic, the man who couldn't win it.
basketball good NBA bad::Magic delivered 5 NBA titles and played all 5 positions exceptionally well.  But what does that have to do with LeBron being "The Chokin' One"?
Free Sam Hurd::Lebron nuthuggers: Kobe couldn't get to the playoffs that 1 year. Sensible NBA fan: Lebron couldn't win a title those 7 years.
