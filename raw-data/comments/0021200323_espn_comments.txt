cha2601::Melo's playing like a $@%!$@%!$@%!$ beast right now. Keeps this up, along w/ good defense, and if amare comes back and helps the team chemistry, they'll win the nba championship. No team out west can compete with the beast of the east. Only thing left is for that to be decided, which will happen when Knicks play Heat in conference finals.

winterhunt::Pringles is an idiot... So glad he is gone...
SRQLivesForever::no way the knicks ain't winnin da championship this year  after all, we got MELO
DodgersLakersBruins81::long live the public school system
rdkpurdue1::Lakers need to get healthy because those bench players starting aren't fixing anything
RUMBLEizmyWINGMAN::hahahaha 9-14 suck it lakers
DodgersLakersBruins81::end of the world...
Emoney321.000::There's a lot of stuff going on about this elementary school shooting. It's really sickening. The guy had ties to the school and there might have been more than one shooter/suspect in this. They also say that the shooting happened in just one section of the school. Imagine if he went around the entire school? It's really just sad what happened
CubicleJoe::yeah, word is that his mother taught kindergarten and he went right for those rooms.
RUMBLEizmyWINGMAN::yea the suspects mom was killed as well
ButtaSports::knicks are fools gold, see what happens when all those threes they take don't fall in the playoffs
CubicleJoe::they are defending well and moving the ball effectively.  i think they have as good a shot as anyone if they keep the same approach.
__SPURS21::And take in who is on the bench due to injury, Iman Shumpert and Amare Stoudamare. These Knicks team are for real. Deepest team in the League.
Rambomonster9::i hate to tell you laker fans but a coach only effects a game so much.  it is the play of the players.  2 different systems with same results
__SPURS21::Is Carmelo's time to get his ring. Man playing like an MVP he should win if he and his team continue to go on like this then he should win, over Durant and Lebron. Melo is going for the damn ring.
Rambomonster9::Kobe stands around in the middle on defense on every play. No effort.
cdavisj24::Well he should retire if he can't give his all anymore
Maschil::he's a 17 year vet.... give him a break.20 yrs with playoffs games
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::So sick , that guy who killed the kids  ,went too school shot his mother ( who was a teacher at that school ) also killed his brother , in nj w t f
Rambomonster9::sickening.  prayers to the families.
Emoney321.000::yeah, it was horrible. I live just 30 minutes away from where it happened, too
Emoney321.000::yeah, i feel really bad for any of those families with kids from that school.
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Really dam , I'm just sad on Xmas day while family having fun etc, these poor family's lost there love ones , living on a saddest days of there lives
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::It really looks like the world is crashing down these days
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::CubicleJoe - yes and no - bad people have been around forever, you know?  information travels more quickly now.  Your are right on that point , but it's just a shame too hear
CubicleJoe::yes and no - bad people have been around forever, you know?  information travels more quickly now.
CubicleJoe::pretty awful stuff.  mind boggling.
Maschil::K guys. what do you all think? Lakers this bad because of Lakers, or this bad because of D'anTONI?
Maschil::ill be worried after all star break if the lakers arent above .500.... but either D'Antoni has to go, or he has to think about playing D.... and i would muh rather see him go
KobeThinksLakerFansAreDumb....I Agree::d'antoni and to be more specific , his system. The system and players don't fit. They would have been better off with mike brown believe it or not.
Maschil::thats what i think...they should have signed Phil... sure he isnt the 1 guy fixer up... but coaching is about getting the most out of the players you have... and he has the experience to know how to do it....
SRQLivesForever::will melo be back by christmas?
Maschil::hope so.
Heat_Master_Sage::prob would rest against the cavs and be ready for the next game
SRQLivesForever::ok so probably not for the cavs but the game after that most likely
Heat_Master_Sage::it's just an ankle sprain
Heat_Master_Sage::WE GOT TO DEFEND THIS HOUSE
OrdellR::Dwight Howard is an abor tion for many reasons. Last night, hitting Melo up in the air was just the latest. D bag
Maschil::dont you guys have better things to do in life? Dwight is a much better all around player then shaq. Much better. the foul on melo was clean....
SRQLivesForever::dwight thought he was bigger than orlando when he was still on the magic. now it's really bit him in the $@%.
bob0000010::He is a d-bag and he pretends he's as good as shaq. yeah right!
bob0000010::School shooting huh?  Not as interesting as watching the lakers lose
bob0000010::thank you. now back to laker jokes please
ameans474::classless humor
SRQLivesForever::dude c'mon the shooting was horrible, but there's nothing any of us can do about it. it is what it is. let's just enjoy a little distraction in sports.
SRQLivesForever::Knicks are 9-0 at home  DEFEND THIS HOUSE
bob0000010::finally someone is talking about basketball on here...
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::CNN says 30 killed smh
kirby_314::I hope that son of a $@%!$ rot in hell If i could have got my hands on him before he died  I would have tortured his @%!.
bob0000010::School shootings are fun!
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Your are just stupid flag jack a s s
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Agreed
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Sports is sports us fans we cheer for our teams, when something happens like this by killing kids, we get more forces on life it self
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::The world going mad these days killing young ones smh etc
steven6623::those poor children in connecticut smh
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Dam
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::The world is crazy man , who was that guy that killed people in school
steven6623::they arent saying yet but they said they raided his house and his mother was in there dead
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Crazy about sports , win or lose still get paid millions lol
strongisland06::Or suck and still get millions.  JaMarcus Russell
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::That dudes is suck a joke , I'm sure he  will be broke soon
sportsrbust::Great game Knicks, GL the rest of the year!
2.3.1 Douple Play::Lakers are heating up, 3 moral victories in a row now!
steven6623::lakers bench is a disgrace. sacre and those dudes have no business even being on an nba basketball court
Maschil::i dont worry about the bench to be honest... the lakers bench for the last 5 years has been ok...
playemball::There's no bench..they use chairs..;)
sportsrbust::lol, how you doing Major?
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Fact , not even that there D is a joke
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Who cares, the  world is  going to end dec 21 11:13 pm lol jk
playemball::What exactly was Howard trying to do last night when he fouled Melo?
sportsrbust::Can you only imagine if Melo did that to Kobe at the Staple center?
bob0000010::yeah everyone would get mad at him
Seskatchewan::pulling a Westbrook. Fouls people when their frustrated
steven6623::not get blown out
StanNYGKRY::he fouled him hard... i thought it was a clean play he just landed badly
bob0000010::no it was a stupid play
strongisland06::Stop a player (Melo) who was beasting on his team
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Dude is lost
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::As long the heat don't win this year, it has been a good year lol
TheWyseWon::Someone said Lakers have no #1 picks this year
StanNYGKRY::they have a first rounder.. they just usually trade it away for cash considerations
Rodneycash20122012::the Lakers hardly ever have a 1st rounder.
StanNYGKRY::i think phoenix gets the lakers #1 pick but its protected
strongisland06::Suns get in return from the Lakers.   In return, the Suns get four draft picks -- first rounders in 2013 and 2015 and second rounders in 2013 and 2014.
strongisland06::Nash sign and trade deal
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Why they signed  old Nash it's just stupid , when he comes back better bring his wheelchair with him
steven6623::it will be known as the christmas day massacre. knicks 120 lakers 85
Rodneycash20122012::well probably not that score.
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Sad but true
strongisland06::I like
DefensiveRebounds::If McGee wasn't so weird and dumb he has the potential to be like Wilt. I mean he's got the athleticism and body, just not the basketball stuff.
Seskatchewan::Denver needs to utilize him, not their bench
Seskatchewan::whats wrong with mcGee?
DefensiveRebounds::dude tackled his own teammate lol
nflfan902::LA Teams= adding superstars and being overrated (except the kings)
Rodneycash20122012::The Kings kicked some a$$ in the playoffs.  I am so pissed about the stupid f'ing lockout.  I had tickets for opening night against the Rangers.  Banner hang hasn't happened yet.  DAMN!
strongisland06::The Dodgers need to refrain from spending big money
Rodneycash20122012::too late.  They have a hellava shot this coming season though.
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Bad coaching
Rodneycash20122012::Jerry Buss needs to kick his son in the head and take over again!
TheWyseWon::He has veto power I'm sure.  I put more blame on Kupchak.
Rodneycash20122012::cant argue that.
TheWyseWon::Kupchak doesn't either...they sold the old man on D'Antoni and now they are paying.
Rodneycash20122012::Jim didnt like Phil, plain and simple.
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Fact Jim buss is the next Jerry jones of NBA
Rodneycash20122012::jj = jim buss
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::steven6623 - jj &gt; buss  Fail they both suck
steven6623::jj &gt; buss
Rodneycash20122012::no doubt
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::What's sad football almost over smh
Aint Bout Dis Life::thank goodness its almost the weekend.
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Football woohoo lol
DefensiveRebounds::It sucks that most players of today only care about athleticism and flashy stuff. Except for Lillard tho.
TheWyseWon::If Red Auerbach was still around he would be looking for basketball players and others would follow.  Today, GMs don't know how to evaluate basketball talent, so they look for athletes
DefensiveRebounds::Dwight is baby food for Hakeem. I reckon 40 on him all day.
Rodneycash20122012::No one, I mean no one will ever have the 18' sky hook from the baseline again.
strongisland06::Hakeem was great. One of the best players
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Fact
LeBron - Miami Heat - James::Shaq was the last true center.
StanNYGKRY::there are maybe 10-15 centers left in the nba the rest are power forwards playing center
bob0000010::Boring. Fun to watch big men crush little people
steven6623::lopez but he's always hurt and cousins
Rodneycash20122012::lopez not even close
bob0000010::sadly so. The nba is killing them off.  Guards are ok, but would you want to watch an all-star game lineup of t-mac and allen-iverson?  There's no passing!
LeBron - Miami Heat - James::it's a guard driven league now
DefensiveRebounds::When will big men start averaging 21-27 and 10-14 again? The rebounding part is coming back though.
TheWyseWon::Yea, Howard had 7 last night
bob0000010::Q: What does 7 seconds of less stand for?  A: The time it takes to sweep Antoni's team out of the playoffs
bob0000010::He can coach an upstart team, but not real teams with title hopes
Rodneycash20122012::they should have considered Jerry Sloan.
Rodneycash20122012::or*  maybe?
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::D'antoni is such a joke , I don't know why he's let back too coach in NBA
TheWyseWon::No such thing anymore as a Good Big Man!  Whatever happened to the centers all being 7-6?
Seskatchewan::Hasheem Thabeeeeeeeeeeet. 7'3. OKC took him from bust draft to contributor!!
strongisland06::Best centers this league has seen were 7'0' - 7'3'
TheWyseWon::rumor was in the 90s that in 20 years they would be 7-6.  That's what I'm referring too
nflfan902::well bynum is a big man but he's busy getting strikes than back on the court
Rodneycash20122012::bynum with a bowling ball in his hand?  cant picture that one.
Aint Bout Dis Life::hes busy with his hair appointments.
Aint Bout Dis Life::who yao ming and georghe mursehuean?
Rodneycash20122012::Kareem was the best!
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::Fact
bob0000010::What happened to all the Laker haters making jokes on here?
nflfan902::no more defense
Rodneycash20122012::recycling the same jokes over and over got boring.
LeBron - Miami Heat - James::their record is funny enough
LeBron - Miami Heat - James::2002, 2010
RON-BURGUNDY-STAY-CLASSY::No what's funny Lebron rigged ring
strongisland06::They feel bad about the Lakers now
DefensiveRebounds::Was Dwight's foul some "Bad Boy Pistons" stuff or not? What was it?
bob0000010::He's an idiot. He's a poor excuse for a center.  Has no moves, can't shoot free throws. His game is trash.  Shaq was waaaaay better in his prime
Heat_Master_Sage::Chalmers sucks x_x SIGN THE BASKET CASE, WE WANT WEST
steven6623::why so he can fucc lebron's mom
Heat_Master_Sage::that would be awesome. bwuahaha
LeBron - Miami Heat - James::no way, lol
nflfan902::west and lebron?   No way no how
bob0000010::I like to watch ghetto fouls in basketball  -Moronic bored NFL fans on this forum
DefensiveRebounds::you ain't black enough.
bob0000010::No what are you?
Rodneycash20122012::whats a ghetto foul?
Rodneycash20122012::i thought Howard's foul was a good one.  It was just a bump
bob0000010::When someone fouls you hard, in a non-basketball way and then says "it's part of the game"
LeBron - Miami Heat - James::are you Rob Parker?
steven6623::tyson chandler should be an allstar
pepex192::i think Noah should be an allstar because he has put up great number with a team that struggles to score at time and rose is out
strongisland06::He does deserve some consideration
Aint Bout Dis Life::because he can dunk?
DefensiveRebounds::steven6623 - cause he's the best big man in the east  ------------- Noah? Horford? Lopez?
steven6623::cause he's the best big man in the east
