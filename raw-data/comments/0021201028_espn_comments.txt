Beanslams46::With all that officiating love, the rockets are winning with lots of undeserved free throws....
Denzel7587::Fans1000 Another terrible game by Lin, 4 points and 3 turnovers. The Knicks did the right thing to get rid of Lin and that's why they are having much better records this year with Felton and Kidd at PG. ___________________________ Sure, Lin has a bad game except for his amazing first 6 minutes of the first quarter. And why are you trying to justify this poor performance to support your argument that the Knicks made the right decision in getting rid of Lin? Check Felton's stats: 41 $@%!$@ minutes of play, 3 assists and a total of 7 points. Felton's performance is not amazing at all compared to Lin's 4 points, 6 assists in 20 minutes of play. Next time you bash Lin, be sure you're standing on a sure footing. Good luck then. Please take time to acquire a brain and then study.
Canes2082::LMAO @ Cleveland.... Lebron toyed with all of you the other night... He threw all the hate right back in your face.... Have fun never winning anything Cleveland your town and teams are a joke
JLinNASA::NBA is rigged.  YouTube actual game footages of fake calls.  It was upsetting and sad.   I predict not one, not two, not three but multiple championships. -David Stern
scottsvb1::Without South Beach.....Miami would be a Hispanic Hotel....Wait, it already is.
Beanslams46::don't get mad a southbeach, it's the pampered nba players there that irks the world with their phony win streak built on opponents' penalty fouls and heat's undeserved free throws.
Denzel7587::Lin played poorly overall in this game except for the first 6 minutes of the first quarter where he scored 2 points and dished out 4 assists, contributing 10 points of the Rockets 13 points.   The Rockets won this one because of greater ball movement: whether it's Lin, Beaverly or Brooks playing PG, the Rockets are doing fine if the PGs are are allowed to do their primary job. Lin had 6,  Beaverly 5 and Brooks 4 assists compared to Harden's 2 assists.
JLinNASA::Trying to satisfied the LOFs.  Haha.  Lin didn't have a stellar game.  He shots weren't falling tonight.  Glad he didn't force his shots (Melo) and found other way to help the team, like defense and assists.  Good game, Rox!
Selvin4715::Thanks for the daily Lin update
Denzel7587::Dominant win for the Rockets. Good job, Rockets!
Juli7563::Carnival in laker's board. go join it

ChuckCharlesCharlie::haha I was shock that they lost to the Wizards LMAO
JasonY79::Lin often plays poorly before big games. It's almost as if to tell the Spurs, "Don't worry about me. I won't be doing much. Lower your expectations." It happened a lot last year, too. The most notable one is the Bobcats before going  28/14 against the Mavericks.
JLinNASA::Well, Lin. Stopped doing that.  Try to play well every game.  We need to win every game.  Sometimes the weaker teams will be your only win.
George85146::that was the hornets, not the bobcats, but I get your point
FromCantonese::not fun to watch
19Houston75::"NewcastleFanVL Arguably the Lakers are better than the Rox right now."  Post of the night. :)
sports guy12::was that a troll?
JCabby25::I bet Pau Gasol and Dwight want to come to Houston after that game. Oof.
Vega_2012::We dont want grandpa Gasol! We want Dwight :)
George7844::No thanks......we don't want "Hack-a-Dwight" Howard. Gasol would be a better fit for the Rockets.
Dawan208::Either would be nice.
JCabby25::I think he'll come to Houston or Brooklyn. And hey, if he goes to Brooklyn, we better get Brook Lopez.
Fans1000::Another terrible game by Lin, 4 points and 3 turnovers.  The Knicks did the right thing to get rid of Lin and that's why they are having much better records this year with Felton and Kidd at PG.
Denzel7587::How would you know that the Knicks had a better record without Lin? Lin was a benchwarmer in Knicks. The Knicks had a better record when Lin played as the Knicks'; starting PG.
rm90025::I guess you conveniently ignored all the oher games he has played this month and the prior 2 months, the 6 assists, the +/-, and how he pushed the ball to get other guys who had not been playing well some good touches....... And that he only played 20 minutes.  Jason Kidd has had many 2/7 nights and it hasn't hurt his standing.  The Cavs are a crappy team and the Rockets didn't need Lin to take over some of the scoring load as the have over the past several ames.  The next 4 games are very tough, though, and Lin will need to look for his shot more and grt aound 14 shots per ame.
Dawan208::Well we shut Fans1000 up.:)
19Houston75::lol, why does he need to take 14 shots? Where did you come up with that nice round number?
Dawan208::I looked up the box scores and both Fellton and old Kidd got a TOTAL of 14 points. LOL!!  Looks like Melo is carrying that team.  Hope he doesn't get hurt again.
Dawan208::One bad game.  I'm glad he's out from under the Knicks.  They aren't going no where.  Ha ha ha!!
Dawan208::Knicks only beat crappy eastern teams .
19Houston75::Moronic troll. Knicks have a better record because 66% of their games are played against Eastern conference opponents.
Selvin4715::lakers lost? hahahahahha
Selvin4715::EVERYBODY GO TROLL
19Houston75::lol, called that one. Go Lakers!!
Kassom69::John Wall must have a good shooting coach.  Now that's someone who has improved his jumper.  He's on his way to be coming an excellent point guard.
rm90025::Lin has a better shooting % than Wall.
JCabby25::The Lakers board is crazy. Comments rolling quickly. LOL
Vega_2012::mostly every teams nba fans flood that board to troll :D
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::u got a scary mutt there
JCabby25::I have to say, it's pretty funny. Lol
bobbydagreat::Always. When they choke a game away it's people laughing at them, when they win, it's their fans gloating.
bobbydagreat::Kobe chokes the game away.
bobbydagreat::And of course Kobe hits the "too little too late" 3 to make it close
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::but Jazz blew it too so Jazz don't move up.  Only Rockets do.
bobbydagreat::Wall nails both FT's and it's official, the Bullets beat the Lakers.
Vega_2012::Alirght guys i just got back from the game, pretty aweseom time
Vega_2012::And robinson actually looks taller in person also
JCabby25::It's always fun going to a Rockets game. Love how the team plays ball. Good to hear you had a great time!
Vega_2012::thanks, i try to at least one every season.
bobbydagreat::It certainly was fun to watch
bobbydagreat::Oh yeah, he's a legit 7 footer
Vega_2012::it was actually pretty packed at the game, suprisingly.  DMo is one very tall man in person
bobbydagreat::Ron Artest forgetting that he can't drive, John Wall choking......it's coming down to the wire
bobbydagreat::That was a clutch defensive stop by the refs there, it gives the Lakers a chance to widen the gap on the Bullets
bobbydagreat::I'm surprised literally every time Ron Artest hits a 3 pointer.
LetsGoMavs-::Lakers choking
bobbydagreat::Looks like they aren't choking enough.
19Houston75::Just have to give this a bump  The Rockets had/have a league leading 23 sets of back to back games. I believe the Spurs and Mavs don't have that many combined. That means you can rule out being centralized in the country. The funny part is, with the exception of the strike and lockout shortened seasons, the Rockets lead the league with 20+ b2b's every season.
bassadilla05::David Stern and the league scheduler dumped a big one on the Rockets this year because they didn't expect them to be any good. Then Daryl Morey pulled Harden out of the ether and we turned into something interesting. It is only sheer DUMB LUCK that the final game of the season will be Rockets-Lakers with potential seeding implications between two teams that really came on strong at the end of the year.
NewcastleFanVL::Arguably the Lakers are better than the Rox right now.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::not the way T-Rob and D Mo played tonight..if THEY do this every night, Rockets are better then 8th seed Lakers!!
Kassom69::Wall is so overrated.
JustinBrownsCavsBuckeyes::last year he tried SOOO hard to get rising starts mvp. Kyrie just went in there and said gimme dat. that was so funny. He choked in a gimme game.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::just cause he airballed a minute ago??  fair-weather..
Bandwagon_Bobcats.Fan::Harden is the best player in the league at getting a ton of points without many FGA's
Kassom69::You got that right.   He's so good at getting the other team in foul trouble.   A work of art
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::tonight it was a team effort...if only it was this easy every night but it can be if Harden does his job in the FIRST HALF of each game and Lin as well!!
JustinBrownsCavsBuckeyes::Well, Utah lost and it looks like the Lakers are beating up the Bullets. Cavs get the Lakers pick if they make the playoffs. Cavs could very well have the #1 overall pick and the 16th pick in the draft, and then possibly 3 #1's in next years draft.  Chris Grant is a great G.M.
19Houston75::Wizards will come back to win.
LetsGoMavs-::Lakers choking right now
LetsGoMavs-::mavs won dumb###
Kassom69::Like the Mavericks
JustinBrownsCavsBuckeyes::Don't matter. Utah already lost
LetsGoMavs-::James Harden = Superstar  Jeremy Lin = Overpaid and OVERRATED
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::youre just a bitter sad Mavs fans who is bitter about not going to the playoffs...
19Houston75::LetsGoMavs- - Rockets lost 3 times to the worst mavs team in 13 years  #SAD  Even the sun shines on a dog's $@% some days.
LetsGoMavs-::Rockets lost 3 times to the worst mavs team in 13 years  #SAD
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::the same Mavs who have beat the Rockets this year like what, 3 times? and yet Mavs miss playoffs and Rockets don't??
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::you haveta come back slowly the first year after knee surgery anyway.. look how long D Rose is going to take for his..
woopzzzz::lin's doing just fine for a first year starter. and making lots of dough and getting attention for the rockets
Kassom69::Oh no here comes the troll
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::not after these last two game, bro..
woopzzzz::lin didnt have a good game but we all know he only cares for team wins not individual stats.   LIN FOR DA TEAM WIIIINNNNN!!!!
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::I forgot the quotes when I quoted you directly but other then that, I did superb.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::dude, Lin needs to generate more team wins for this yay lin for team win thing to take off..
woopzzzz::wow your english grammar is horrible
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::Rockets are like a family of meer cats..always getting each other's backs!!
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::Well they were showing mir cats on the rockets game so I copied professionals..you sir do not like that..
JustinBrownsCavsBuckeyes::Mir cats are near the bottom of the food chain
JustinBrownsCavsBuckeyes::You could have said that they're like a pride of lions. They're a family, too. And way cooler than bottom feeding mir cats. lol
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::but the human reference is that of sticking together like a family..you know of humans and not talking about the animal kingdom there! hello, mcflyyyy
Eden Knight::We need the Rocket bigs and the bench to show up against non shorthanded teams too...
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::can't forget Beverley's mastery of the Cavs..good for the old team win!
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::i agree..but it was nice to see T Rob get his 15 points tonight and D Mo to get his dime sack and assists to Asik too
bobbydagreat::Give it time, they're young. The entire team is inconsistent not just the bigs
bobbydagreat::Good day for Houston, the Rockets win and now the Texans signed Shane Lechler
clutch1091::Graham is the kicker. Don't know why they let Donny walk though.
bassadilla05::They could let Graham go as long as the rookie kicker is back and healthy this year
Axl de la Fuente::Lechler&gt;Donnie
19Houston75::They signed a punter? What was wrong with Graham?
Axl de la Fuente::Graham was their field goal kicker, not the punter.
bobbydagreat::Yeah I heard of Ed Reed as well, two damn good signings and both for cheap
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::never heard of him.. you heard of Ed Reed??
3rdCoastTexan281::Lechler is probably the best punter in NFL history, and Ed Reed might be the best safety in NFL history.
Destruct0id::We can take the Clippers but we always seem to face them on a back to back.
19Houston75::The Rockets had/have a league leading 23 sets of back to back games. I believe the Spurs and Mavs don't have that many combined. That means you can rule out being centralized in the country. The funny part is, with the exception of the strike and lockout shortened seasons, the Rockets lead the league with 20+ b2b's every season.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::stupid stern and his cronies/henchman messing up Rockets biorhythms..I hope the NBA gets next-years schedule right for the Rockets..they deserve more ESPN/TNT and ABC games and less back2backs..and thats a fact, jack!
HunterF4444::Thanks for taking it easy on my Cavs, Houston.
19Houston75::2 full quarters.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::we learned from that bullcorn with Mark Jackson ...you keep playing your sets..its like a movie you want to keep acting and rehearsing the same skits
Destruct0id::We let the bench play for a full quarter, what more do you want?
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::Iggy isnt really a great fit here..I mean this isn't lob city and we got a resident dunker in Greg Smith (and T rob until tonight) already!!  I rebuke this suggestion vociferously!!
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::and yet not a single online or any high publication has written a single story on his defense..not one..you got any links to prove this?
3rdCoastTexan281::http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/21622844/behind-the-screen-inside-the-defensive-mind-of-andre-iguodala
Destruct0id::Iggy isn't for highlight dunking. He's for defense, something Rockets is clearly lacking
Destruct0id::Guy went to the OLYMPICS with the greatest players in the NBA because of his defense.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::dude, Has Iggy even made one all-defense team before you spit this baloney??
orange_63::three years of sucking since lebron left.......$@%! the cavs! and $@%! gilbert!
3rdCoastTexan281::CP3, D12, Iggy, Jack/Okafor/Allen  That's who I call to inquire about in the offseason and in that order.
Hoops Sharpie::not in a million years would paul even consider coming here, stop wasting your time talking about him.
3rdCoastTexan281::Do I really need to repeat myself? Look at the comment I made directly above yours...
Destruct0id::Yeah I don't see CP3 leaving pointguard heaven with Griffin and Jordan
3rdCoastTexan281::Yeah that's why I worded it the way I did...."call to inquire about"
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::and Iggy isnt really a great fit here..I mean this isn't lob city and we got a resident dunker in Greg Smith (and T rob until tonight) already!! I rebuke this suggestion vociferously!!
bobbydagreat::Iggy is a good defender, but he'd likely force Parsons to the bench and I'm not sure how he'd feel about that.
3rdCoastTexan281::We need a solid veteran defensive stopper...Iggy fits that description to a tee. So does Tony Allen.
bobbydagreat::Yeah, I agree, CP3 will say no REALLY quick, Howard probably would agree to come here unless the Lakers make a deep playoff run, Iggy would be interesting if he opted out of his deal and Okafor would be great C depth
Hoops Sharpie::iggy actually logs more minutes at SG than SF
bobbydagreat::Of course Iggy would force Parsons to the bench, so I'm not sure I'd be all for that idea either even though his D is really good
bobbydagreat::Iggy is the greatest shooter to ever play the game compared to Rondo....
3rdCoastTexan281::.460 career FG %
Hoops Sharpie::i thought you demand that all of our players are good 3 point shooters?  iggy can't shoot, period. great defender and finisher on the break, but that's it. so he doesn't fit your model.
Destruct0id::Can we pry Iggy from Denver?
bobbydagreat::Probably not, but he very well could.
Hoops Sharpie::he's not going to use it
bobbydagreat::He has an early termination clause, he could decide to use it
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::rockets are  ready NOW, imo..im sorry but im not even looking to next year other then the growth of this team in "year 2" basically
Destruct0id::Lin had three straight games with over 21 points while shooting over 50%. Something that only 30 players have done this year. So this "passive, nonagressive, unconfident" PG crap is baloney.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::this guy is beat up from the feet up!!
Hoops Sharpie::ready 'now' for what?  we have the worst PF's in the league.  a passive, nonagressive, unconfident PG.  and the worst defense in the league.
QNoir::But Parsons and Asik are perfect? Lol.
bobbydagreat::You are looking to add awful volume shooters and ball hogs to the team, I'm looking at what's best for the team even if it's not flashy.
Hoops Sharpie::wrong, i'm actually trying to improve the team whereas you're looking to constantly 'rebuild'
bobbydagreat::Wow you sure are negative about your Josh Smith dream being dead. Relax, you don't have to have on the Rockets just because they don't need the guys you like.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::its called passive aggressive worst defense aka or = best offense so it's a wash there.. your arguement has holes, large ones..craters  J Lin has looked REAL good last few games..very aggressive.. i dont care for your negative attitude. you sound like a non fan to me..right now
quickbr0wnf0x::Wow, to watch the video that goes with the ESPN article, you'd think the Cavs didn't make a single shot.  Heck, they didn't even take one.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::thats what happens when you get smashed like you got hit with a meteor from outer space where rockets live
Hoops Sharpie::lakers beasting with their 5 back
Destruct0id::Dude...Wizards w/o Beal
Destruct0id::I'll acknowledge them if they beat Golden State for us.
Hoops Sharpie::they've been playing much better lately though
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::The compared D MO to some of the great white players of the past..like greatest..this is good..this means he is very skilled!! the league should be worried next year for sure!!
Pair Of Wool Socks::Cleveland gets slaughtered. Shocker
quickbr0wnf0x::Missing their 3 best players, yeah.
quickbr0wnf0x::And they just came off an emotional close game where they had a real chance to knock off the Heat, with those same three players missing.
Destruct0id::Should the Rockets pursue a veteran player next year?
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::no let the youngins continue to grow...T ROB grew tonight and so did D Mo and J anderson and even Cisco kidd
bobbydagreat::I'm all for that, but I think the Rockets still make a run at Howard. If they don't get Howard I think they pick up a defensive center on the cheap and a few other role players instead of going for a big splash.
bobbydagreat::I'm not sure. I think it depends who has interest but there aren't a lot of players I'd want to waste money on.
KeriTheCreoleTexan::They will. That's out of the question.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::forget learning from pop for just one minute...James Anderson had a coming out party tonight for garbage time..but I thought TROB had his best game and D mo returned with a great game! wowow rockets even Bevs returned for a night after vising the crack house for 2 weeks
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::quit hoping and loko at the highlights of tonights game..
bobbydagreat::DMo will have his hands full against Splitter on Sunday.
bobbydagreat::I hope so too. DMo should drive more often, it usually leads to good things. The DMo to Asik connection is one that will be fun to watch going forward
Destruct0id::Hopefully D-Mo will school him in the post.
QNoir::This one dude keeps getting mad at Asians for liking Lin. He needs to look in the mirror and ask himself why Luke Walton is taken seriously, LOL!
quickbr0wnf0x::Not worth the contract, no, but he does bring certain positives to the table.  He has something to teach his young teammates.
19Houston75::His idiotic daddy is obviously pulling some strings.
KeriTheCreoleTexan::Luke Walton is dumpster juice and no one takes him seriously. No one.
ChuckCharlesCharlie::players don't take him serious but the GMs do! Lol look at his pay! WTF! are you serious!!!!?
Ismael0627::That was a long time ago. *Watched Life with Luke*
QNoir::He's in the NBA, lol. That's enough of a joke right there.
bobbydagreat::Wait, are you saying Luke Walton is taken seriously?
Ismael0627::*rewatching Heat vs Cavs* OMG, everyone thought it's cavaliers ball and they choked by 0.5 seconds.....
lyang912::CAVS effectively lost to the Rockets bench. But without their best 3 players, it's hard to ask them to play much better.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::if Rockets, especially James Anderson can play like this..he is going to get more PT..PT PT PT
sagematic::He must've learned a lot from pop
Destruct0id::The guy was on the Spurs and was only cut because of his injuries. Way better then Garcia.
bobbydagreat::Players that would not make the Rockets better.  Josh Smith. Rondo Brandon Jennings Monta Ellis Any other volume shooter Any other ball dominant player
19Houston75::Parsons is absolutely a superior athlete. At least in comparison to Ellis.
jordanfan2k11::parsons
bobbydagreat::Ellis is a garbage volume shooter, no thanks.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::ure just riding parsons dick..ellis would calm down and make rockets way better..parsons is not a superior athlete
jordanfan2k11::ellis for [arson would be the dumbest thing morey could ever do
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::I'll take Monta on this Rockets team and trade CHandler PArsons for him
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::i changed my mind..i can only give noone on the rockets for him..im sorry i know i will regret taking that back but i would..
bobbydagreat::I wouldn't.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::IF J Lin retired today, he will go down as the best table setter the rockets have ever had at guard..
19Houston75::The Rockets have had a few point guards that were easily better than Lin.
Spurts_will_never_make_ESPN_highlights::rockets got a steal in T-Rob, imo..look how he is growing.. after Mac coached him up..Give Mchale credit, guys..
Destruct0id::I really want either Faried or Kevin Love on our team. Those guys will be perfect....
JCabby25::I think Denver is going to keep Faried. But Kevin Love is a huge possibility.
Axl de la Fuente::I would like Kevin Love on the Rockets, but I lost alot of respect for him after he stomped on Luis Scola head
sagematic::Faried would be awesome.  Great player and great teammate
Hoops Sharpie::which team are you talking about?  heat? thunder? bulls? knicks?
Destruct0id::Hmm...I'm on the Rocket's board. I dunno?
