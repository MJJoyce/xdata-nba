eightbitme::Cleveland -  The city where Canadian Wild Geese drop their loads before heading south for the winter.    Only kidding.  :-)
Ihatebandwagons::I like Cleveland and Akron... Funny story I was in Akron recently and tried to catch a game... Stopped in at a place called The Old Haunts Tavern. It was a biggest s$%&amp; hole I've ever been in. Literally a place where only the most pathetic people on the planet would go. A local in there was like "The only reason I come here... So when I go anywhere else I feel like I'm living it up"... Akron Ohio is a funny place.

President R.L. Stine::see ya. take a shot for every ring!
Diamondslugz::Remember when Cory Snyder hit that game winning homerun over the Yankees and we won the pennant... I think they made a documentary about it... Check it out Its called Major League.
SNight322::Willie Mays Lofton was superb that year.
Strong Troll Orthenthald::Yata9arasu
yata9arasu::Hi.
President R.L. Stine::I asked a magic 8 ball if i will be able to see Cleveland win a championship. it said "No". So i am under the impression that in order for Cleveland to win a championship i must be blind. so...... what is the least painful way to make oneself blind?
SNight322::You're delusional. We've won 6 SBs already. Don't get greedy. (1968-69, 1980, 1986-87 and 2007)
President R.L. Stine::didn't Eric Barton have a great game?
SNight322::It should've been Braylon, who caught those 4 TDs in that game.
gri400::no it was the year of the immortal derek anderson. Setting passing records for yeads and completions
President R.L. Stine::i remember now. Brady Quinn won SB MVP right?

yata9arasu::Ask Jamison that.......................
SNight322::All you Cavs fans, I got an idea. Give one ping if you're all ears.
navyctr312::that ALCS in 07 still stings a lil inside.
SNight322::Okay. Since the concept of "rational thought" and "Cleveland fan" rarely get along, I say run with it. They make fun of us not winning championships, we just start stating that we've won 50 in the last 20 years, only we forgot to tell anyone. Just pretend we live in this imaginary dynastic world. No matter how much they try to "correct" us, just laugh at them.
gri400::ahh the 80's,i remember the cavs battles against the magic led lakers, 4 titles in 5 years for the cavs... magic had nothing on them
yata9arasu::BUT THEY TRADED FOR RG3!!!
SNight322::Back in 1980s, gri400. A long time and a galaxy far away.
gri400::redskins in the superbowl?? thats just crazy talk
Diamondslugz::That was the greatest World Series of all time when we beat the Rockies... I dont even hate the Red Sox anymore!!!
SNight322::Back-to-back SBs over the Giants and Redskins.
yata9arasu::Ahhhhhhhh............  I think it's coming back to me.............  The back to back titles with the Cavs....  The 07 WS win over the Rockies......  The Superbowl win in 07...............  :D
SNight322::yata, Miami is all delusional about the future. This idea rewrites the past.
SNight322::You can also use it next door at the AFCN board, too. I'm going to get Justin in on it if I can since he's all about the 8 championships thing.
Diamondslugz::2 steps ahead of you bud. LOL
yata9arasu:::(  I don't want to be a delusional Miami Heat fan.............
President R.L. Stine::i like what your thinkin. only problem i may have is that i may start to believe in this fantasy world and become entranced in a fake life.
SNight322::Halle Berry grew up in Bedford, but we exiled her for being the ugliest woman in Cuyahoga County.
gri400::hell i should just try to get the toronto sports fans to do the same thing... it just might work
President R.L. Stine::*ping
SNight322::I go to all the "special needs" schools with my completed  coloring books because I'm so much smarter than they are" -- Phil Montana
gri400::i color outside the lines but thats OK because i'm just being me --phil montana
yata9arasu::ROFL!!!!!!!
President R.L. Stine::Since the Colts are locked with Luck, Skins locked with RG3, and Vikes locked with Kalil. for the next 43 days the Browns are on the clock
cland4ever::they will go 2-14 and lerner shoudl sell the team to gilbert and sign bernie because he cares unlike some management right now
cland4ever::and all of the dam front office have the same dam agent and im sick of this long term plan. i guess their plan is letting any pieces they have on their team to go off in free agency and heckert believes he will hit on every pick so he wont need free agency
Diamondslugz::Only reason Shurmur is coach is because Holmgren coached with his dad.... but guys like you and me see through that $@%!.
President R.L. Stine::but i agree with ridding our franchise of Lerner
cland4ever::and holmgren is just collecting checks and pat shurmur is trying to figure out how to make an offense even more predictable and worse
President R.L. Stine::i think Holmgren and Heckert are doing well. they past 2 drafts have been successful. i wanna give the more time
Diamondslugz::True... Lerner only care about his $@%!$@% soccer team Aston Villa.
IrwinMink::from a quick look at the stats, you're not going to win when your PF plays 36 minutes and can't get a single rebound (while taking 18 shots)
yata9arasu::And when a PG leads your team in rebounds/lets the other team shoot 70% in the second half............  Ugh......
SNight322::Anytime Phil Montana trolls, I'm asking him if he wants to go fishing.
KingGeorge53::Hook 'em Homey!
mikeyp2307::One thing I love about my fellow Cav fans, we stick together. Goodnight guys. See ya next game. Go Cavs!

SNight322::Hail Mary full of grace, the lord with with thee... BLAM!
mikeyp2307::"I have to much money" translates too " I live in a trailer in montana, and i have sex with my mother for recreation"
KingGeorge53::"my  name is phil montana.   my team got beat tonight.    prepare to hear my nonsense."    -   Phil Montana.
gri400::these really made me laugh out loud, funny stuff
President R.L. Stine::so what position do u think cavs should go for in draft?
mikeyp2307::Andre Drummond will either be a huge bust or a very good center.
President R.L. Stine::hes projected 2nd so unless the cavs can get lucky
KingGeorge53::SG, SF, and C     You can't teach height so I agree with SNight
yata9arasu::Center/Shooting Guard unless MKG is available or Davis....
SNight322::Center. I basically want an angry tree.
President R.L. Stine::i agree but there aren't many centers that can make a big difference in this draft. im thinkin SG and draft either Beal from Florida or Lamb from UConn.
gri400::your welcome to take aaron gray, he isnt angry but he has the tree part down pat, he will stand there and grab any ball near him
Phil Jackson in Montana::You silly, girls. Dont comment on my posts. I laugh at Cleveland. I have to much money and dont know why anyone would live in Cleveland. LMAO!
KingGeorge53::you guys realize you're talking with a 13 y.o. that's upset his LeBron James team lost b/c LBJ cowered in the 4th and OT as usual?
yata9arasu::2 pts in 4th/OT...........................
navyctr312::homie we paid too bruh$$$ i travel the world but still love my home town
SNight322::You suck.
mikeyp2307::if you have so much money, then why are you trolling on an espn board? shouldnt you be oh i dont know, spending said money?
President R.L. Stine::nobody comment on phil jacksons post or reply to any of his comments  and it will be like he isnt even here
yata9arasu::I know....  I really want to correct him for the misuse of "to" in the sentence above............
mikeyp2307::i really want too but i cant stop myself from putting ignorant people in their place
President R.L. Stine::only way to do that is physically. not thru a computer because they hide behind their little screen
President R.L. Stine::he craves attention. if we pretend like he isnt here he will probly go insane
Phil Jackson in Montana::You Cleveland fans...Cavs, Browns, Indians....what a joke. How do you make it through unless your a re pure trash?
navyctr312::next few years gonna be some fun. how many more people will our Defense hurt again this year?
SNight322::It never dawns on you that your life has to be very lame in order to make fun of Cleveland in order to feel good about yourself.
mikeyp2307::he lives in montana. only thing they have there is horses and incest
yata9arasu::What?  Lol......
yata9arasu::Wow.....  Ellis to Bucks...........  Darn.........
yata9arasu::He is a good player....  We will see.  I wonder if he will play tomorrow........
gri400::can you see him and jennings working well together?
gri400::my thoughts exactly, i think it hurts the bucks, bogut when heathly (a big if of course) is a top 5 center who mixs help with just about anybody, ellis and jennings will be fighting for the ball
mikeyp2307::hell naw. two chuckers. bad combo
KingGeorge53::It's trading time!
navyctr312::justin blackmon at #4
cland4ever::their high on richardson and if hillis leaves it wouldnt surprise me if they take a dam running back at 4
Diamondslugz::Mos Def.
mikeyp2307::any cav fans members of the website RealCavsFans? its a really good site to use around the trade deadline.
cland4ever::i am its really good site for all of cleveland sports
Diamondslugz::Browns better sign that RT Eric Winston from Houston... we would have two premiere linemen then.
SNight322::He's in Miami, likely to sign.
cland4ever::browns wont sign a dam thing dont get your hopes up
cland4ever::yeah and the bills might sign mario williams and reggie wayne just signed same with cortland finnagin so almost all the top talent is gone now
Diamondslugz::Yeah.. if they dont make any noise this offseason his walrus $@% needs to be ousted. I mean Tampa just signed V Jackson... sign some free agents.
cland4ever::hahah i use to have high hopes but as today dawned on me of the browns doing nothing i lost all hope for the browns organization and mike holmgren is sitting their collecting a 10 mil check every year laughing
Diamondslugz::A guy can wish... can't he???
blazzbowler::what the hell is going on with cavs?? can't beat raptors?
gri400::its an awful matchup for them, happens with some teams, the cavs are better but they can't play the raps well the way these 2 teams are built
DWIGHT_HOWARD_TO_BUCKS::<b></b>
nashmvptwice::wow...this board is SOOOOOO dead................crickets.....................crickets...............crickets.............
Jeff7429::well the game is over genius.

mikeyp2307::at least their are crickets in here
President R.L. Stine::43 days until the NFL draft. i wish i could just fast forward or sleep for the next 43 days.
nashmvptwice::i dont know why sessions isnt playing more. he has better vision and irving should be a 2 guard b/c he rarely looks to pass
yata9arasu::He had double digit assists the last few games.........  He had 7 tonight.............  He can score if he wants to he can pass if he wants to.  He doesn't have better court vision than Irving......
KingGeorge53::You'd be wrong nash.    Sorry bro.
