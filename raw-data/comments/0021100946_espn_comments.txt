theclown13::Bulls only have a good record because the east is terrible!! -Sunny PAtel
poytor1::Really? The Bulls without Derek Rose most of the games against the West were 12-6 and they beat San Antonio in San Antonio easily. The Spurs had not lost a home game until then. They beat both LA teams in LA, beat the Mavs, etc..so you need to check your stats/facts first. The Bulls have a good record because they are a good team and who knows what their record would be had Rose not missed 26 of their 64 games.
Slayer Rules6::GO BULLS!! HELLL YEAH  I'm just so excited that the Bulls are not only my favorite team, but the best team in the NBA. At least until the playoffs. But the only team or maybe 2 teams that I am afraid of the Bulls playng are the Knicks. The other is Boston, but only because of Rondo, I love that guy he is awesome. Anyway, the Knicks are the most scary team in my opinion, because of Carmelo Anthony, who is playing out of his mind. I am just in awe at how he is playing lately.
pointgod6882::the Bulls will be the only team to win 50 games this year... the equivalence of 66-16 in 82 game season.
Bulldogbasketball20::if they win vs Indy and Cleveland.
For the kick out::Nice stat!
MEEENMACHINE::"I think he played a very controlled type game. He was taking care of the ball, running the offense"....Tom Thibodeau Imagine the Bulls winning w/o Rose shooting 20 times , its Revolutionary ! The starting team shot 55% from the field, it looks like the bums can shoot after all ! I would never have imagined that a point guard can get his teammates involved in the game , by being a decoy , to attract other defenders and kicking it out to the open guy, Totally Revolutionary ! Now can they do this and win ? Hmm , I think they just did !

omgliteamatch::"We still have to win out," said Rose, who acknowledged he didn't have his usual confidence driving the lane and was content to pass the ball to Deng and Hamilton.  There's no shame in letting an injury teach you how to fix your bad shooting percentage. It's better than whining about not getting superstar foul calls.
keenan1990::Deng? you realize he has a lower percentage than Rose right?
Olliebasketballs::Before it hinders your life, you should probably learn that *you* should feel shame criticizing a guy's "poor shooting" and "whining" when the absence of both of those things made him half a billion dollars and won him an MVP by age 23.  People undoubtedly laugh behind your back at everything you say since you're clearly one of those people that is wrong about everything.  It's rare to see someone's entire personality revealed by two sentences.
poodagg::wow you get more and more classless by the day!
Bullsfan737::Good thing the Chicago Bulls only lost two games in a row once this season so don't expect them to lose the next two games either they are just to good!!
Raptorchitown::Yeah but, what do the heat "fans" think?
LeoPat11::The Bulls will be scary in the Playoffs. Once Rose and Hamilton get more on the same page we will be very scary in the playoffs...
Raptorchitown::Yeah but, what do the heat "fans" think?
lebronFEARSdeng::noah almost had a triple double, and rip looked great
Raptorchitown::Yeah but, what do the heat "fans" think?
If I Knew it was that kind of party I woulda stuck my::I would sit Rose until the playoffs cause Chi is going nowhere if he's not healthy..
Raptorchitown::Yeah but, what do the heat "fans" think?

Raptorchitown::Yeah but, what do the heat "fans" think?
nba is the worst::Amazing how those 8-pt quarters can affect outcomes...  Props to the French guy for showing B. Wade about toughness!
GBM04::?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
cod4hooper::Beaubois is also Beaubois and Wade is also Wade. If Rose had a dislocated finger, he would have sat the rest of the game as well. If Dirk had, he probably would have sat. There's a reason Rose sits for EVERY LITTLE THING. Because he's their prize possession and can't risk making an injury worse. Beaubois is a lot more expendible than Wade, and though he had a good game last night, those numbers are no where near normal. If Kidd and Terry had played he probably would have gotten like 5 minutes of playing time.
nba is the worst::Rodrigue Beaubois, starting in place of Kidd, added 16 -- 10 in the final quarter -- despite playing the second half with a dislocated finger. After leaving with about 7½ minutes to go in the first half after hurting his finger guarding Ronnie Brewer, he returned minutes later to the game with his fingers taped.
nba is the worst::Beaubois had his finger dislocated too.  Unlike Wade, he came back and played!
milw-jay::weird game. seemed like neither team really cared if they won.
Jaguarcrazyboy::Great win by Bulls.. Now we've gotta just beat Indy or Clev thanks to Wash win.GO BULLS!
miketatham34::Or a Miami loss.  Hopefully the Rockets will take care of that tonight.
jlane0049::Bulls will lose home field advantage before its all said and done anyway who cares..
zo9292::jlane...you're really really stupid, you obviously don't watch very much basketball
williamgaddis::first of all, it's a court they play b-ball on - 2nd, everyone's just wrong, Heat CANNOT catch Bulls now, can only tie and lose top tie-breaker - I'm pretty sure about this
Robert156877::The Bulls would need to lose the last two and Miami would have to win the last three for the Hate to get the number one seed.  Look for that to be decided tonight because Houston has a lot more to play for than Miami does.  The only thing that is still interesting is who gets the bottom three in both conferences.  It is still possible for the Knicks to be the 6 seed, but not very likely.
williamgaddis::Bulls have clinched #1 seed haven't they? - season series tied and next tiebreaker is division record and Bulls have clinched that too   but I keep hearing everyone say they're 2 1/2 up rather than they've clinched - what's up?
Robert156877::It's not division record, though it should be.  It's if you are a division champ.  Since they are both division champs and not in the same division, it goes to conference:  1. Division winner (this criterion is applied regardless of whether the tied teams are in the same division) 2. Better record in head-to-head games 3. Higher winning percentage within division (if teams are in the same division) 4. Higher winning percentage in conference games 5. Higher winning percentage against playoff teams in own conference 6. Higher winning percentage against playoff teams in opposite conference 7. Higher point differential between points scored and points allowed
williamgaddis::the rules I checked say division record first, then conf. - though conf. makes more sense - but check the espn register of rules, it has division record as first tie-break
chisoldier::Next tie breaker after  head to head is conference record.  and then division record.  If the Bulls were to somehow lose their last two and Miami wins out, Miami would be the #1 seed.  This is because they would have the same record but Miami would have a better Conference record by one game.  This probably wont happen but that is the scenario.
williamgaddis::how? -    first tie-break - season series - tied  next tie-breaker: division record - Bulls: 11-1 - Miami: 9-4  end of story - by virtue of what is it still in air?  - (not that it matters - by the time Bulls get Indiana on Wednesday, Pacers will have clinched 3rd seed and be playing that game with 2nd string)
Jaguarcrazyboy::Gotta win one more game or Heat lose another.
chisoldier::Technically, they haven't clinched yet.  Their magic number is 1.
GBM04::Mavs play hard vs the Heat,but not the Bulls. Idiots.
Doneebear::The Bulls won in spite of the ESPN cheerleaders who called this game!  This was an "in your face" moment for the Bulls since ESPN keeps talking about the trouble the Bulls are in---well I would say a 10 point win over the Mavs proves the Bulls are doing fine and still the top team!  Take that ESPN!
ahwickman::Honestly with the refs, you think the game is being played in Dallas.  At some point you have to believe in David stern and the conspiracy theories. He want's to give whatever edge he can to Miami and have it go through South Beach.
jlane0049::If your team is playing that darn good should it matter where they play? south beach , chicago or anywhere, I bet It wouldnt matter where the Spurs would play right now  they would beat anyone incliuding the Heat or the Bulls..............NUFF SAID
Miaminati::If not stern than the refs and everybody in the media are bandwagon fans and most like they gambling against the bulls and picking the heat over every team

Bullsfan737::Rose will get MVP in the finals after they beat San Antonio 4-3 in the series..you heard it here folks!!
Vaquero In The House::Bulls-fan - It's very easy to sit at the keyboard &amp; write a bunch of crap but let me put it into prospective.  Do you seriously believe the Spurs will bow down to the Bulls if they meet in the finals?  The real MVP of the finals will be Tony Parker &amp; he plays for the Spurs.  Parker's been there &amp; done that, can anyone say the same about Rose?  If so, how many final MVP does he have or better yet championships under his belt?  For your information &amp; because your team hasn't won a championship since Michael Jordan retired, Rose is not 100 percent healthy &amp; chances are if he's limps into the playoff there's a very strong possibility the Bulls will not be representing the West.  The playoffs is a different beast &amp; brings the best out of players.  The level of competition is twice as high as in the regular season, so if Rose is not healthy chances are he's not going to get much rest once the playoffs start.  The short season &amp; schedule had the Spurs playing numerous back-to-back-to-back games, this favors the Spurs during the playoffs, Coach Pop has done an excellent job of knowing when to rest his players.  If the Spurs stay healthy, (I say "if" because Ginobilli broke his hand in last season's final game while Parker limped in with a shoulder injury), so if the Spurs stay healthy there's no other team that can stop them......just being realistic!
keenan1990::I would put all my money on the Bulls not representing the west. My logic is loosely based on the fact that they are in the East and not the West.
Bullsfan737::I thought I spelled that wrong thanks bud!!
Bullsfan737::They haven't lost 2 games in a row more than once this year and that bolds well for them in the play-offs, can't wait for the domination!!
keenan1990::it's "bodes'...sorry..GO BULLS!!!!
Bullsfan737::It's their year bud and you know it, your just trying to come up with as many reasons as you can that they won't but you know the truth!!

blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::HEAT WILL TAKE THE BULLS TO THE CLEANERS
keenan1990::what ya a fool..yea they will..second round $@%!$@%

keenan1990::yea....we know
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::ROSE&gt;CP3 HE WINS EVERYTIME THEY PLAY
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::WHAT IS IT THEN
Mike60126::thats not a stat thats a win...
keenan1990::MEEENMACHINE  Rose holds the ball 90% of the time he is in the game ....   Nash does the same ...........   Nash averages 11 assists per game , to a team that would be 3rd stringers on the Bulls.   Rose averages 8 assists per game , to 4 or 5 specialists who are ranked top 10 at what they do, why ?   Nash shoots 54% , Rose shoots 43%..Why doesn't Rose pass more , if his teammates shoot a better percentage then him ?     also this^^^^^^^^^
Mike60126::so quit bringing up rose shooting 46%
keenan1990::head to head?
keenan1990::if you don't want stats what do you want?
candycandyYOU::damnn they need this  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj60UBZmX8c
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::PUT ROSE ON THE CLIPS THEY WOULD BE WORSE  PUT CP3 ON THE BULLS THEY WOULD WIN A RING

blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::BULLSFAN GO DRINK YOUR BABY BOTTLE

53Kevin::if that's the case moran,why every time Rose goes up against CP3,Rose out performs him?
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::GRIFFIN WOULD NOT BE GETTING LOBS OR SWEET PASSES. CP3 IS SETTING HIM UP AND THE ENTIRE TEAM.
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::LOL
Mike60126::in that case, don't put CP3 on the bulls and Rose on the Clippers and IMAGINE what would happen... moron
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::GOT TO WORK WITH THE PERSONELL YOU HAVE
Mike60126::OH NO not the lobs! anything but the lobs!! LOL bulls play real ball, they don't mess with that alley oop ish
Mike60126::prove it
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::MEEENMACHINE Rose holds the ball 90% of the time he is in the game ....  Nash does the same ...........  Nash averages 11 assists per game , to a team that would be 3rd stringers on the Bulls.  Rose averages 8 assists per game , to 4 or 5 specialists who are ranked top 10 at what they do, why ?   Nash shoots 54% , Rose shoots 43%..Why doesn't Rose pass more , if his teammates shoot a better percentage then him ?  RESPECT
2435kalen::for one, nash averages half the points rose does. besides that, they're different players. do you honestly think nash could take any decent defender off the dribble? that's not his game. is nash a better passer? sure. he's one of the best ever. and he's a dead eye shooter when he's open (which is the only time he takes a shot). their respective teams need different things from rose and nash. comparing them on the terms you just described is unfair and idiotic.
MEEENMACHINE::Is it easier to pass the ball to the open guy  for a dunk or is it easier to rebound the ball off a launch for a put back ? If Rose drove the ball to pass , he'd avg. 15 assists a game .  A smart point guard anticipates help defenders cheating over and passes it to the guy they just left. You watch  Dallas in the Playoffs ? Did Dirk decide to throw it at the basket , when the double came , so that his teammates would get a rebound , or he got happy , because one of his teammates was left wide open ?
2435kalen::if nash took the shots rose takes, he wouldn't shoot 54%. nash only shoots when left wide open. the bulls offense needs rose to drive. all the time. it creates space, it creates putbacks for noah and gibson, it forces the opponents defense to concentrate on one player, leading to higher shooting % for the rest of the team. this is obvious to anyone who watches the games instead of looking at a stat line.
MEEENMACHINE::Exactly my point..If Nash shoots 54% , he still averages 11 assists to guys who shoot worse then him...Rose takes more shots at the expense of players who are superior to him in the 1/2 court offensive set . Who would you want to finish around the basket in the 1/2 court set ? Rose, Noah , Gibson or Boozer ? Who would you want to take the 3 point shot ? Deng , Korver , Watson or Rose ? Who would you want to take an elbow jumper ? Gibson , Korver, Watson , Hamilton, Boozer or Rose ? I want Rose to be first on the fast break and last on all the rest !  He takes way to much shots of all the other stuff..W/O breakaway layups and dunks he'd be a 30% shooter in the 1/2 court set !
keenan1990::seriously..4 or 5 specialist in the top 10? top 10 in what?
MEEENMACHINE::Is Korver on the floor every 4th quarter at the end of every tight game ? A little math for the genius ...If Rose averages 36 minutes per game and Korver averages 23 minutes per game and the game is 48 minutes long , is it conceivable that Korver played with Rose beyond, what you,  the Bulls watcher , is saying ? Since they play 59 minutes total ..59 - 48 = 11 , 11 minutes of 23 minutes is 48%...So no matter what, he plays with Rose 48% of the time at minimum and the likelihood it is 75% of the time !
MEEENMACHINE::Forgot Noah has the 8th best(15th overall)shooting percentage for a center !
keenan1990::damn..thatd make sense if Rip had played more than half a season..also if hamilton is a top 10 jump shooter why does he have a lower percentage than Rose for career?
2435kalen::and hamilton has played how many games? and rose is on the floor with korver how often? oh, right, you don't actually watch the bulls play.
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::YOU KILLIN MEEN
MEEENMACHINE::Boozer top 10 ..Shooting percentage in the league 53% Korver top 10 3 point shooters  Hamilton top 10 jump shooters in the game  Deng top 10 small forwards in the game
Mike60126::its great when you run out of things to say, so you post someone else's. ORIGINAL. btw he does hold the ball 90% of the time he's in the came, its actually 45%
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::NEVER RUN OUT OF THINGS, IM JUST POSTING REAL STATEMENTS
keenan1990::I'll take a guy who is averaging 3 more points and only 1 less assist any day.
keenan1990::pure stats bro
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::ROSE&gt;CP3 LOL
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::WHO ARE U REFERRING TO
keenan1990::Rose..and CP3...Rose is the one averaging that.
Bullsfan737::Rose- 29 Pts 1 Reb 4 Ast 1 Blk and Parker- 11 Pts 9 Ast 6 Reb and a 96-89 win for the Bulls in San Antonio!!
Bullsfan737::I'm the whole Chicago team fanboy
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::OK ROSE FANBOY
Bullsfan737::This was a game they played this season..what are you talking about!!
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::WOW A GAME OVER TITLE RINGS?
53Kevin::Don;t change now punk,blake_griffin_is_a_flopper,You did'nt bring up rings when you were saying your dumb @$$ comment about switching Rose and CP3,and about lob passes,now did you?

Mike60126::All you haters are on the board cuz you're scared of your team getting whooped by the Bulls
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::NEED THE RING I GUESS
Mike60126::about to get it
Mike60126::Beat every team in the NBA at least once and is on their way to contend for another Championship, also posted the best defensive efficiency and point differential and rebounding this season in the league, second in assists and first in points allowed. they have the reigning MVP and COY and have three veterans who have won championships and a coach that has one as well.
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::WHAT HAVE THE BULLS DONE, CALM DOWN MAN
53Kevin::What has your team done moran,bgiaf?
2435kalen::what has anyone done, really? the mavs are old and let their defensive anchor go. the spurs are old and have been checking out early in the playoffs lately. the lakers have been a roller coaster all year. the thunder are unproven. the lebrons choked hard last year. the bulls, despite numerous injuries to their best players, have maintained the best record in the league all year. you calm down, captain caps-lock.
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::MEEENMACHINE 43%... 44% last year....40% in the Playoffs ..Because he listened to dumb MF's who say "Rose gots to take more shots come playoff time , there is no one else who can shoot it " ..So he increased his shot output ...And decreased his shooting percentage...  His team collectively shot the ball at 45%....People can't separate the difference of a player who can create to pass to his teammates , to a person creating just to take his own shot. NICE
Mike60126::Everyone &gt; blake_griffin_is_a_flopper

blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::ALL DAY

Mike60126::nahhh
ThirdQuarter::Does anyone know how to post videos to facebook!?
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::ONLY BULLS FANS WOULD EVEN PUT ROSE ON CP3 LEVEL
MEEENMACHINE::Rose holds the ball 90% of the time he is in the game .... Nash does the same ........... Nash averages 11 assists per game , to a team that would be 3rd stringers on the Bulls. Rose averages only 8 assists per game , to 4 or 5 specialists who are ranked top 10 at what they do, why ?  Nash shoots 54% , Rose shoots 43%..Why doesn't Rose pass more , if his teammates shoot a better percentage then him ?
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::NOT HE DOESNT CP3 IS THE MAN
keenan1990::ok..........troll
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::OF COURSE NASH AND CP3 ARE TRUE PG
keenan1990::nash is CP3 looks for his shot way too much to be what you consider a true pg
keenan1990::you putting CP3 on the same level as nash as far as pure pg goes?
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::ROSE JUST GETS STATS FOR HIMSELF. PGS ARE RONDO,NASH,CP3, DWILL
2435kalen::so you're going to trash rose for his shooting %, then tout rondo as some sort of beacon of great play? rondo shoots worse than an above average 12 year old.
Mike60126::OK JUST KEEP TALKING OUT OF YOUR A$$
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::DEFINE A PG, ROSE IS A SG
53Kevin::Then why did Rose have more assist (16)when he went head up vs Paul.Paul did'nt have that manyBlake?
Mike60126::lol when Kobe or D.Wade has 8 or more assists people think thats crazy, man i wonder how Rose does it
2435kalen::well crap, a shooting guard averaging 8 assists a game...that's pretty impressive.
Mike60126::rose average 22 points and 8 assist a game. thats a point guard moron. he also starts at that position...
Mike60126::actually NBA Gm's put Rose above every one else. they think he is the best pg in the league, look it up
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::WHAT ROSE SHOOTING % THIS YEAR
MEEENMACHINE::43%... 44% last year....40% in the Playoffs ..Because he listened to dumb MF's who say "Rose gots to take more shots come playoff time , there is no one else who can shoot it " ..So he increased his shot output ...And decreased his shooting percentage... His team collectively shot the ball at 45%....People can't separate the difference of a player who can create to pass to his teammates , to a person creating just to take his own shot.
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::NOT GOOD
2435kalen::i didn't say it was good. but he also gets to the line on a consistent basis.
2435kalen::.436
Bullsfan737::Rose- 29 Pts. 8 Reb 16 Ast and a steal and Paul- 15 Pts 4 Reb 14 Ast and 4 steals in the only meeting this season and a 114-101 win for the Bulls..looks like Rose got him that game!!
keenan1990::also there are few pg's in the league that Rose does better against than CP3
Bullsfan737::When he's healthy he is hard to beat and he still is the reigning MVP
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::CROSS OVERS ARE NICE TO WATCH BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH MAKING SOMEBODY BETTER
Mike60126::Iverson wasn't on a championship caliber team, rose is
Mike60126::he is actually 2000 points 600 assist and 300 blocks and one season is pretty monstrous, plus he crosses the crap out of CP3, Rondo and Westbrick
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::OMG REALLY JEEZ ROSE MUST BE A MONSTER
Thomasg2488::Rose needs to be a SG so Watson can be the PG. And he needs to get a jump shot if he wants to stay in the NBA much longer
2435kalen::yeah, rose is definitely in danger of losing his job in the NBA because he isn't the best shooter.  BTW, his shooting % this year is the worst of his career, and he's STILL shooting better than one kobe bean bryant, who morons are still talking about as a possible MVP candidate.
2435kalen::and he's been working on his jump shot. and BTW, plenty of people drove to the paint every time when they were young and lived to have long, successful NBA careers. dumba.s.s.
Thomasg2488::He needs a jump shot so he doesn't have to drive to the paint every time and risk more injury. Dumb.a.s.s
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::40%
Boshosaurus::A 40% jumpshot isnt bad
Mike60126::rose has a jump shot, jesus christ you guys must be running out of ammo
Thomasg2488::Yeah, if you count bricking it every shot as a jump shot.
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::HAHA SPEAK YO MIND BOY
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::ROSE IS A WANNABE IVERSON. IVERSON DOESNT HAVE A RING. 6'0  CHUCKING GUARDS DONT LEAD TEAMS TO RINGS
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::ISIAH AND ROSE DO NOT COMPARE.
2435kalen::why don't they? because rose is bigger, has a faster first step, and neither was all that great a jump shooter?
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::LOL IM COMAPRING ROSE AND AI. TWO CHUCKERS
Mike60126::okay neither do inversion and rose so....
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::^WINDY CINDY ABUSE
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::6'3 IS STILL SMALL IN TERMS OF NBA PLAYERS, WHEN WAS THE LAST CHUCKING PG TO LEAD HIS TEAM TO A TITLE
2435kalen::isiah thomas is lucky to call himself 5'11. he liked to shoot. he was a point guard.
Mike60126::shut up, your argument sucks
2435kalen::rose is 6'3 and made of muscle. iverson weighed less than i do (i'm an out of shape 5'8 and 165)
Rick-Da-Villain::Rose looked alittle rusty tonite ..that's why da bulls need him before playoff time
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::LOL GET REAL THE BULLS CANT BEAT MIAMI
2435kalen::exactly. hamilton surprisingly has hit the ground running. if he and rose are clicking come playoff time, all y'all heat fans are gonna finish this season even sadder than last.
Bullsfan737::Bulls&gt;Clippers
Bullsfan737::N
Bullsfan737::Now you are being rediculous!!
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::AM I DENYING THAT IM NOT EVEN A CLIPPER FAN  BUT CP3&gt;ROSE IN A LAND SLIDE
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::ITS A LANDSLIDE CP3 MAKES SCRUBS LOOK GOOD AND HE IS BETTER IN THE CLUTCH. HE CAN ALSO SCORE WHEN HE WANTS BUT HE IS A MAGICIAN RUNNING THE SHOW
2435kalen::they're different players. both are great. paul is a maestro...he controls the pace of the game better than anyone. rose gets to the basket at will. he's a step faster than everyone. to say one is greater than the other, especially declaring it to be a landslide, is moronic.
Rick-Da-Villain::Blake Griffin is overrated ...can we all agree on this mavs/bulls section..
2435kalen::he's overrated by people who don't watch basketball outside of highlights. anyone who pays attention knows that while he puts up solid numbers, he still needs to consistently hit a 16 foot jumper and free throws before he can really be considered a top player. and i could do without him staring down anyone who happens to be in the vicinity when he dunks. it's childish.
Rick-Da-Villain::Ok..but his fans shouldn't be on here dissing da bulls on this section ..
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::JOHN WALL COULD TAKE OVER FOR ROSE IN CHICAGO OR KYRIE IRVING
2435kalen::wall is a good player. irving could be great. rose is already great and (provided he stays healthy) getting better. you have no point.
Bullsfan737::now your being assinine
Rick-Da-Villain::You need method idiot
kane smythe::remind you hes top 10 in assists.
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::'
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::IS LEBRON IN THERE ALSO
kane smythe::idk or care.
Bullsfan737::Exactly and he had 8 assists today in 31 minutes!!
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::BECAUSE HES INJURED ROSE IS A CHUCKER
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::ALL DERICK ROSE DOES IS GET HIS STATS UP, CHUCKS AND CHUCKS, HE DOESNT MAKE PEOPLE BETTER. HE IS JUST LUCKY TO BE ON A WELL COACHED TEAM
Bullsfan737::Why do you come on the Bulls page if you only have hate for Rose it's foolish!!
kane smythe::cus wer the shi duh ppl coming out to see how we do
blake_griffin_is_a_flopper::REMIND YOU HE IS A PG
