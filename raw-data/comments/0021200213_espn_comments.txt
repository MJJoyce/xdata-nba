DetWingsFan96::too bad we are losing our next 2 games
Nash_Owns_LA::I have never been so embarrassed to be a Suns fan in my entire life
t casey::Don't worry. It gets better.
knowlto::Stuckey actually looks decent coming off the bench!  Wonders never cease.
retiredat23::I'm so glad Jerebko isn't playing, he's terrible!!
FREE_TEBOW::Tebow?????
Kobelies247::Atleast you didnt lose to the Wizards!
brother carl loves jesus::Charlie V off the bench! Way to establish Home Court Guys. Go Pistons!!!
Bmarleys420::Started using a bet system named sportsbettingstar. Ive made around $3,000 a month profit using this system. You can find the system on google by searching sports betting system. If you bet on sports at all you gotta check this out.
verfielderbrera::Happy to see a Charlie V Sighting tonight. Very Surprising Jerebko isn't Playing very well. Charlie v Has Taken his minutes and is doing things with them. Great Win for the Pistons. It has to be a confidence booster to win by 40 against any team in the NBA.
Bmarleys420::Using a bet system called sportsbettingstar. Making between 2-3k a month profits following this system. If you search sports betting system on google you will find more about it there.
Jimmy45795::40 point loss to Detroit? One of those great mysterys
Arbyrick::The Suns will do as per usual. Play just good enough to not make the lottery and continue to struggle.....
wustm1dj::so you are saying the Suns will make the playoffs?  The only teams that don't make the lottery are the teams that are in the playoffs.
ozob37::Not really if you've been following the Pistons... They're certainly not great, but they are getting better and gelling as a team. You have to admit that the Suns are pretty crappy too...
bamberg1977::Pistons have playing really good ball since about the 6th game of the season, when they got blown out @ Houston. Ever since then, they've been a different team. But they continued to lose close games to good teams for a while and their record looks terrible. Very difficult schedule early.
TigerMichLion111::Detroit plays the best team in basketball "right now" next!! Should be fun, if pistons beat them then I'll be a believer but doubt they beat memphis
ozob37::Nah, probably not. But I hope they battle hard.
TigerMichLion111::SoWhyYouMadBro that's right! the East is wide open and weak. Detroit could be the "indiana" of the Playoffs and I like them a whole lot better than I did Indy last Season 1 Hour Ago · Like · Quote · Flag  Haha I have to disagree with this because Detroit is nowhere near what Indiana was last year, if pistons make playoffs they are prolly getting swept out in the first round
portans1936::How do you lose by 40 points to anybody let alone Detroit?
felipe_elbig::charlie have a career high 48 point in a game but you probably didn't knew that
Detroit Everything::Kuester's first year when everyone was injured. But one guy going off for 40 doesn't always equal a win.
Philip3664::Well...did you ever stop and think that maybe they are not as bad as their record reflects?
Detroit Everything::I can't wait till people stop asking this
Janet_Reno_Dance_Party::DEEEEEEEEEETROIT BASKETBALLLLLLL..our team is terrible lol but hey they r fun to watch
Detroit Everything::the season is young, so is the team. I think they are getting better as they go along. We woulda had a lot more wins by now if they played better 4th quarters. Also need to learn how to win on the road. Should be a really fun season!
sweetlew09::How do you lose by 40 to the pistons?!?!?
felipe_elbig::a new coach that is what the pistons need
jdarin987::experience is what they need, and they will have it soon.
Janet_Reno_Dance_Party::04 pistons? lol
Detroit Everything::A few more wins and people will stop asking this stupid question
tampaAsian1234::HOLY $@%! HAHAHAHAHAHA
Jrange378::Just bought tickets vs the clippers in december. Lets go Detroit!
JimDetroitFan95::Nice game Detroit.
texasluva::Wow. When you get beat by the Pistons by 40 points that about says it all. A Royal a$$ kicking.
XstreamINsanity::Yep, a Royal a$$ kicking at The Palace.  :)
Detroit Everything::i just have so much more respect for Stuckey. He deserves credit for this team changing pace by volunteering to be the 6th man. I know it's wishful thinking, but this may be the start of something huge. It kind of reminds me of the OKC formula but a lot cheaper lol (and obviously not as star studded).
DetWingsFan96::ya i hated how the year before we traded billups, everyone thought stuckey was going to be amazing because he did good in the playoffs after replacing billups when he was injured. hes not terrible or amazing so he is an average player
ozob37::So glad he quit trying to be "the man." He can get a lot more respect and help the team better from the bench.
ozob37::Funny punchline on the voice over of the highlights... "If you had the Suns and 39, you LOSE. Pistons win by 40."
SoWhyYouMadBro::I'm out ...Great win again pistons and keep ya head up' it's a start of good things to come. peace!
JimDetroitFan95::So pmsj, is your catcher going to the Yankees?
ThirdComing...::I'm out....GL going forward Pistons and I hope you make the playoffs! Never been a fan of the Pistons but I just want to see Detroit sports succeed....  Btw..Can't wait for April in the D! Goo Tigers!
JimDetroitFan95::You confuse me..... Boston and Tigers and..................  I don't get it.
DakWolves::Wolves fan, thank you Suns for takin our garbage out to the trash cans for us
Detroit Everything::u guys love #2 picks
Florida Swamp::Magic &gt; Pistons
Janet_Reno_Dance_Party::hes a sports reporter for his blog
zach strauch::Why is a damn magic fan on a pistons-suns board. U must really not have anything better to do.
Philip3664::Ok why are you here??
SoWhyYouMadBro::I would think about taking you seriously but you're reppin' a damn Swamp? c'mon bro lol
SoWhyYouMadBro::@ Florida Swamp No Sir I'm just an unbiased Sports reporter from New York. (non ESPN affiliated)  and an unbiased Fan of the NBA
Detroit Everything::I'm in florida right now
Philip3664::*You're
MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00::*you're
Florida Swamp::Your not from Florida
zach strauch::We should trade tay while we can.
Detroit Everything::who wants to take a gander that someone is making some coaching decisions for Dougie Frank
ThirdComing...::Charlie V playing well for the Pistons? Wtf I thought he was amnestied..haha
hokienation135::<b> Fire Gentry</b>
PrinceofDetroit28::he has never been a good coach.
SoWhyYouMadBro::I like Investing and I'm a betting Man. I've been making predictions with a high success rate for a very long time. Detroit Fans tell the haters and trolls to F off. I've been convinced since Day 1 that you guys are gonna make the Playoffs...and once you're in anything can happen.  Let these teams keep "sleeping" on Detroit...trust me it's gonna cost em'
dickerson1268::Detroit sucks. Do not let wins over Phoenix Portland (who jus tlost to the wizards) and Toronto make you think they are playoff contenders. 25-30 wins tops
DetWingsFan96::you forgot that we beat the celtics by 20+ points
ThirdComing...::I hope the Pistons make the playoffs...I think they can get the 8th seed if they can continue to play good basketball
denn19641::Hope to beat them so we can lure SF before trade deadline.  I don't think we are bound for lottery anymore.
zach strauch::I believe we can beat a lot of the eastern conference teams(except Miami) but we can definately beat Indy, Chicago, Boston, Philly, and so on. Eastern conf is weak this season
SoWhyYouMadBro::that's right! the East  is wide open and weak. Detroit could be the "indiana" of  the Playoffs and I like them a whole lot better than I did Indy last Season
SoWhyYouMadBro::they will..nothing in life is gauranteed but I'll take my chances with Detroit
Florida Swamp::Pistons have yet to prove they are better than the Magic
JimDetroitFan95::The "terrible" Pistons played pretty good tonight, so I don't think we are bad.  They played a great game tonight.  How are you doing pmsj?
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::Pretty good, my Bulls bounced back from a horrific defeat on Monday with a big W tonight over Dallas. How about you?
JimDetroitFan95::Nice.  The Pistons are a work in progress, but a 40 point win is nice.
Peyton Mannings Sexy Jaguar::What the HELL happened here?
AdamFinesse::Neuva was feelin' it!
ThirdComing...::Lol same thing I was thinking...
SoWhyYouMadBro::The Pistons are better than their record would suggest. this might just be the spark they need.  Tonight win was not luck...just a team coming together that may surprise the shi* out of people by mid Season
ThirdComing...::Wow...Detroit playing well....Ever since they beat my C's, they've been on fire
zach strauch::Suns looked like a dead pile of crap from the beginning of the 2nd quarter till the end of the game. GO PISTONS!
the royal spam::what the heck is up with Charlie V... somebody light a fire under his bench... his 3-point shooting is like, where have you been Joe DiMaggio
felch8::No offense Piston fans, you're not that good, but the Suns are that bad...
zach strauch::It has sucked being a pistons fan for the past 4 years.
felch8::Sounds about right...Knight is a gonna be something...sux being a Suns fan...
cpajaysmith::Trust me, we know we're not good. Heck, we're not even average. I think we're a slightly below average basketball team. But, they're much better than most people give credit for. They should win about 35 games this season, not the 25 that most "experts" predicted.
Florida Swamp::Bad at playing away games
JohnsonnnL::How is this team 5-11
zach strauch::I believe we can make a strong case for the 7 or 8 seed.
JetWing34::They defeated Toronto, Portland, and then Phoenix tonight. Starting Singler made a real difference. Perfect player to start off the bench after a god-awful first 8 games.
Philip3664::If Frank goes with the starting lineup he is putting out there now, we could easily have 8 or 9 wins right now.
PrinceofDetroit28::They had a difficult schedule early also. The hardest part of any schedule is the west coast trip. Since that they have played much better.
Detroit Everything::ya very true. But even when returning home they had teams down by double digits, but just couldn't finish. Maybe learning to play with each other has also taught them to close games better.
cpajaysmith::^ This
Detroit Everything::allow me to copy the post I made earlier:   5-3 since singler became a starter. Not a coincidence people. Frank didn't change his lineup until becoming 0-8, and at that point it was by force since Stuckey was sick..    Frank was gonna go back to his same lineup but Stuckey said, no coach let me come off the bench.
dhocky77::uhhh...what the hell pistons?? play terrible for 4 seasons than do this lol
JetWing34::Detroit is just a lousy team after six consecutive seasons to the conference championship (won twice, one NBA Finals title). The misery continues, but that win there delivered swift judgement.
E_Fonz::Glad that frank figured out that the pistons can't hang when they play run-and-gun......and got back to defense first mentality
JimDetroitFan95::If the Pistons continue to play well, they deserve fans in the seats at home.  Earn it Detroit.
Detroit Everything::maybe thats why they kept pouring the points late in the 4th. I can see Gores being like, ok I want a blow out. That way it's newsworthy in the morning and people can start buying tickets.
JimDetroitFan95::I think at this point they deserve more fan support.  They are playing well at home.
ESPN.com is my life::looks like a rough nite for my suns. missed the game. glad it did.
JetWing34::Phoenix lost to a mediocre Detroit team by FORTY POINTS. Unbelievable basketball by the Pistons! This reminds me of the time Rasheed and Rip Hamilton played for Detroit.
philsense::Anyone hoping that some team will bite on Charlie V?
Detroit Everything::it depends.
PrinceofDetroit28::I think that would be everyone.
Niners4Lyfe5::Suicide &gt; Losing to Detroit by 40
Philip3664::If you say so...
