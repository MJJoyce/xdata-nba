drftw42134::hey well watch next year when the Nets blow out the hawks and sweep the series
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Highly unlikely.
nahhb::nba draft, all nba players are eligible where would u guys put deron williams? this site had him 14th, seemed too low http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/
jtyree0226::3-14 shooting. Nice job Gerald wallace and nice job Nets for trading for him.
AIadvocate::You are better off with Billy Jean King as your GM
AIadvocate::LOVE THAT BILLY KING HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  FU NJ HAHAHAHA YOU GOT STUCK WITH BILLY K

KORNETS::WE GOT A FANTASTIC CHANCE AT ENDING UP AT LEAST 4TH WORST MEANING WE HAVE A VERY SOLID STATISTICAL SHOT TO HAVE ONE OUR OUR PING PONG BALLS DRAWN OUT OF THE FULL 3 "RANDOM" DRAWS.  THEY RUN THE RANDOM BALL POPPER THREE TIMES TO FILL OUT THE TOP 3 TEAMS TO SELECT PICKS 1, 2, &amp; 3 AND THEN THE REST OF THE PICKS IN THE DRAFT GO BY TEAM WITH WORST RECORD AND SO ON.  ONLY 3 TEAMS CAN MAKE A MOVE THATS IT.  IF NETS END UP 4TH THE BEST CASE IS 1ST PICK AND THE WORST CASE IS 7TH PICK. RARE, BUT WE (PORTLAND) CAN BE 7TH IF THE THREE PING PONG DRAWINGS DRAW 3 OF THE REMAINING LOTTERY TEAMS WHICH ALL HAVE BETTER RECORDS THEN US (HIGHER SEEDED LIKE 5,6,7 END UP 1,2,3 UN PICKS RESPECTIVELY).  iF THAT HAPPENED THAN TEAM THE DRAFT ORDER WOULD NOW BE, BY WORST TO BEST USING THE EXAMPLE ABOVE: 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,16, 17, 18, 19, 20, ETC AND SO ON.  NBA 101 FOR ROOKIESFANS AND THOSE WHO JUST DIDNT KNOW IT ALL!
G E O R G I A---912---DAWGS::Things I learned from ESPN User KORNETS  1)  Fans of a 15-34 team are shocked when they lose, and actually think other teams are "inferior" to them. Pushing 20 games under .500 guy. What's so surprising about losing? The NETS are GARBAGE.
AtlantaWarrior77::wow atl is going to have a back- to back - to back
KORNETS::I CANT BELIEVE THE NETS BLEW THIS GAME AGAINST THE SCRUB PLAYERS ON THE HAWKS!! THIS IS GETTING EMBARRASSING NO MATTER HOW INJURED WE'VE BEEN ALL SEASON, NOW IS THE HEALTHIEST WE'VE BEEN MINUS BROOK AND SOME SCRUBS AND WE LOSE TIGHT GAMES TO INFERIOR TEAMS NON STOP!!! I CANT TAKE THIS DRAMA!!! DWILL WILL START SECOND GUESSING HIMSELF UNLESS LOPEZ COMES BACK AND THE TEAM SMOKES TO THE FINISH LINE SHOWING HOW BIG A DIF HAVING THAT SECOND STAR SCORER PLUS BROOK ADDS A BIG AND STRONG 7 FOOTER DOWN LOW AND CAN BE ABSOLUTELY DOMINANT AT TIMES, PARTICULARLY ON OFFENSE BUT HE GOES OFF ON BLOCKS SOMETIMES TOO!!  I TRULY BELIEVE A FULL NETS LINEUP OF:
AtlantaWarrior77::that is ebarrasing are center was collins, and he had nothing in the net
Rezo201::And the losing streak continues, nice.
drftw42134::The Nets should just lose every game and not try. Deron Williams is going to leave anyways because he wants a team that wins and even not winning these games will cause him to change his mind and go to Dallas.
gr82bAbulldawg::For the last time, Deron is NOT going to Dallas. Why would he go to a team with three aging former superstars, whose best championship role players (JJ Barea, Tyson Chandler) are gone??? Dallas is a sinking ship &amp; they're not coming back to shore anytime soon...
gr82bAbulldawg::Deron is not overrated. Field goal percentages are down for MOST players in the NBA this season because of the intense schedule. The NBA has never had this type of schedule. His fg% in past seasons have been slightly less than 50% or above.
KORNETS::NOT IF WE LOSE ENOUGH TO GET THE NUMBER 1 PICK AND GET DAVIS BABY!!
23germany::deron is overrated. 22p with 41%fg and 4 turnovers per is just not that good
Ramonster7::15 points in the 4th for the Nets, yup, they are tanking it lmao
mrclarion::Looks like another win for the Hawks.  Way to keep beating on the bottom feeders.
mrclarion::Nope. Just the what you need to do to make the playoffs.
RonoSL550::What? You think they should lose to the bottom feeders?
RonoSL550::Overtime?
drftw42134::Hawks will win don't worry. Nets have choked the last 3 games in the final 2 minutes. I wouldn't be suprised if Hawks win
metropolitanfanforever::we need the third pick at least folks to keep it after that debacle of a trade for Wallace
metropolitanfanforever::More ping pong balls!!
RonoSL550::JJ looks sleepy...
wadenba3::Josh Smith playing like a MVP recently!
drftw42134::If the Nets are actually trying to tank the season then why the $@%! do they try in the beginning? Why not just get blown out every game? Because I am through with this 4th quarter crap. The last 3 games, they had the lead and they choke in the 4th quarter.
Ramonster7::drftw42134 - If the Nets are actually trying to tank the season then why the $@%! do they try in the beginning? Why not just get blown out every game? Because I am through with this 4th quarter crap. The last 3 games, they had the lead and they choke in the 4th quarter.  choke is aka tanking it.
the myth.::57 comments lmao
DonTeflon357::D will ballin?
gr82bAbulldawg::i'm watching! &amp; i must say it's fun to watch D will play. but he's the only one making any effort on BOTH ends of the floor
J-SMOOVE2036::this is the best Hawks team we have ever had.  when we get horford, zaza, vlad, etc. back, we can do some damage in the playoffs.
AtlantaWarrior77::hawks beat the nets 106, then 105, and then 106 lol
romeo8880::Atlanta Hawks, the worst winning record team in the NBA.
jaykel0621::I agree!!!!   They suck
aa1401::u suck
Ramonster7::it's official, the nets are obviously trying to tank the season.  free wins against the nets!
AtlantaWarrior77::injuries are killing the hawks
slowmow12::I am board on this bored. I am going to the knockerbockers game...
redemption50::Is anybody actually watching this game?
aftern9ne::I am occasionally glancing at the score here. Can't be bothered to watch the Hawks screw up their season.
slowmow12::I am... not closely though...

We_R_ALL_FaGGoTs_::hawks are one of the most inconsistent teams i swear..  NJ sucks.. this shouldnt even be this close
lil_chip87::lets go hawks
We_R_ALL_FaGGoTs_::hawks gonna find a way to lose to these bums
tonygr199031::any links

Anthony A70::lollol

PIDI9093::Let's go Hawks!
Viktorae6784::I think the Hawks are content to just make the playoffs every year.
me_destruit::Ugh, Collins starting at center...should start Ivan instead. He might be giving up size, but he can actually score and make it up and down the court.
drftw42134::Anyone got link to this game?
littlebabylalash::Is Marvin back
BrendanColts18::Another great game for Josh Smith tonight.
Rezo201::Let's keep the losing streak going!
drftw42134::No man; we can't take a risk on getting the top draft pick. We can get 4th so we don't want Portland to get it. We have to win games now.
