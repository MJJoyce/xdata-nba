mark::I guess Anthony Bennett is no Lebron James when it comes to overall #1 picks!
dan::what is happening to kyrie irving?  he is missing a lot of shots, limited assist and lots of turnovers. bynum is done already and ready to retire.   it seems the cavs is a forsaken team after the lebron departure.
John G::Amazingly, only Indiana is significantly ahead of the Bulls in the conference...
J.Singh::Why is it that when Irving goes up against a good team, he doesn't do ANYTHING and when he's up against a team like the 76er's he drops 39 points. He needs to start getting more consistent or his #$%$ is going to be out of Cleveland faster than Lebrons!
Shi::Let us see if Cleveland's defense keep them in the game, since the offense is again awful in the 1Q. 31.6% is even below their seasonal average, that is when Bennett on the bench the whole time.
Isaac::Once Rose adjusts to the pressure and starts limiting turnovers, the bulls are a legitimate title contender.  Along with the heat, pacers, spurs, thunder, and clippers.
none::Bulls are not a title contender, they need a coach who can develop his bench, this clown will not let james play and he is a pretty good defender and shooter, he should be good for 8-10 minutes on some nights.
michael::Anthony bennett another #1 pick bust!!
willie::Bennett is an Eddy Curry in the making. C'mon Brown, work his #$%$ out.
David::When will you Rose zealots learn hes NOT the answer??? The guy gets hurt walking out of a shower
