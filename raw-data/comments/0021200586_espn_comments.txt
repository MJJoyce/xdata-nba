adphill2::losing by under ten points for the magic... even with a sucky draft class it's better to have a top 5 pick than a top 20 pick... Keep losing close one with a sprinkle of a hard fought win in there occasionally! Go Magic!
xfactor1997::Orlando sucks!!!!!!!!
vidoMNE::Vucevic will be in top 3 C next year..
dwade grater den jordan 5.0::AAA &gt; bynum n iggy  good traide magic even tho every1 though u got robbed
TheCronoMasterMind::Wow so many free throws! We've lost more games from the stripe this year than I care to count. Oh well, good game still, Bobcats do have some talent on their team, but its not always utilized, it seems.

Im a man Im Forty.::Nicholson needs more playing time. He is nasty.
jamel534::This team will go as Kemba goes, good win by the Cats.
Replacement Ref Apologist 2.1::This proves once and for all what a great team executive MJ is.... and what a great team the Boobcats are..... one in a row.
Area55andG2::I like how for one game the Magic were getting praised as a near future playoff team, and then they lose to the bobcats
MyVendetta::Good win and Bobcats got their 10th win.    Now get 20 wins.   This franchise will get better and hope in a few years they are playoff bound.  Best of luck and always nice to see you guys win.
Big M.A.C::Loads of people continue to troll Bobcats fans and that's fine by me. The way I see it, when we eventually become decent and people start to recognise that there is talent on this team, then i see us becoming the new bandwagon team. I'll be glad to have been a fan through thick and thin
Zimbowe::Bobcats are so beast!!!!!-mj
cjrwell::As a Magic fan I've got to say this is a great loss. When you're gunning for the lottery like ORL every loss is actually a win. And even more so when you're competing against the Bobcats for overall suckiness. Great loss. Only 4 games ahead of the trash Bobcats, keep losing bros!
TheCronoMasterMind::We aren't gunning for the lottery dude. The draft this year is weak.
CandySparker::Kemba &gt; Mamba
M80 The Wolf::DOUBLE DIGIT WINS!!!!
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::Was about to come back &amp; Trollllllllllllllll on Bobcats, but I digress. I have a lot of work to do. *pops Adderall*  *sighs* The life of a Doctorate student.   You kids have a good night.  I love you all.
Raviohli::Lame
AvengedByCats::Boy he struggles.
TCluvcarpanthers::K.
TCluvcarpanthers::K.
Loyal Sports Fan::Dammit, beat me to it, lol
Tnayshuss::Hell yes!  I didn't expect a win tonight!!!
TCluvcarpanthers::K, but you got one.
TCluvcarpanthers::In other important news, my fantasy team, the Charlotte Hornets, is 11-0.
big1366::Nobody cares!!!
7horns7eyes::K.
PEdRO2757::kongrats
dave19741997::Good game Cats fans.
TCluvcarpanthers::GG Magic fans.
TCluvcarpanthers::So who's liking every single comment?  My guess is JJ Reddick. (cause that's how useless he is)
TCluvcarpanthers::We have a winnable game tommorow at home against Sacramento. I wish we could get DMC from the Kings though.
PEdRO2757::yea he might be to much of a knucklehead tho
TCluvcarpanthers::K.
PEdRO2757::yea that would be very nice
PEdRO2757::i just realized that knuckle has a K in it lol
TCluvcarpanthers::But how beastly would a core of Kemba/MKG/Cousins/2013 lottery pick be?
Indychase22897::redneckrumbeld

Loyal Sports Fan::Oh, I thought it was K.
PEdRO2757::Kongradulations
Indychase22897::pork
PEdRO2757::i bet no one will find the hidden word
TCluvcarpanthers::Yea, he did mess up.
7horns7eyes::I know, that's why I said he messed up a bit; he got the alignment slightly off.
TCluvcarpanthers::The hidden word is poop.
7horns7eyes::You messed up a bit.
Loyal Sports Fan::K.
rjb9rc::The Magic beat the Pacers because they didn't shoot 30% from three.  But, that is the reason why the Magic lost to the Bobcats tonight.  Live and Die
PEdRO2757::like 60% of the comments have nothing to do with the game lol
OPENLYUGLY::Due to the unusual high volume, this thread will shut down in 60 seconds.
Loyal Sports Fan::Crap, that means no more "K"s

dave19741997::Magic will win 2/19
pantherfan2488::Since it's not being done on this site.  I feel this is the time to re-introduce (other NBA pages are doing it) the CATS- MAGIC RIVALRY.  We already have some premier rivalries, Heat-Lakers, Thunder-Spurs, Lakers-Celtics.  But what about the clashing of the two biggest titans in the South (you should feel honored I included Florida in the South)?.  I say we blow up this board every time the Magic Cats play.  Ill start:  Screw Orlando!
OPENLYUGLY::Orlando beat you to it! Sorry!
PEdRO2757::YEA!!!!!!
Tommy72931::Tough loss magic fan(s).  Doesn't get much worse than a home loss to Charlotte
OPENLYUGLY::Can say that again.
7horns7eyes::Q.
dave19741997::F.
PEdRO2757::K
TCluvcarpanthers::Don't k me.  K.   I do the "K's."  K.
OPENLYUGLY::That was on the road, but both are not acceptable.
Loyal Sports Fan::K.
TCluvcarpanthers::A home loss to the Wizards is worse.
TCluvcarpanthers::A home loss to the Wizards is worse.
Tommy72931::Lol... Doesn't get ANY worse than that.
TCluvcarpanthers::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9WZi5w1JTo
Loyal Sports Fan::Haha, "and the fan goes wild!"
TCluvcarpanthers::THAT WAS THE GREATEST VIDEO EVAA
PEdRO2757::cool story bro...that was an o-K video
TCluvcarpanthers::K.
OPENLYUGLY::Am I a bad Bucs fan sticking up for the Falcons? They've been getting disrespected from all angles.
TCluvcarpanthers::EVERYONE hates the FALCONS of ATLANTA because THEY are BAD
7horns7eyes::Yes.
PEdRO2757::yep the Falcons suck
OPENLYUGLY::My thinking is that I have plenty of time to get at them in the off season and beyond.
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::Do Bobcats have any rivals?
PEdRO2757::they beat the Lakers a lot
TCluvcarpanthers::The garbage Atlanta Hawks.
TCluvcarpanthers::K.
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::Oh.....   That rival = Two bums fighting over a sandwich.
7horns7eyes::Okay, who keeps liking everything?
7horns7eyes::I hope nobody thinks we're racist with all these "K"s in a row...
PEdRO2757::whats so racist about KKK? is obviously means  K-ool K-razy K-ows
PEdRO2757::the invisible hobo cows of the land of russia
TCluvcarpanthers::K.
PEdRO2757::ummm K?
7horns7eyes::K.
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::You should really work on your material......
PEdRO2757::K
Loyal Sports Fan::K.
TCluvcarpanthers::K.
OPENLYUGLY::C's LOSE, the night's not a WASTE afterall.
TCluvcarpanthers::Hey, I kinda like the C's.
TCluvcarpanthers::Idk, they're just a fun team to watch. I prefer them over the Heat or Knicks or Lakers.
OPENLYUGLY::Even when KG's hitting guys in the N-DS?
PEdRO2757::why can't we all be friends???? *braces self*
OPENLYUGLY::Apparently you can be even BETTER friends on "Franklin St.".
PEdRO2757::no i got the joke nupe
7horns7eyes::You're never gonna let him live this down, are you?
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::I think you missed the Joke Pedro.....
PEdRO2757::i don't wanna come to your house dude
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::Ha!
7horns7eyes::Screw being friends; that's boring. Get outta here with that hippie bs.
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::Yikes!
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::I am your friend.
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::The Booger guy knows about all the Gay bars on Franklin St......but he's not Gay.......Right.   Ha!
TCluvcarpanthers::K.
yanksonfire27::You Panthers fans must be mistaking your boy Cam for RG3..He is indeed the real deal. And he isn't a whiner like Mr. Newton.
PEdRO2757::what that guy with no knee?
pantherfan2488::that real deal of yours breaks like a match stick.  have fun with an always injured superstar
TCluvcarpanthers::He's not even a Redskins fan. He's just irrelevant.
TCluvcarpanthers::RG3 can't stay healthy.  Cam Newton is the real deal.
CoachHouser::Have the Magic sunk to a new low?  (And I'm not even an NBA fan).   I was so hoping the Magic would have a better record than the Lakers.
OPENLYUGLY::YES....... they have!
