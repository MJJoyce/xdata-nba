Tdogz97::This was embarrasing, and this play won't help us win the division. Still trying to erase this game from my mind
eaglessixersman::A bad loss,the Sixers definitely had to have this game, esp. with 10 of their final 15 games on the road including 5 straight to close out the season, tonites game against the Hawks is a must win, they are going to have to beat some teams that everyone thinks they can't to regain that division lead, which I think they can, 1 positive, as of rite now they hold the tie breaker over the Celtics in h2h wins

celticfan9262::THANK YOU WASHINGTON.
celticfan9262::welcome to number 7
allroy1313::I had a feeling they were going to blow this game; the Eagles have an inexplicable loss or two like this every year, and last night just felt like it would be one of those for some reason.
roundmoundgtown::That's because they both have the most overrated coaches in each respective league- NEWS FLASH- DOUGIE is just not that good, has never coached a team past a .600 win percentage

Foghorn HookemHorns::Hey Hollinger, pay attention.  Maybe the 76ers aren't ranked 4th anymore in your joke of a system?
Jimmy45795::Trending Now: Philly Loses by 21 points to a $@%! hole of a team the Washington Wizards.
NGplayinskillz::Philly is still a good team. People talked about the Indiana Pacers for almost losing to the Washington Wizards twice But the fact of the matter is the Washington Wizards have a GOOD starting lineup and they are NOT trying to tank (for some Reason).  John Wall is a Great PG, Jordan Crawford is an excellent scorer and Nene is Nene. If the Wizards make a few changes in the offseason I could see them making a push for the 8th seed in the playoffs next season.
CoffeeCup21::Sixers looking up at the Celtics..haha
0alexm::The 76ers need a healthy Spencer Hawes back.
roundmoundgtown::STOP IT with the Hawes talk my that cat is GARBAGE!!!! please wake up
0alexm::How did that happen?
J-SMOOVE2040::Philly is showing their true colors
griffin550::Philly is so overrated.
susanmdasilva@hotmail.com::vv
allroy1313::other than Hollinger, who is overrating the Sixers?  it's not like anyone else was giving them any respect when they were winning.
GeorgetownDCman::YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!! bout time the Wiz actually play a good game. Now lets get rid of Lewis and pick up Davis or Robinson in the draft
soccerdots28::washington teams getting it done tonighttt
pappydiving222::SHIIIIIIIITTTTTYYYY.  Putting my faith back in the Flyers.
roundmoundgtown::good move jump off this burning ship while u can
RollThunder35::WTF??????
RollThunder35::I dunno why I am talking, OKC lost to the Wiz.
travismiller411::Ive been following a betting system called sportsbettingstar for a couple of months. Since joining I have made over 3K a month on average by just following this system. Thought I would post this for anyone that is looking for a betting system that actually works
shivyjr::kentucky can beat the 76ers
Xnmt::No, Kentucky would get blown out, just like any other college team.
Elixxior::Dont yall agree
Elixxior::Ya know wht? the sixers are a wonderful team, they'e just been in a slump the past few motnhs. they''ll get out of it thou, they neeed to step up defensd andlimit oppo. to 40 ppg
ohedoh::John Hollinger says that Philadelphia is the fourth-best team in the NBA.  I say he should re-examine his methodology.  This team is going nowhere in the playoffs.
Darylalderman::Wow what a joke I hope we dont make the playoffs they need to get rid of some garbage
surfzone365::Philly fans should be use to losing
venator360::This is disgusting Philly lol.
surfzone365::Wow, and Philly is suppose to be EC contender?
JB_Mandingo_Smoove_Celtics::Tough loss for Philly... LMAO
z_man0789::that is just ridiculous
OFrog::Money line +3.70 and they win by 21. Replace has been Flip with Wittman, check. Ship off knucklehaed McGee for real player Nene, check. Scratch Blatche, DNP, check. Find new hungry players, check. Wash is not the same team now.
leonsearcy::check
Madhouse_United::Sixers are the 7th seed ATM. Not a good place to be at for them.
mj8648::sixers want the heat in the first round...
__666__::<b>The 76ers shouldn't be in the playoffs. An absolute disgrace. Doug Collins is a fraud. The entire team is full of frauds who can't make FTs for their damn life. How the fuck do you call that a playoff team? Looks like reality has finally caught up with this flukey team full of no-names. They don't even have ONE good player. Iggy isn't an all-star. I don't care what the hell you say, he's not an all-star. He can't make FTs and he's shooting less than 70% from the line. WTF!? Good for the Celtics, they deserve to be in 1st place. 76ers will be LUCKY at this point to even make the playoffs as the 7th or 8th seed...and I remember when people were saying how this team was the best team in the east, LOL. At least you still got the Fyers and Phillies. </b>
tmdm767::Eww.
AIadvocate::Iguodala sucks...Turner is regressing...Holiday is inconsistent, and we have no big men who can do anything, let alone a star, let alone a superstar... Collins needs to go and we need to trade Iguodala thanks
eaglessixersman::@AIadvocate: Nah Collins stays, I mean who do you get to replace him? I do agreed that Turner is slipping a lil, teams have started game planning for him and he has to step it up and adjust.  @Daryl: Turner's not a star by any stretch, but definitely not garbage, he will develope into a good player, and I would be cool with the sixers trading Iggy, but not for Ellis a undersized, gunner who brings little else to the table. The Sixers already have the poor mans version on the team, his names Lou Williams
Darylalderman::How can u regress when u always been trash and iggy should have been traded for monta a year ago
Alabamarolls4 14::Philly should not be in the playoffs after losing this game. Kentucky could beat the Wizards. At least they didn't pull a Magic feat and lose to the Bobcats.
marcus-s2981::Ummm i wouldnt go that far....the bobcats are pretty pathetic.
tmdm767::What's with all the complete morons saying kentucky would beat _____ in the NBA.  Kentucky would lose by 40 to the bobcats.
Rick-Da-Villain::Look up at the Celtics Sixers fans and say Cheese ..
mj8648::sixers suck... and i'm a sixers fan!!!
PensfanINorlando::LAWL SIXERS!
Heat Dynasty 2010-2020::Funny how sixer fans thought they were a good team when they were one of the top teams in the East.  They forgot they had to play good teans
I am a Thunder Bandwagon Fan::Philadelphia sports!!!!!
chazzzzz1965::Low point of the season Sixers.......very disappointing this is becoming a late season trend...
Gex.2::good job philadelphia  just kidding you're terrible
z_man0789::and 1
Celtics17Banners::Philly fans: say goodbye to first place
TheHedonismBot::Atlantic division = the Afc west of the NBA
Celtics17Banners::Your Logic = NL West
Bruce lees fist::Imagine what Kentucky would do to the 76ers. I shutter just thinking about it.
AIadvocate::And Calipari whop $@%!$@% is a cheatin dbag anyway
AIadvocate::historically
AIadvocate::Kentuckys not that great of a college team as is
AIadvocate::We'd beat Kentucky by 40 points...we beat the Celtics by 30+
Sportsman45029::$@%! you
