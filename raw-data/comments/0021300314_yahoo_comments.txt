Evan D::Lopez beasted the C's. Deron was huge as well. If D-will stays healthy, the Nets can go on a run and easily win the Atlantic. Don't forget Terry AND Kirilenko were out tonight, we need terry and D-will fully healthy if we're gonna make noise in the East. Kirilenko is just a bonus if we make the playoffs to help guard guys like Lebron and George. If the NETS play like the did tonight consistently, watch out NBA.
Wiseoldman::Wallace has too many turnovers and makes bad decisions when he gets the ball.  Good defensive player but he needs to be smart when he gets the turnover and not waste the play.
Dan::Two terrible teams here. The East consists of Indiana and Miami and 13 piles of hot garbage.  That is all.
Brian::Celtics have no legitimate center to guard Lopez.  But this is a young, hard working, and improving team.  They won't win a title this year, but they inspire hope for the future.  Nine draft picks in five years, baby!
David::The Celtics need to take advantage of their new youth. They need to run. They need to play aggressive defense. They need to hit the offensive boards. Otherwise the big name other guys will win.
David::Wallace needs to wake up. Two turnovers in two minutes??? The Celtics will never win that way; and they are already off to an extremely bad start. Closing to within 4-6 points or better by halftime will be the first chore. More effort and more concentration are needed. Leave Wallace on the bench if he is unwilling to concentrate.
Alfons O::Olynyk still with an ankle, Sullinger is still starting at center, and Brooklyn is soon to lose #16 even if it isn't tonight.
Daniel D::Who would have thought that this game would be easy for the Celtics at the beginning of the season? Well, it certainly does look like another winnable game for the C's.
zedaneski::Honestly, how bad do you have to suck to lose to the Nets?
PKM::Celtics will probably have too much juice for the Nets.
