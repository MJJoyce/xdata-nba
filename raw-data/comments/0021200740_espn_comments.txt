YogaBeer::LAST!
ggeewill::$@%!$@ Gibson was glued to the bench. I like the bench bunch.
agunes09::Listen Cav fans... the Magic were in the playoff hunt until the injury bug hit hard. As currently constructed the Magic are the better team. Injuries have derailed this team and they don't have a go to player yet.    Magic org &gt; Cav org    Simple as that.    The only hope you all have is if Lebron decides to play super hero and rescues your a s s e s by signing with the Cavs, which I find a joke that some of you don't want him back....    Yes you do.
Sleo810::Go cavs!! Trade our lottery pick &amp; gee for a proven PF that can get us 20 &amp; 10!! Call blazers (LAmarcus)
ggeewill::huh? We better keep TT
SteveUCF1::Why would the Blazers make that trade?
Banned in C-Town::.... It's nice to have a bench, Speights and Wellington both out scores the Magic bench... That's how you out the game away in the 4th

SteveUCF1::I think the Magic should play the young guys as much as possible so they can gain experience.  The season is over so we are playing for ping pong balls at this point.  Lets hope we win our fourth lottery this year.
justinmb1598::CAVALIERS PLAYOFFS! WINNING NBA FINALS THIS YEAR!
agunes09::The Magic will be back in the playoffs before the Cavs will... Take that to the bank.
ggeewill::Kidding right...Other than Micky Mouse why would you go to Orlando? You have some nice pieces, but this is the east and we all can say "before the injury bug"". Hell until Andy went down what team really wanted to play us?
agunes09::Listen Cav fans... the Magic were in the playoff hunt until the injury bug hit hard. As currently constructed the Magic are the better team. Injuries have derailed this team and they don't have a go to player yet.  Magic org &gt; Cav org  Simple as that.  The only hope you all have is if Lebron decides to play super hero and rescues your a s s e s by signing with the Cavs, which I find a joke that some of you don't want him back....  Yes you do.
SteveUCF1::The Magic have the advantage of being able to attract FAs.  In 2014 we will have a ton of cap space and a couple top picks under our belt.   I also think the Cavs are on the right path with the young players they have.   I don't think either team will make the playoffs next year.  Both have a shot in 2014/2015 IMO.
SteveUCF1::Greg Oden is done.   You have cap space, but do stars want to play in Cleveland?  James is from Ohio and he didn't even want to be there.
SteveUCF1::I agree that the Cavs are doing it the right way.  If you look a my previous posts i said they are on the right path.  I just didn't think next year would be a playoff year.  I could be wrong, but thats my opinion.  I think 2014/2015 they will for sure be a playoff team.
.BootyLoaf::lineup of 4 20-22 year olds that all will be great in this league, most cap space in the nba, the new addition of speights ellington and Livingston for the bench, 10 first round drat picks the next 3 years, addition of greg oden, and we already have the most important and hardest piece to get of the puzzle with the superstar. there is zero chance they are not a playoff team next year. with all the young guys ettin another year experience, all the trade chips with draft picks and expiring contracts, enough cap space to sign 2 max deals, ZERO chance of missing playoffs next year,
.BootyLoaf::and I don't have fan goggles on. im always very rrealistic when it comes to critiquing my teams. I have no issue saying my Indians are going nowhere any time soon. because they are not in the best situation. cavs are in a great situation. adam silver was even at the game yesterday and it cut to him talking about how the cavs have done the rebuild the right way and are on the championship path now
SteveUCF1::You're the one acting ingorant with insults.  I'm on this board because i'm a Magic fan.  I have been a Magic  fan since we started in 1989.   I cant admit that we suck right now, but i'm still a fan and watch the games.
.BootyLoaf::my problem is the ignorance of others. it gets old. and why in the world are  you on a cavs magic board anyway? to tell their fans that they are not good? and there are 32 games left, cavs need 14 to hit 30. id be willing to bet my LIFE on the cavs getting 30 wins this season
SteveUCF1::Grow up man.  I'm not sure what your problem is.
.BootyLoaf::lol can I please have your number so I can save it so I can rub it in your dumb @ss next season? please? I love idiots like you that are oblivious to real life and only look at standings and what not
SteveUCF1::Because i dont agree with you it means i  "don't know basketball"?   I think you have your fan goggles on.  Step away from the situation and take another look.  I'm not dogging on the Cavs.  I hope they do make the playoffs, i just don't see it next year.
SteveUCF1::The Cavs won't even win 30 games this year so it would be a huge step to win 45 next year.
.BootyLoaf::the cavs could not be in a better position to make the layoff leap next year.. I don't know what your mind is seeing
.BootyLoaf::then you don't know basketball plain and simple
SteveUCF1::Both teams are pretty bad right now so its hard to see either one being a playoff team next year.
.BootyLoaf::there is no way the cavs don't make the playoffs. I don't see any scenario except kyrie and andy getting hurt for the season that puts us out of the playoffs. anything less than 45 wins next year would be a disappointment
EnTiiGy::So you think the Magic are making the playoffs next year? Because the Cavs definitely are.
.BootyLoaf::elaborate please
TheCronoMasterMind::Magic seemed to have outplayed the Cavs, but when you get 28 more free throw attempts, something is up. Magic with 8 points in the paint less than the Cavs. Oh well I guess, glad to see the Magic are starting to make shots again.
ggeewill::Magic bigs KILLED us. That's the truth
.BootyLoaf::?? the magic did not outplay the cavs at all. the score shouldn't have even been so close.
Super Bowl NFL 11-11-93::They still lost because they suck so much.
scottsvb1::Zeller sucks.. 0-0 in 30 min. I watched the game and he was like a highschool kid in a Pro Ball game looking confused out there, especially on the defensive end. I know he's a rookie but is ANYONE teaching these guys how to play or is it all street ball? Gee still sucks and we need to get rid of him.   Outside of them 2.... a few bad defensive plays by our guards on Nelson being wide open a few times in the 4th.. they did fine.but vs Orlando isn't much news.
.BootyLoaf::gee is a terrific on defender on ball and off ball. knows his spots well and plays the passing lanes well. he just needs to polish his offensive game more. he just needs to realize when the rite time to do things is
Ecas1::Don't get me wrong, I am loving the direction that the Cavs are going, but seriously???? something needs to be done about our defense, it is honest to god atrocious, Imagine if we held teams to average scores each night and kept up our high temp offense.  I see big things coming if the cavs make a couple more right moves and maybe, if it's is right, pull on the trigger on one free agency splash
Brian Scalabrine is Undeniably the Greatest::Kryie Irving + the Thomas guy from Ohio State = recovery
EnTiiGy::Deshaun Thomas is the most below average basketball player I have ever seen.
.BootyLoaf::that doesn't even make sense...
TheBrownestBob::41 FTs!! Holy crap!!
HalfPear_HalfBatman::Attack mode
Neil826::ha the only highlight of the game they showed was 5 towel boys cleaning up a spilled drink.  talk about pathetic teams.
YogaBeer::troll of the night post?    Doesn't watch the games, then decides by a couple of seconds ESPN  chooses as highlights is this moron's view of the game and decides what kind of game it is.     Where do they find these trolls?
coltranesteelkirt::Cavs are a better team the Heat RIGHT NOW. You heard it here, first.
Sean31441::lolol had me laughing. gotta love the cavs though
Super Bowl NFL 11-11-93::Are you $@%!$@%!?
scottsvb1::your a loser
womblevader::Magic don't miss Howard at all.
89_tribe_time::If Lebron tries to come back, Gilbert should egg him on only to pull the contract at the last second.  F U Lebron.  It would be WAY more satisfying knocking Lebron and the Heat (or whoever he wants to collude with next to make winning easy) out of the playoffs than it would be to have him back.
scottsvb1::screw that.. I would take LBJ back in a second....Championship is more important than beating Miami in the playoffs and also having him on the team will give us the best chance still until this team can get a defense.
Ecas1::completely agree, I would rather see the cavs earn a championship than go ahead and buy one
DwightSchrute24::I'd Trade Zeller before I'd trade speights
Banned in C-Town::Um... Yeah, here is some more breaking news, grass is green
DwightSchrute24::$@%!$@%!$
Cbarber357::Cleveland should draft Doug McDermott
EnTiiGy::We just cut Luke Harangody aka Doug McDermott this season.
0tis Nixon::nothing in my lifetime will replace the magic of the 95 and 97 tribe
YogaBeer::Or the 2015 CAvalier NBA Trophy.  But seriously, mine was either the 1964 Browns or the 1948 Indians.    I know.   I'm old.
steve mctowelie::its good to dream
steve mctowelie::until your 2013 world series champion cleveland indians
thebuckeyeryguy::Or your 2014 Super Bowl Champion Browns... since we're dreaming.
steve mctowelie::it would take gigantic titanium balls to come back. id have to give him kudos if he did.but being in contention would heal alot of wounds
YogaBeer::He'd require more body guards then the president.
steve mctowelie::for a while. winning cures a lot of ills. this city is sick for a winner i believe he would be forgiven
YogaBeer::Cj Miles and Omri Casspi are FA.   Do we sign either/both/none?
TRHMC1::Casspi's done. Allegedly he got frustrated in a practice and Omri got fly with him...rumored something about he couldn't wait to leave. Scotts doghouse is like solitary in the penn.
YogaBeer::Wondered.   He never was anything more than a bench warmer, but when Luke Walton is far ... and I mean FAR better in every aspect of the game they you, you must be in some kind of doo doo.
Cbarber357::get rid of Omri
0tis Nixon::omri sucks
YogaBeer::Billups comes to mind.    Maybe Isaiah Thomas as well.
steve mctowelie::0tis Nixon - he can but as a PG name one other PG who led his team in scoring and shooting that won a title  magic johnson maybe
0tis Nixon::he can but as a PG name one other PG who led his team in scoring and shooting that won a title
.BootyLoaf::and kyrie can't be a go to guy on a playoff team LOL
.BootyLoaf::I think cj has another year and i'd keep him.
duy909::i would sign miles
0tis Nixon::ill suck lebrons dick if he comes back and were guaranteed a title
Ecas1::wouldn't take him back if he tried to pay us his salary, sorry we are going to actually try to earn our champtionship rather than go on vacation and buy it
TRHMC1::Wow.
CLEVELANDCBI::Way to take one for the team buddy.
0tis Nixon::all for one ONE FOR ALL
BuckeyeSwag101::To be honest. If Lebron comes back. I will stop watching the Cavs. I hate him before he left, and I still hate him. :)
Ecas1::rather sign him than get LeBron back, Cleveland is finally essnetially moved on, I'll pass on the drama and the publicity for the quiet, elegant, and just overall amazing to watch, humble Kyrie
Cbarber357::I hate sayin this as a Steelers fan, but if you want more money in Cleveland sign Alex Smith and I think the Browns can be competitive...
BuckeyeSwag101::True, but it will not work out IMO
DVR216::Sad Cleveland Fan I Just Want To See Us Holding A Trophy So Bad LBJ Or Not
DVR216::Plus the money that just having LeBron brings back to the city he is needed for this city
0tis Nixon::i wana draft someone who can score besides kyrie that wud be nice
0tis Nixon::i like speights
YogaBeer::Tristan Thompson and Dion Waiters
duy909::why can't he
BuckeyeSwag101::Dion has had some nice games. Ellington, Tristan, speights, and Miles can all contribute consistently
.BootyLoaf::??? have you not seen our scores lately?!?!?
.BootyLoaf::you have to be kidding me....
0tis Nixon::shutup booty loaf. i have, but as a playoff team kyrie cant be our go-to
BuckeyeSwag101::I could see the Cavs drafting Shannon Scott or some efficient point guard to back up Kyrie in a few years. Shannon Scott ha a 3-1 Steals to Turnover ratio, which is unheard of. He isn't a scorer, but in two years he'll be in the draft and could be a smart pick with his defensive skills. Great defender also.
EnTiiGy::Lol at the Buckeye homerism
duy909::if we going to keep varejao we have to draft a small forward with the first pick
duy909::i like scott passing and defense ability but if he can improve his offense he could be a good player
steve mctowelie::i dont follow college hoops till march that why i have no clue on who the cavs should draft
BuckeyeSwag101::Shannon Scott is a underrated backup Pg for Ohio State. Everyone probably thinks I'm crazy, but he could be an option in two years
YogaBeer::WoW  you really do think down the road.   :)
duy909::ohio states backup point guard atm
YogaBeer::Just being honest.   Who is this?
BuckeyeSwag101::The reason the Cavs have lost 34 games, is because they struggle to win the 4th Quarter. Nice to see them doing that.
TRHMC1::No, the reason they lost 34 games are because of 4 bench players who are all currently unemployed. Pargo, Sloan, Samuels and Luer were utterly useless...although Pargo had a nice run for a minute there. Having Livingston, Speights and Wellington, along with a very heady glue guy in Walton off the bench have been fantastic.   Tristans improvement has been huge also.
YogaBeer::Didn't I just say that but in a different way?
YogaBeer::It's that awkward time between the 3rd and 4th when the 2nd unit was in.    We simply got punked.    since Mo Speights and Duke Ellington and a heavy does of Livingston, that's changed.   gives our young, inexperienced 1st unit the legs to finish it out.
steve mctowelie::they have been doing a lot better coming out after halftime too
HunterF4444banned::You guys think Paul Millsap could play SF for the Cavs?
YogaBeer::Here's some of the "better" FA this summer who play SF;  Paul Pierce Andrei Kirilenko Shawn Marion Stephen Jackson Trevor Ariza Metta World Peace Hedo Turkoglu and many more...
YogaBeer::Well then count out Weeden.
11ClevelandSteamer11::I feel like Ariza could be the only one under 30 on that list
.BootyLoaf::yuck awful list
.BootyLoaf::I like jeff green from boston and want McAdoo in the draft
.BootyLoaf::no not at all
csmeech::It's safe to say that reddick is going to be traded.  No way he doesn't play with a sore shoulder.  That's just not JJ.  The Magic are trying to keep him healthy for the trade
Mittens___the cat::he going to my wolves to fix our last in the league 3pt shooting %
Cbarber357::How does everyobe else feel about these rumors that Lebron may be coming back?...
steve mctowelie::yoga i didnt take it wrong. i understood what you were saying its just 2 completely different things like apples to bricks
YogaBeer::Now you're talking LeBron James at clutch time.  :)
CLEVELANDCBI::I'd like us to get Oden cheap, save him for a game against the Heat, and have him take one of those rebuilt knees to Lebron's balls.
steve mctowelie::thats what walton is for. he would be an alltime cleveland favorite. maybe even have his jersey retired
steve mctowelie::id take iverson if it would help win a title.lbj did what he did im over it. i want a championship team
YogaBeer::I do apologize if you took it wrong.  I'm a Cleveland fan as well.    Maybe too proud, but no.   The only way I'd take him back is if he's the parking lot attendant.   The one under the Q.
steve mctowelie::dont get me wrong it would be more satisfying to knock out the heat with lbj still in miami then win a title, but im a cleveland fan ill tke what i can get
YogaBeer::I don't mean to say that your wife is in anyway that.   Just using that as an analogy.    What he did was WRONG.    You don't take someone back in after they've WRONGED you that hard, for that long.
.BootyLoaf::haha I agree this is basketball we're talkin here yoga but I still rather not have LeBron back
steve mctowelie::lebron isnt my wife
YogaBeer::So if your wife gives the mailman, fed ex guy and the lawnboy each BJs, then airs on the local news she's taking her "talents" to the shoe salesman, you'd take her back just for a good time?
.BootyLoaf::lol Iverson?? HELL. NO.
Cbarber357::I'd rather see Dwight Howard leave LA and come here
steve mctowelie::a tleast lbj knew what he wanted. dwight doesnt have a clue
Cbarber357::I didn't say I liked Dwight Howard... lol
.BootyLoaf::Dwight howard makes LeBron look like an angel
steve mctowelie::all is forgiven welcome back lets win some championships
YogaBeer::IMHO... no
CLEVELANDCBI::Haters and morons should realize the Cavs have a BRIGHT FUTURE. Talented young core. Tons of caproom. Tons of draft picks. I expect next year to make the playoffs, and a max contract to someone shortly after.  GO CAVS.
YogaBeer::How about Mo Speights?    We'll have to offer him something.    I'm hoping that goes well.   He says he loves playing in Cleveland.   We're the first team to give him this kind of opportunity with the consistent minutes.  It also goes to show you how badly we needed to upgrade that awful 2nd unit.   AND, could use a healthy big in the first.  I'm thinking Zeller is going to be fine as a C off the bench but we could use a banging C in this draft.
YogaBeer::Andy is one of those bigs that can bring it as a PF and a C, but is more suited for the PF position IMHO.   He simply doesn't fit on this team anymore.   And I also like the guy.   I still have the Andy wig from the first time it was offered.
CLEVELANDCBI::100% agreed on everything.  AV's awesome but a liability with his health.  If someone offers us something good for him I'd take it next year, and I love the guy.  It'd have to be a great offer though.
.BootyLoaf::anything less than 45 wins next year is a disappointment I think
CLEVELANDCBI::I'd SETTLE for 43, just to have a winning record again.  And I do think their youth will wear on "superior on paper" teams in a 7 game series.  Second round wouldn't shock me.  Chris Grant's starting to look like a genius.
YogaBeer::two teams I expect to see in the PO next season are the Cavs and Wiz.
Cbarber357::Okay, I'm going to start remembering the Cavs exist now. That trade made them good. I see good things next year if we keep the core together and draft smartly. Pick DJ Cooper second round!
AndrewNicholson44::I saw Cooper score 43 in 4ot once. He is a very good player who could make it in the NBA.
Cbarber357::Coop would be great running the point as a backup or stepping in for an injured player. Honestly, I think he'd fit in well as a backup for Russel Westbrook in OKC, or as a player in Toronto with Rudy Gay
YogaBeer::And the most difficult category on that list is assists.    Which is strange coming from one of the top Assists player in the country.
YogaBeer::The closest player to him was Gary Payton.   He wasn't a bad player.   ` sarcasm.
YogaBeer::Cooper is on pace to become the only player in the history of Division I college basketball to collect 2,000 points, 900 assists, 500 rebounds and 300 steals.
YogaBeer::I think can go in the mid to low 2nd round (only if the NBA scouting is on their toes), but might even be had as a non-drafted FA.
.BootyLoaf::but coop is a boss. he'll be a good nba player I think kinda like a Mario chalmers or earl Watson maybe
YogaBeer::this is a fairly recent thing.     The sport is well over 100 years old.    Before the mid to late 1990s most every player played for 4 years.
Cbarber357::your point is valid, but it's still impressive either way. he missed some time his sophomore year from an injury I think too?...
.BootyLoaf::like I said, to be fair most top level players leave after 1 or 2 years.. and until 2006 players didn't even have to go to college
YogaBeer::He's getting close to that stat line that no NCAA player as EVER achieved and on one knows who he is except us lowly Ohio fans and maybe the Michigan team he punked last March.
Cbarber357::true, not anymore, but they used to and there have been plenty of great 4 year starters at other mid-majors
.BootyLoaf::to be fair no great player stays 4 years
.BootyLoaf::steeler fan?? yuck, no thanks we don't want you and especially if you were just fair weathered anyway
Cbarber357::I don't bash on the Browns, I like to see a good game. I was at the New Years Day game last year
Cbarber357::like I said, we're closest to pittsburgh and my grandpa was from there
.BootyLoaf::tell your dad I say shame on him
.BootyLoaf::you're from ohio?!? that's even worse. nothing is worse than an ohio steeler fan
Cbarber357::get over it, I'm from ohio, but closer to Pittsburgh than Cincy or Cleveland. Came home from the hospital in a steelers onesy when I was born. lol. I didn't ever know any other way, but I grew up a Cavs fan too
.BootyLoaf::the thought of sharing a team with a steeler fan kinda upsets my stomach
Cbarber357::I support the Cavs all the time, I'm just a really busy college student who has to work and doesn't enjoy watching the Cavs get beat up with the little free time he has, especially when I have a good college team to watch
Cbarber357::oh, and get Greg Oden
YogaBeer::That's what I keep telling em Cbarber.  go Cavaliers!    go Bobcats!
Cbarber357::right on
Yata-garasu::Awesome win today!  Another huge day from the bench!  They are so efficient on offense and defense.  I think Luke Walton is really helping them.  Lol.  He makes the smart pass/play and has really contributed.  LOL.  Good game to the Orlando fans!  And hopefully I will see you guys tomorrow against the Nuggets!  GO CAVS!!!
nargash::Good night. Get the Cavs bear back..!!
.BootyLoaf::no, I like the new him. he is sprouting without that bear.
nargash::LOL I forgot. Just get that bear back..!!
.BootyLoaf::Indians bear loser!
Bill O O::Otis, time to go to bed, the old ladies upstairs.   You can reminisce more  tomorrow.
.BootyLoaf::bedtime is 11:30 on fridays
HunterF4444banned::LOL at this guy
0tis Nixon::i also hear that at Nicks Sports bar or whatever by e.4th and the jake, Delonte used to go there and he brought a skegway in there and they let him in with it cuz he tipped well. anyways he wud go in the basement where theyd have provate or just select ppl go and hed ride around on his skegway smoking a blunt and get high with the owner and managers
Bill O O::That story I believe
.BootyLoaf::not feeling that one
0tis Nixon::supposedly varejao has a monster dong and when he goes out he gets whatever woman is in the bar
Bill O O::Otis, your obsessed with dongs
.BootyLoaf::would not doubt it
YogaBeer::v   and this guy wonders how we know he's not a troll   v
0tis Nixon::Andy also brought some girl from mayfield who i have mutual firends with to a hotel , ptob the rennaisance and they banged for 3 days straight
.BootyLoaf::lol keep em comin
Bill O O::Otis, Otis, Otis,  I thought you cleaned up your act
HunterF4444banned::cool...?
zachzach1010::Cavs seems to be playing good ball as of late. The Grizzlies trade made them a better team. Like to see them continue to improve.
YogaBeer::I'm starting to feel badly for the Grizz.   They had a serious opportunity to contend... not just in the PO, but to contend THIS season.    That trade put a damper on that.
.BootyLoaf::greg oden could be offered deal this month --------&gt;  nice
YogaBeer::Hoping it becomes the next Big Z story.    Remember everyone thought the big fella was done after all those foot surgeries?  I say hang Big Z's jersey at the pre-game ceremony at the next home game with the Heat.
0tis Nixon::Varejao and Pavlovic were on W6th and Andy took a girl into the bathroom stall (probly Balrey or Blind Pig) and whipped out his wang while Sasha guarded the door n they fu.cked. TRUE STORY
Bill O O::Did you get some bad crack?
YogaBeer::I also believe Louis Tiant also holds the record for most innings pitched w/o allowing a stolen base.   Something in the upper 260/270 innings.
trout391::i have his autograph
steve mctowelie::the record for stolen bases in a game is 7   cole stole 5 twice
Yata-garasu::Wow....  That is like a years worth of innings for an elite pitcher....  On another note...  Why is Jimenez so bad at holding runners??? Lol.
Yata-garasu::LOL.
YogaBeer::No video of Louis in his home town?
YogaBeer::I'm also thinking that Manny Ramirez has the record for stealing the same base twice in the same inning.   (he stole the base.   Thought it was a foul ball.    Stunned, the Defense watched him walk back to 1b.)
YogaBeer::... and then on the next pitch steals 2nd base once again.  the following pitch, he was caught off the bag at 2nd.  Manny being Manny.
Bill O O::He had a great windup
steve mctowelie::thats impressive
nargash::Good to see Andy on the bench again..!!
Beat Your Bookie::Hopefully you followed @BeatYourBookie1 on twitter!!!!!! Your gambling just got 100000X better!!!!
bjoellevine::Yeah, I believe you're a real person.  Go away.
0tis Nixon::SPAM
0tis Nixon::no.
Beat Your Bookie::Not spam, I am a real person. 4-1 record tonight. Follow!
bjoellevine::28 more FT attempts...sounds like classic NBA officiating in Cleveland..
steve mctowelie::yes because a 16-34 team is always getting calls from the refs
bjoellevine::You'll note the use of the word "classic".
Super Bowl NFL 11-11-93::No.  The Magic is garbage.
.BootyLoaf::ignant!!
browzen63::Lakers pull away in the 4th, top bobcats........this is headline news.....lol
YogaBeer::Too much Antwan Jamison and Kobe in the 4q
steve mctowelie::im rooting for la
Bill O O::The real Otis Nixon was the best drag bunter of his day!
Bill O O::Ask Otis, he's here
YogaBeer::never mind I just googled.    If you count baseball just after the Civil War, there were a couple with 7.  But in the modern era there are a handful with Otis doing it first....  with the tribe.
YogaBeer::Didn't he break the record for most steals in a game with like 6 or something?
YogaBeer::I think Alex stole 3 in one inning.    Dang it.   Now I have to do more google.
steve mctowelie::wasnt that alex cole?
Bill O O::Are you the real Otis Nixon?
Bill O O::It is you!
0tis Nixon::yes. im black and steal bases and do crack...occasionaly.
0tis Nixon::Byron is a good coach for developing talent but not winning
nargash::Scott had the best winning % before he was Cavs coach. After 3 seasons, it changed..!!
0tis Nixon::nets. 1 good yr
YogaBeer::However, as Long as I'm taking the bait...   Once he's all done developing, we'll bring back Phil Jackson.
YogaBeer::The reason he has a losing record is he's been the coach of the Cavs for the past 3 years.
.BootyLoaf::you obviously didn't know the situation then so I suggest you shut up
0tis Nixon::hes fallen out with cp3 tho thats not a good sign
.BootyLoaf::he has always started on losing teams and very quickly brought them to the top of the league
0tis Nixon::hornets. 1 good yr
.BootyLoaf::ignant
Bill O O::Tomorrow night is true test of Cavs resurgence
YogaBeer::Yeah buddy!     Looking forward to it.     Cavaliers have not had the best of luck in b2b until the Grizz trade.    So it'll be interesting to see what (if he has to) B Scott says/does to get the players up for the game.    Usually these are the type of games young teams mess up.
