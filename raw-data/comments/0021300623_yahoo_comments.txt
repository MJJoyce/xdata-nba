Rob::Hawks are really playing together, despite injuries.  Give Coach Bud a couple more quality players, and this team will be formidable.  They play hard, smart, and together- the opposite of recent Hawk teams.
Richard L::Keep it up, Oladipo. Great game tonight. Magic is a few players away from seriously competitive while you build up your confidence and experience.
zack::Yeah, I wouldn't have expected Davis to be taking a last second shot. Although it still is a team sport.
Isaac M::*sigh*  Lottery pick, Magic. Just... just get that good lottery pick.
Brian::What did you do magic you should of kept Howard they been almost the worst team in the past 2 years
