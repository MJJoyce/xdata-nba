Kenneth::Been to the last 3 Pelican games as I am addicted to watching "the Brow" play b-ball. AD is as smooth as silk and his feet are quicker than the eye. You hardly see him leave the floor like a magician he is in the air above the rim. And to think he is only 20 years old and will fill out his frame with some more bulk. Definitly another SUPERSTAR in the making!!!
Darth Apollyon::People criticize the Spurs for losing against elite teams, but what use is playing your heart out against an elite team in a regular season game if you are going to be losing games like this.
/?/::What is going on blazers, only 3 players in double digits.  You had better get it together before tomorrow night or OKC will walk all over you.
schmoe::Why in the heck are Leonard and Wright playing ahead of Robinson. I know he doesn't have a jumper, but at least he makes good plays off misses and grabs rebounds. Could be a coincidence, but they haven't looked as good since he left the rotation.
Tony Anthony::Wow. Holiday going off with 16 in the 4th!
Curtis::The Blazers are great, however the road will slow them down, Good luck Blazers and rip city all the way.
Dixon Cider::Davis  LA. They score close to the same but davis is the more complete player and better defender
Tex Rubinstein::Blazers need to forget about the loss to the Heat and come prepared to play hard in this game and get back on the winning track. Unfortunately the Pelican lost today, which makes them that much more dangerous in this game.
mR. bAt::Mo williams sucks. he is not the answer for a 6th man on this team
Tony::Blazer fans, remember it's an 82 game season. Every team goes through ebbs and flows, and any team can win or lose on a given night. The last two games they got beat by last second shots, it could have easily gone the other way. The season is a marathon, not a sprint. Wait till McCollum plays, he will be way more consistent than Mo is, once he gets his N.B.A. legs under him.
