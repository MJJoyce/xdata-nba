I was looking for a handicapper one night and just google searched for  Sports Betting Systems, it was there on the first page. Didnt seem legit at first but ended up being awesome.
dannygopher1234::does anybody have pictures of todays game I want to see the jerseys
relentlessind127::The fact that people think its using excuses to say injuries have hurt us this year? We are missing our best player our second best player is coming back from an ACL injury. Our 3rd best player Pek is out...guy we paid 10 mill to in the offseason to fill our SG hole B-Roy. Guy we traded a few people to get Budinger is out.  guy we signed over seas Shved is out?? like uhh are you stupid not to mention Malcolm Lee.
Brickyyy Rubio::bricky rubio for the 3!!!!!!!!!    BRICKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::I just wanted to know if the same guys who beat Houston were worth a crud in this game..well, were they??
Rockets_waiting_for_next_level::Chris Johns played 10 minutes..this is a D leaguer.. Gelabele played 16 minutes..  what kind of playing time inconsistency is this??

LivingTheHighLife1985::Ive been betting with a system named SportsBettingStar for only 60 days now and have profited about 3K each month just by following its tips.
bonedawgred::Why in the hell hasn't Pargo been here since the beginning of the year ???
Lemuel7043::cause he's old. Hawks are rebuilding so we don't need old players
Lemuel7043::anyone knows why Morrow and Deshawn didn't play?
Alex4ATL::morrows back and deshawn has old man knees.
atlphillip::Injured
bonedawgred::Because they are not really a fit for the Hawks
kalekg187::Injuries, injuries, injuries - Minnesota fans are absolutely awful at these excuses for EVERY sport.
MNsportsfan77::We're pulling people off the street to fill the roster.  These last two additions are playing well atm.  Not an excuse when they don't even have enough players for 5 on 5 drills in practice. They still need to be playing better than they have in the past 2 weeks though.
2LikeABoss6::How can a Team win w/o healthy players. Poor wolves.
Melosh1977::By scoring more points than the other team. The wolves can't do this with healthy players.
csallstar11::Which fan base finds more excuses for losing Lakers or Twolves?
Brandon.Bachman::It sucks because of all the injuries... Well there's always next year...
LivingTheHighLife1985::Ive been betting with a system named SportsBettingStar for only 2 months, and have profited about 3K each month just following its tips.

Harrison Smith.::My god were trash...
bstanto_08::Rubio is trash...time to cut his @SS
RavensMNWild::http://www.draftday.com/go/skillslayer  Come play me.. Winner gets 5 dollars.. No credit card or anything needed.. Pretty fun.
Minnysota Vikings::Was the Wolves defense that bad or were the Hawks just on fire? 57.7% shooting with 32 assists?
Tyler BarnesMNSports::I didn't watch the game, I was at a movie, but looks like another horrible collapse... Wow
Demonjoe93::When the Hell did Pargo start playing for us again?
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::Today------10 day contract. He fits so well with what we do it's stupid.

RavensMNWild::Barea played like $@%!.. Get the $@%! out of here...
eototalt::Lynx &gt; Wolves
MinniWolves90::We need to teach the guys shot selection, somehow.
CommitmentToExcellence1968::Ive been following a bet system called SportsBettingStar a few months back.  Since I started playing this system, Ive doubled my money in just 2 months.  You will be able to find this system on the first page of Google when looking up Sports Betting Systems.
rleroy1967::At least Wild off to a great start along with Gopher Hockey.  Also, Gopher Basketball is ranked 12 still.  To bad for the Wolves that people are going to lose interest again.
eototalt::Women's hockey team is on a 33 game win streak. lol
RavensMNWild::It's hard to keep interest when the whole year you are watching back ups...
rleroy1967::Ski-U-Mah!  I didn't mention them because that is common knowledge!
Will Conroy.::i will enjoy watching the First Half of games and then taking a long nap during the 2nd.
Pusha Tonn::lol, you're sooo right Will
Pusha Tonn::well im out guys, gg hawks fans. another day another sh.itty 2nd half :(
MinniWolves90::See you next time.
eototalt::adios!  Start watching some Wild games. Hockey &gt; All. lol
eototalt::lol
Pusha Tonn::well im busy right now but I think i'll try it. looks funny
Human Fire Hydrant::I wish reefdawg had leukemia.
eototalt::Looks good on u tho - Support the AHL and ECHL....  I am sorry I should have been more specific. PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY.
eototalt::Injuries can kill a team. Just look at the Blazers and Wolves. It's hard to win when many of your better players keep getting hurt. Like seriously this is getting ridiculous. It's as if someone dug up a Native American burial mound or something.  And no it is not the curse of Brandon Roy. We were riddled with injuries last season before he got here.
Will Conroy.::Must be Adelman bring back the Coach of the Year Rambis.
Dame Lillard::And we don't have a bench, either.
MinniWolves90::Curse of KG - We will not make the playoffs until he retires. We were on the way before injuries hit us last season and this season.  My theory, anyway
Dame Lillard::We've done well with injuries.  We had 50+ wins with a ton of injuries. Last year was the exception for us.
eototalt::I am talking about the Oden Roy years.
MinniWolves90::What do you guys think the big problem is in the second half, bad coaching adjustments? Or guys getting tired?
Looks good on u tho::No "go to" guy....  Rely on JJ and Luke....  Ouch
MinniWolves90::All they kept doing was dribbling in circles then throw up off-balance shot.
eototalt::All of the above.
Pusha Tonn::agreed
Pusha Tonn::if only first halves counted.... 3rd seed baby!! lmao
Dame Lillard::Quit taking all of our reject players... We got rid of them for a reason.
Pusha Tonn::cunningham played good dame
Dame Lillard::No B-Roy or CJ (CJ was absent with his 5 fouls).
Reefdawg7::hahaha t-wolves suck
Human Fire Hydrant::I really hope you end up with cancer someday. Kings are headed to Seattle, not the wolves.
Reefdawg7::Too far buddy bringing up kids getting shot.  In all seriousness though the T-wolves are really bad.  Maybe if its not too late you can convince Seattle to take the T-wolves.
Human Fire Hydrant::Too bad you didn't get shot in connecticut instead of those children.
Reefdawg7::Someone should take the T-wolves season out back and give them a gunshot wound.  End the misery.
Human Fire Hydrant::I hope you die of a gunshot wound someday.
Reefdawg7::T-wolves are gonna be so good this year blah blah blah....oh wait they blow again
Human Fire Hydrant::get cancer already.
Nowitzki.::Chris Johnson back to scrub mode
SlappaDaBaseMon::well... the Wild are 2-0
Enri006::WOW!!!!! Terry Porter is soooooo bad.  Why the $@% was Rubio playing in the 4th quarter.  You got Barea who is having a good game and is the teams best fourth quarter scorer and instead you go with Rubio that really is unbelievable.  Rick Adelman must return quick or Terry Porter will get fire for sure.
Enri006::jajajajaj you are crazy 14 points 7 assists 2-5 from 3pts.  What ever.
Will Conroy.::Barea was chucking it
MinniWolves90::2 of next 3 games are very winnable games.
Looks good on u tho::No doubt we will win....  the first halves, anyway
Pusha Tonn::f johnson commits 5 fouls in 10 mins and we play gelabale less than 20 mins, NO
MinniWolves90::I know it. Johnson needs to calm down and Gelabale needs more minutes.
GaspoMinnyFan981::Bobcats and wizards right?
MinniWolves90::Yeah both on the road though.  Home vs. Brooklyn first.
Dame Lillard::Why did Terry Porter take this job???  His family still lives in Beaverton, OR...
Rex Ryans Tattoo Artist::Because no other organization would be dumb enough to hire him.
Nowitzki.::haha
eototalt::At least the NHL is back. :)
Looks good on u tho::I saw that the sheep were led to slaughter in near record droves Saturday.....all but 3 sell outs...  Bettman thanks you.  BAAAAAAA
Looks good on u tho::Support the AHL and ECHL....
eototalt::Real hockey fans just want to watch hockey. I am sorry you aren't a real hockey fan.
Will Conroy.::I wished I liked hockey more but Go Wild!!!!
eototalt::Were like the heat of the NHL! lol  ok, not quite on that level, but similar.
Pusha Tonn::why gelabale just 16 mins? only 3 shots? he was making them. give him minutes and give him the ball. terry porter you're fired!
Will Conroy.::Get Luke outta here
