luvnbayes::The Memphis announcer last night was saying that Gasol is the best defensive center in the league, and I respect that.  But I think Tim Duncan is still the best help defender in the league.  He is always at the right spot at the right time.  I have always thought Duncan was overrated offensively but underrated on the defensive end.  And he's still the most valuable Spur.  Take him out and it becomes a layup fest for the other team.
doof54::Not sure why anyone would spew a bunch of venom in the direction of the Timberwolves. Tough season with all the injuries. Should be different when all your players are healthy. Good luck.
Grindhouse2413::Sorry MN fans. I hope the best for you guys next year. Good crowd last night. Esp for a Monday night game. Season is winding down and these playoff spots are neck and neck. Every win matters. Good win Grizzlies.
gooseydan::While I'm on a roll viqueens, goofers, twinkies, wild, wolvies are the laughing stock of sports. At least you're consistant....being in the bowels of what it's like to be crappy sports in MN.
Get your foot off the boat::Vikings made the playoffs and have the reigning MVP; Golphers are in the NCAA tourney; Twins have a couple WS championships; Wild are in first place in the division; and the TWolves are devastated by injuries.....  Oh, and while I'm on a roll.....bite me.
gooseydan::Woof woof you t-wolvers. Bet you don't sleep well at night being a fan. If you sleep well then you and the t-wolvers deserve each other. An absolute disgrace to the NBA and the game of basketball around the world.
1grizzfan4life::Great win Grizz! I can't be on the boards all the time cuz I'm not always home. But I'm glad my Grizz got the W! We needed this one in the worst way. I was at the casinos all weekend and couldn't be on here to converse with the Nug and Jazz fans. Glad we got this W and I will see my fellow Grizz fans at the Forum Wednesday! Already got my tickets!
batennisstud::@woyplate
YogaBeer::Good to see Zach Randolph back on the floor.
ksjameson::Wolves nearly pulled this one out ...
R Barron::Disaster of a season for the t wolves. They could make the playoffs next season.
gooseydan::Tongue in cheek perhaps about possibly making playoffs next season? Really? They're always a disaster. Until next season.......t-(terrible) wolves need to hybernate forever.
doggbrown1::1-6 rubio lmao
tmoneyinmphs::I tried to tell y'all that rubio don't know about the grit and grind.  He got really frustrated tonight.
ksjameson::Never mind that he'd averaged 18 PPG over his past four games.
rhuff1118::Miami is the big story but here comes quiet Memphis, on a roll of their own.
Soul_Sonic_Force_2::Go Memphis!!!!
MrInvictus::Chicago made a great comeback, they're down by 1 in OT to Denver... Let's go BULLS!!!
swifferhouse::Chicago up by 1pt now
MrInvictus::Grizz by 15, just as I predicted.  Wed against Thunder, I'll be at the GrindHouse to witness Grizz by 7
rleroy1967::Hello...hello....hello....hello...echo....echo....echo.....................
htownse1::All We Do is WIN WIN WIN no matter what!!!
its1929again::10th win in a row over lowly Timberwolves
rleroy1967::Sorry MrInvictus....Tubby hasn't done crap for Gophers.  He can't even get Minnesota's top talent to play for him over the last 6 years.  Players have left the program for other schools too.  He is disinterested and full of excuses.  Horrible.  What a bad decision he was.
jrussek::Lol I love all the gopher fans who hate Tubby.  Where were they before he got there?  Same as football, everyone wanted Mason's head.  They got their wish in Brewster soon enough and we all know how that turned out.
MrInvictus::Well, I'm an outsider looking in.  They played in the toughest conf in YEARS this season and still managed to get an at-large bid.  Even cracked the top ten at one point.  When was the last time they've done that?
rleroy1967::Top ten then tanked.  Look at their big 10 record and who they lost to.  Horrible.
motigers06::minn college team better then these losers
ksjameson::Um, no.
MrInvictus::That's a stretch... I remember when the Grizz were struggling about 5 yrs ago and ppl were saying that about the CDR,Rose,Dorsey Tigers team, smh
rleroy1967::Jeff Green has 41 for Celtics to start the 4th Quarter!  Woot...Woot!
jarrollin::that Oladipo would look good in a twolves jersey
wunderrr::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ63CGBuzwE  i need to keep posting this haha
Minnysota Vikings::Saw Indiana play a couple nights ago. He didn't score much but I was still really impressed with the decisions he made on the court. He's a winner.
rleroy1967::The Miami vs Boston board is crazy....way over 5000 comments....probably 10000 by now.  Really slow too.  Great game too.  On ESPN.
wunderrr::losing by 15 is pretty alright, nice 1st Q: 3 by Jello,putback slam by Dante, shotblock by Steamer, 3 by Barea..what a sequence :)  good game Grizz fans, countin on you in the playoffs.
MrInvictus::Look at the bright side MN fans, yours Gophers will do MUCH better in the NCAA Tourney that I expect the lackluster Tigers to do, smh
MrInvictus::Why?  He's got better talent in there than yall have had in 15 yrs
rleroy1967::I want to do good enough to get our coach Tubby fired....lol
Everyday im Shufflin 290::GG Wolves Fan
Dominic10002::Good job Grizz!!!
Minnysota Vikings::Jim Peterson is right. Shved needs to have a great offseason. Working on his shot and building some muscle is vital. It'll be interesting to see what his body looks like next season (I know, that sounds really gay)
wunderrr::somehow i always like your comments. keep it up haha
rleroy1967::You sound kinda hot!!!!!!!!!!!
Minnysota Vikings::it's my blue eyes
rleroy1967::Wow.  Is 312 comments right?  We really gave up on Wolves but how can you blame us?
LuLu_Moot157548::Have you drafted yet:  http://tinyurl.com/nba-free-challenge5
tribeguy216::guess they got the 2 h over too sweet
MrInvictus::Watching MN is like watching an all-international team, lol.  How many languages are ppl cursing in, in that locker room
TrueBlue2215::lol
wunderrr::i guess they are learning a lot of cursing this season haha
xbonezzo::If only i can watch 1 entire season where no players are injured
xbonezzo::Lol i know
TheJTram::Good man. Unfortunately, that's just a dream unless you play 2k13.
clevelandbuffalo::Why are the Memphis starters playing against the wolves bench right now?
MrInvictus::Coach Hollins is ALWAYS monitoring chemistry and working on rhythm, even in blowouts
xbonezzo::Same thing happend when we played nets
GoTigers2015::Is Barea more famous for flopping or getting clotheslined by Bynum?
TheJTram::So yeah...how's Prince doing with yall today
GoTigers2015::12 rebounds, double-double
wunderrr::saw that pass by Shved to the legs of Stiemsma? thats why he cant be th PG
TheJTram::So um hey. We got blown out...again lol so what's up

GoTigers2015::We're resting John Leur for the playoffs, don't put him in yet
razorback117::we're bout there with a 17 point lead
razorback117::put him in please... hollins is the stupidest best coach ever
MrInvictus::Stupid coach?  Really?  I guess that's why he's been coach of the month 3 times this year?
icepik1234::let it get to 3 minute mark at least then clear the bench
icepik1234::with a 14 point lead? nahhhh
GoTigers2015::Jellyball is a future STAR
jakeOjed1990::Kevin Love is the man
Sir Mittens the ninth::I think the Wolves should try to trade Rubio, he's weak and always injured. It would be best for the organization to let Shved become our starting PG.
Minnysota Vikings::That would be a terrible decision. You don't sell low on a player with the potential Rubio has. The problem right now is Rubio is a distributor on a team with no shooters. He'll dominate once the Wolves get proper surroundings for him.
wunderrr::no Ricky will work on his shot, then he is an excellent PG. great court vision, great passing and some steals oh and he can drive it too
Sir Mittens the ninth::Lets hope and see next year if he and the team advance to the next step.
thomasf9497::uh no.
GoTigers2015::gotigersmemphis87 - GoTigers2015 - lol lakers  I knew you were a Faker fan  You're an idiot, was in reference to Thomas. Not too surprising, critical thinking isn't your thing
gotigersmemphis87::GoTigers2015 - lol lakers  I knew you were a Faker fan
GoTigers2015::lol lakers
thomasf9497::Is Kevin love actually sitting on the bench??
icepik1234::Are we gunna get a Leuer sighting tonight?
GoTigers2015::No, if Leur gets in, we automatically go up 50
1Elijah19981::probably
RickyWolfioGOAT::what's the point of watching fellow wolves fans!
wunderrr::watching if Shved made some progress
Minnysota Vikings::lol the Grizzlies are up by 28 and the fans loudly boo an out of bounds call?
GoTigers2015::Refs got to get it closer
razorback117::pittman must be more worthless than thabeat was
razorback117::i know pittman sucks but dang it. zac or marc getting hurt in useless minutes sucks worse!!!
razorback117::it didn't take too long for him to warm up to daye
icepik1234::because daye can shoot
razorback117::there will come a time in the playoffs like last year when u have to play him like u did hamed haddadi last year, and youll wish you gave him a few minutes earlier in the year to atleast know what he can do.
razorback117::i hear ya, but why can't pittman give gasol a rest in garbage time. if he jams a finger in the 4th i'm getting pi""""
icepik1234::Hollins takes a while to warm up to players before he will let them play. Pittman just joined the team. I would expect to see us go small instead of playing him in garbage time. also he kind of sucks.
GoTigers2015::Go small, rather keep Gasol in or sub in Pittman
GoTigers2015::Pittman at least wasn't a wasted #2 pick overall
56tricolor14::You guys see Wolves harlem shake?
MrInvictus::Only lames still make/watch Harlem Shake videos.  It's dumb, ppl aren't even doing the Harlem Shake???
56tricolor14::So I'm guessing no
