clyde::I think all of the big draft busts have been centers which can at least be understood a little. Bennett had tweener written all over him. If he managed to be all his size permits, he might be a decent 15-10 guy with limited D. There was no potential like in Olidipo who was the only 'can't miss' I knew of.
Pops::the triple double is the most contrived stupidest statistic in all of sports  2 players   lets say one has  12 pts, 10 rebs. and 10 assists   another guy gets   35 pts   15 reb. and 8 assists---the 1st guy gets all the attention because he had a triple double   same in baseball  the cycle--its so stupid      what is the better game   a homer, a triple , a double, and a single    or 2 homers, a double and a single------obviously the latter is the best game,  but who will get the headlines  thing is    99 percent of fans   go along with it
Commenter::so maybe Afflalo can play basketball...

Shawn Matthews::Doron Lamb DNP - Coach's Decision      play him
donald::Turner can lead the Sixers to the playoffs if they get a little more depth.  They've only got 6 dudes who can play, the others are just out for a run.
