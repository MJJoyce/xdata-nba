luvnbayes::I believe Manu has amazingly only missed 6 playoff games his entire career.  The Spurs record in those six games?  1-5.  You can talk all you want about Manu's relatively poor play this year, and I would agree.  But that we don't need him come playoff time?  Not a chance.
Alex27667::manu is the spurs x factor. theres a reason the spurs lost to the grizz when manu injuired his shooting hand in 2011. had manu not injuired that arm, who knows what 2011 couldve been like with a healthy manu
June 24th Is STILL Kobe Bryant Day::Very true.  Manu is a big game performer.  Simple as that.
john3_08::Great game, however Duncan at the rim and Kawhi on the wing might have altered Conley's game winning shot. Spurs at full strength would sweep the Griz come playoff time.
CBReal02::We will see about that sweep now.
faargsob::What's wrong man, did your mom tell you to make your own grilled cheese?
Parks O::Do you not remember what happened two years ago? Even poppovich said out of ten games these teams would split 5-5
MemphisSwag::Says the butt hurt fan...
luvnbayes::For all you Spur fans who think Manu is done, the last two games gives you a glimpse to a post-Ginobili world.  It's not only that he does all the little things, or that he's the only Spur who makes his teammates better, or even that when he's the closer he usually makes the right basketball play.  It's that he gives the entire team confidence, even Parker.  TP plays much better when Manu is on the floor.  There's a reason why Manu has the best career winning pct. of any active player.
TWex2120::Manu has the best because of one person. Tim Duncan. Simple as that. You think a world without manu is scary? Just wait till Tim hangs it up
TWex2120::Right but that doesnt change the fact that Tim is the most important when it comes to our playoff run. Manus percentage is higher because when he plays Tim plays. Tims is just barely lower because Tim is playing when Manu is hurt. Which happens to be quite often.
luvnbayes::I agree with that but its not Tim with the best pct., it's Manu.
Mastadon-person::the way manu has been playing with all his turnovers and low shooting percentage- i doubt he would've put us over the top in either game... hopefully he can get healthy and contribute in the playoffs
Griss13ears::Everybody was saying Memphis lost there go-to guy for crunch time shots when they traded Rudy. Now we've got Conley hitting game winners, Bayless hitting clutch threes to send games to overtime, and Marc hitting game winners. Nobody is talking about Rudy Gay anymore. Memphis looking smart; ESPN looking dumb.
luvnbayes::When I heard they were getting Prince for Gay, my first reaction was that they would be fine.  Gay was the least important starter on the team, and his salary, from the day he signed it, was ridiculous.
Grindhouse2413::I wish I could give this statement more than 1 like
Mastadon-person::that's 5 straight at the buzzer for spurs........ idk if my heart can take much more.
hated because i didnt join your favorite team james::SO WHATS THE EXCUSES NOW?  -LEBRON
clipctb::The lineup of Bayless, Quincy, Daye, Arthur, and Davis are a +20 over the last two games.  Hope Hollins rolls with that lineup a little more.  Great "D" by Allen on Tony at the end of the game!  These Grizzlies got all the pieces to win this thing with the right breaks!
mpres1973::The light was red when the ball was in his hands. Point is mute.
Sonic_Sooner::While I'm glad the Grizz won, that was HORRIBLE defense on the last possession.  It started with Gasol committing a fundamental mistake, in letting the in-bounds pass get thrown toward the basket.  FUNDAMENTAL mistake.  With 0.8 seconds left, the tall guy on the in-bounds passer has to stand between the passer and the basket with his hands up, making the in-bounds pass receiver catch the ball further from the basket.  Parker was able to catch the ball, moving TOWARDS the basket, about 10 feet away from the goal.  It's a catch and shoot situation.  Parker got a good screen, but Allen has GOT to fight OVER that screen and pressure the shooter.  It was amazing that Parker got such a good shot off in that situation.  Good offensive execution and a good play call by Pop, but HORRIBLE defense.
Ivanov21::Serious question for slam_dunk : why ohh why do yo keep coming back ?! a few months ago your trolling was pis.sing off a lot of Spurs fans, but right now , come on.. it's time to retire, you've had your "shine" !

georgepan::Spurs fans, serious question.  Are you ACTUALLY ok with Pop constantly sitting his best players and losing winnable games, thereby endangering home court advantage?   That home court advantage is now strongly in jeopardy, as on Thursday OKC, at their house, will have a great chance to draw even with the Spurs in the L column while holding the conference record tie breaker.   Given that the Spurs are only .500 away from home over their last 24 away games (12-12 record) isn't that "rest" habit actually endangering your entire season?   What if the strategy fails miserably, and the Spurs lose against OKC 4-3, courtesy of that one extra home game the Thunder have?    IMO, these are idiotic moves, inexcusable, actually.
Trace2010::You're asking too many silly "what if" questions.  Spurs have not lost a series that has gone to 7 games in their playoff history.  At least in the Duncan era...
RealZoo::<b>In this day and age of 'what have you done lately' , Spolestra has been to the last 2 NBA Finals. Pop has been a no-show since 2007...that's actually a long time ago.</b>
Trace2010::georgepan - Simple question, yet you can't answer.  I'll ask again, condensed:  Are you ok with Pop constantly sitting his starters because of back-to-backs and because of that lose winnable games like tonight or against the Wolves and several other occasions, giving away home court advantage?  If that were the Heat on the verge of losing home court advantage because Spoelstra thinks the top players are too soft and can't handle the "pressures" of back-to-backs, I would be extremely upset with him.  Home court is important, just look at history, look at the respective home records vs. the away records of all the contenders.  Ask me again when Spolestra wins his 4th title.
RealZoo::@georgepan....It's a very good question, I've always wondered the same thing. What I have learned is that Pop has Spurs fans brainwashed into believing that he can do no wrong.
