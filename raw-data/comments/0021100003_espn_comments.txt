sabermetricsAreRight::God Laker fans are dumb. Kobe in an all time sense is better than a lot of people who are better than him right now. Just like right now Novak Djokovic is better than Roger Federer but of course Federer is better all time. But neither Kobe nor Roger is the best at their craft right now.
MEEENMACHINE::Sorry Laker Fans !   It sure looks like the NBA is not interested in you anymore . After nixing the trade and seeing that the Bulls were given home field advantage in LA. , when the refs swallowed their whistles(3 horribly missed calls on one possession in a 10 second span)..Face it Lakers fans the NBA is interested in marketing new blood !
53Kevin::more laker fan excuses.same excuses that were made when lakers got swept by mavs.same lame $@% excuses laker fans make everytime lakers lose.
kartkid024::3 calls huh.  Really.
Gp2TheWiseOne::why does everyone hate Kobe Bryant he is the best player in the league.
justinbrooks509::KOBE IS DONE no more rings no more awards just a gradual slide into irrelavence
hatenorv::dude, even kobe knows hes not the best player any more. no offense to kobe, im a big lakers fan, but hes 34 now and u cant say that hes better than a cp3. And u cant use rings when comparing a 14 year vet and younger players like cp3 or durant
ThisisMike305::lol the rings argument is so dumb . It has merit when your ranking all time but as in right now it has no type of merit.
Gp2TheWiseOne::How so, individual achievements mean nothing....im sure Barkley, Dan Marino, Karl Malone and a list of other players that have all the individual achievements would give them up any day without any thought to be called a champion.
Gp2TheWiseOne::yeah that's what that the name we gave him but he was not a dynamic player like kobe even though he has the rings.....also i don't think he is in the league read my first message, is i said in the league!
madewunmi::your post is flawed. thats taking in his achievements. you can say "kobe bryant has been the best player out of anyone currently in the league" i wont argue with you there. but RIGHT NOW. rose is better, wade better, lebron is better, dirk might be better, kd is better, dwight howard is better, chris paul is better, melo might be better.
ThisisMike305::by your reasoning robert horry is the goat. you fail
ThisisMike305::lol i cant stop laughing that was a good one bro
madewunmi::i love the championship argument kobe fans bring up. best player is not a lifetime achievement award. kobe as of now is not a top 5 player. yea he will probably be the best player out of that list in the hall of fame but if were talking now then no way!
Gp2TheWiseOne::now add all of their championships up and let me know if the have 5 or more.
ThisisMike305::well i can name 5 players that are better. Only laker fans think kobe is 1. Dwade,Lebron,Durant, Rose, Dwight, CP3 are all better.
Gp2TheWiseOne::well you tell me who is?
Deamonta Young::I'm not surprised that my Bulls won and I'm not surprised that the Lakers played as well as they did.  All this talk of the Lakers "demise" is just plain stupid.  They won't be as good as they have been in the past few years but they will still be a force in the Western Conference no doubt.  Kobe did his thing even with the bum wrist because thats what Kobe does and thats what I expect him to do.  D. Rose and Loul came up big when they needed to and got us the win.  All the people badmouthing Kobe need to shut up though.  So what if he said he could score 28 in his sleep its true when it comes to big games and it was pretty Jordan like of him.  This is coming from a guy who was old enough to see the Bulls win their last three championships, who stuck by them during those horrible post Jordan years and is wearing a D. Rose MVP shirt but Imma tell you Kobe is the closest thing that the NBA has had to Jordan since Michael retired.  You don't need to agree with what I'm saying but I'm just stating facts.  Go Bulls.
madewunmi::the lakers are a force only because the only really established king i might see emerge is oklahoma. the rest are the field. clippers will take time. grizzlies have got to mature. everything is in flux. the east is no longer a junior conference. they are now kings.
ronron99322::I agree, lakers lost the gm period drose should have never even had a chance 2 win the gm. yeah it stings but i think kobe is still kobe but of course he slower but he will still put a beating on 90% of the teams in the NBA
sugafreee86::lakers will finish with the best record in the west conf. book it.
madewunmi::not if the thunder, grizzlies, and clippers have anything to say about it.
Bede Bears::Taj Gibson is a better overall player than Carlos Boozer. The Bulls need Boozer's offense, but Gibson is a better overall player. I'd sooner Amnesty Boozer and extend Gibson to a nice, modest, contract than pay 30 year old Boozer $15 million a year.  -Bulls Fan
alphamonad::Obviously the Bulls don't think so. The magic offered them Dwight Howard for Boozer and Noah and Chicago turned it down.
53Kevin::See,he can't come up with a link to this.Just shows you how fans make stuff up to show they are smart when in reality they are just plain liers.
Bede Bears::Where did you read this? Please post the link if you can find it.
goirish179::Bulls win Lakers lose (by Kobe getting blocked).  What a great day.
giltis::Kobe looks old
scante31::So you consider it a great day when the Lakers lose in the regular season? Do you cry like that f.aggot did about britney spears on utube when they win a championship? You must be a mess with makeup running down your face on those days. Must make u pee ur pants a little every time kobe misses a shot.
madewunmi::yo scante u mad brah?
Toyonaka3115::Bulls win Lakers lose (by Kobe getting blocked).    What a great day.
Kobe_and_2012Lakers::Lakers 2012 NBA Champs
goirish179::according to laker fans only
PelhamRange::On X-Box maybe
PelhamRange::I've never heard a more arrogant professional athelete than Kobe.  I think a good beating would do him a world of good.
Luclongley_MVP::Kobe should call MJ and ask for advice on how to win on Christmas.    Enjoy the early playoff exit Laker fans.
shremaster::Bulls won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
goirish179::KOBE GOT BLOCKED!!
3PeatKB24::Lakers lost
Frank38443::Deng traveled!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
53Kevin::Kobe travel every possession.
bigwillie317::BALLS WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
gsgeier::LICKERS LOST!!!
super red espresso snowflake::Kobe is the biggest dorkbag in all of sports.  "i can get 28 in my sleep".  anyone can get 28 if you're allowed to shoot it 30 times, moron.
Frank38443::The whole point though is that 47.8% is a good FG% and super red is just hating
Frank38443::<b>I NEVER SAID IT WAS MORON. LEARN HOW TO READ AND DISTINGUISH USERNAMES</b>
bigwillie317::AND YET, NOT RIGHT AT 50%, LEARN TO READ AND UNDERSTAND NUMBER ORDER
3PeatKB24::@BigWill it was easy and any dunce knows 11-23 isnt 50% I said right at, read my post.
bigwillie317::SO WHY DIDNT YOU SAY BELOW 50% THEN, CAUSE THATS WAT IT IS. DONT BE MAD CAUSE YOU WROTE SOMETHING YOU DIDNT MEAN
3PeatKB24::It was me and I am great in math but he didnt get my point so oh well :)
Jason_ninenine::bigwillie you look like an idiot. just stop
bigwillie317::RIGHT AT 50% AND ACTUALLY GETTING TO 50% IS NOT THE SAME, NOW IS IT?
Frank38443::yeah you said right at/right near
3PeatKB24::If Kobe shoots 20+ shots and makes 45% or better I am good with it, like 9-20 BigWill that is 45% I did that without a Calculator!
bigwillie317::THATS EASY YOU DONT NEED A CALCULATOR FOR THAT
Frank38443::47.826087% happy willie? :P
Frank38443::IT WASN'T EVEN ME WHO SAID IT
bigwillie317::IM JUS STATING FACTS, UNLIKE YOU
3PeatKB24::Whatever, even 11-24 is ok by any shooter ever which is 46%. Ive seen Jordan shoot 12-30 or around that alot and everyone thought that was great, so who cares.
3PeatKB24::I said right at, not 50%, you need to learn English, 11-23 is close
bigwillie317::11-23, IS NOT 50%, IT BELOW 50%, SO THEREFORE, U NEED A CALCULATOR!!
3PeatKB24::Kobe shot right at 50% 11-23! What's your point?
Frank38443::close enough to 50% where a hater has no room to be hating
bigwillie317::U NEED A CALCULATOR
Ksj1200::It was pretty awesome watching half the bulls team block hobe out on that last shot. put a fork in "kobe the closer", this is the beginning of the end lake show fans
giltis::16 years of wear and tear on Kobe's knees.  He's noticably a step slower.... especially on defense.  It's a beautiful thing.  Time waits for no one.
Frank38443::Yep, that's it folks. Ksj1200 says we're done must be over
kurbstomper17::The girl from Eagle Colorado wishes she could have blocked Kobe. Deng
Frank38443::Betting line for tonight Lakers vs Kings: Lakers -2.5
Rambomonster9::Grandpa bryant with 2 turnovers and 2missed shots down the stretch. Deng packed him
AustinElli15::I like turtles
Rambomonster9::True
Frank38443::then Deng traveled and it didn't get called
Frank38443::Yeah you're right the refs should just ignore an obvious traveling violation at a critical juncture in a one possession game. It only changed the entire outcome of the game, no big deal
Ingeniously Colossal::The Lakers were getting all the calls all night, don't even dare mention calls. Bulls outplayed the Lakers and the refs.
McSorlee::Not only travelled a blatant...wtf...travel. Maybe the refs were surprised because they've never seen one that bad before. Who knows who cares.
Frank38443::Lakers vs Bulls 3rd most watched regular season game ever on ABC
McSorlee::So I guess the basketball universe does revolve around the Los Angeles Lakers. Not surprising as it always has. People can be mad at it all they want but facts are facts.
Frank38443::Lakers vs Heat '04,'10 were the only ones ranked higher
bigwillie317::WE ALREADY READ THAT, BUT THANKS THO
Frank38443::speak for yourself
goirish179::Vanessa Bryant:  "Trust me, he was never very good in the cluth".
bigwillie317::"CLUTH"? CAN I GET A RULING?
Rondo_for_Life::I would use my amnesty clause on Boozer.
youngmac123::Taj gibson is carlos boozer with better defense..so gibson&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;boozer
PW-52::As sad as it is, they can't afford to lose him. They have no one else. Gibson can't give you 48 minutes.
bigwillie317::IN 2 SEASON W/O CHRIS PAUL,  D. WEST ONLY AVERAGED 5 POINTS PER GAME
Rondo_for_Life::Wasn't Boozer coming off of injuries when he was signed? Hasn't he been prone to injuries? I would take a 10M gamble vs. a 15-20M gamble.
PW-52::David West coming off an ACL surgery is scary IMO.
Frank38443::The question is, is David West still reliable?
Rondo_for_Life::They should have tried to get David West.
Frank38443::Better to have Odom getting kicked out of Mavs games than to be moping around our team and doing dumb stuff as a Laker
Frank38443::,
PW-52::.
goirish179::In a season like this each win is even more important.  Great statement win by the Bulls.  It's early, but still a solid statement win. Kobe looked old!
Frank38443::Great statement win compliments of the refs
PW-52::Lol, if the Bulls play like that the rest of the season, Miami is going to wipe the floor with them. Just sayin.
PW-52::The game had a rough ending yesterday, however there were a lot of positive signs out there. Once Bynum comes back, it will be interesting to see how their defensive schemes look, and how they execute on offense. At the end of the day, it was the first regular season game of the year. With a new coach, new players, new system, and without a top player, it was amazing they were in a position to win. Not that there is any excuse for them losing, however they can take a lot of positives from that game.
dwebbz22::I'm surprised boozer didn't pull an ovary muscle
Frank38443::Boozer is a washed up bum
goirish179::nope.  he still did enough to help beat LA in LA!!
yosi24::lolol!!!!
yosi24::anyways, lakers looked really good yesterday  it's blasphemous to say, but mike brown really is a better defensive coach than phil  kobe looks explosive, and bynum is in incredible shape (dude looks jacked)  i just hope we don't start 0-3 (Rose Tyreke and Harris on consecutive nights to start the season is tough)
kobynum::For some reason the lakers seem to have trouble against the bobcats and the kings... hopefully that's not the case this season lol
Frank38443::fortunately we only play the Bobcats once this season, lol
yosi24::the kings have straight up owned us the last couple years  it's basically game 7 of the finals whenever the lakers come to town  i won't be remotely surprised if they lose (i'd put $100 on the kings if i were a gambling man)
Frank38443::It actually helped to get rid of Odom too. He was the "glue" guy on the team and they really needed to find a way to be forcefully removed from their comfort zone. They just got too stagnant, routine, and boring.
kobynum::we can beat the kings, even though we always have trouble against them :P and i htink we can handle the jazz
kobynum::i say we go 2-2 till bynum comes back
TubbyTime334::DROSE!!!
bigwillie317::D BLOWS!!
Stoshmore23::you blow!
Rondo_for_Life::Tubby would agree with this, " Rondooooooo!"
bigwillie317::COACH TH ESE!!
Rondo_for_Life::OR MAYBE HE WOULD SINCE HE COACHED HIM.
bigwillie317::OR MAYBE NOT
kobynum::WCF= Lakers Vs. OKC  ECF= Knicks Vs. Heat  Knicks vs OKC finals.  That would be an awesomee finals!
goirish179::BULLS
kobynum::Celtics? if rondo steps up his game that actually could be a possibility
yosi24::lol give me the bulls or the celtics  don't wanna see tyson chandler again
kobynum::of course i would want to see a lakers vs knicks finals but that won't happen.
johnrowley12::Too Big, Too Strong, Too Fast, Too Good!  GO BULLS!
stthorpe::I want to go higher!!!
bigwillie317::GO BALLS!!
hh626::those justin bieber nba promos were pretty cool
Frank38443::Yeah, he's just a really really cool guy
kobynum::no. dont wanna see one more drummer boy promo. LOL
bigwillie317::@ BILL IF I CAN TYPE HOW I PLZ, WHY YOU ON MY BACK THEN?
bigwillie317::THERE IS NO REPLY UNDER YOUR LAST POST
Bill67125::LOL, you are too funny.  thank you, i needed a good laugh today.
Bill67125::also, try using the "reply" feature to respond to a thread.  cheers.
Bill67125::i'm sure you will get the hang of this internet thing eventually.  keep trying.
bigwillie317::NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE THEM
bigwillie317::SPEAK UP BI TCH!!
Tizzie11::I wonder what skip bayless has to say now ...." Clutch gene"
Rondo_for_Life::Anyone think Lamar is having trade request remorse right now?
yosi24::so mad at lamar  that's so pathetic (whaaa whaaa i can't believe you traded me for a superstar!)  didn't danny ainge tell rondo he should be honored to be in the chris paul trade rumors haha  thanks lamar but we wont miss you
Frank38443::We don't need him. He always disappears in the playoffs anyway
kobynum::Why did lamar get thrown out yesterday? i was watching the game w/o any volume cuz my friend didn't wanna hear the commentators rip on the mavs. xP
Frank38443::That's a perfect example of what you call cutting off your nose to spite your face
3PeatKB24::I cant believe he got thrown out! LOL! He is so low key.
Yungdubz27::When making your top ever list, what has more weight, accomplishments or skillset or even era's?
Yungdubz27::Yea but is Bill Russell really top 10 all time or are we going by championships alone? Cause to me Bill Russell would be like Ben Wallace in todays game...thats why I say its hard to judge people from different era's can the past players play at a high level in this day and age??
kobynum::true man.
yosi24::era and championships are the most important  if melo played in the 60s he'd average 100  no shot clock, no 3 pt line, and no 7 footers = irrelevant historically  only wilt west and russell really matter from that era
kobynum::i think its era's. you can't tell how different players would fare in different times.
RunTheBall22::Why do you live in the past Kobynum? Its a new season and nobody cares how many rings Kobe has won. You can post his stats all day it's not going to change what happend yesterday or the fact that he is getting old! Live in the now and right now it's D Rose time. youngest MVP ever.  write that one down buddy
kobynum::today its:  1. Lequit 2. Wade 3. Rose 4. Melo 5. Kobe  well at least in my opinion... idk if im forgetting anyone
kobynum::i was trying to make a point that kobe is in the top 10. i agree kobe is out of his prime but he still can kick a$$. d-rose is good and killed my lakers yesterday (heartbreaking :'(....) but anyways i wasn't trying to argue kobe is still the best today, but he ranks in the top 10 all time.
bigwillie317::@ BILL  THE LAST TIME I CHECKED, THIS WAS A FREE COUNTRY, WHICH MEANS I CAN TYPE HOWEVER THE FU CK I WANT. PRETTY MOUTH
bigwillie317::AND I CAN TYPE HOW I PLZ, DONT LIKE, BOUNCE THEN, PRETTY MOUTH
Bill67125::not sure if "pretty mouth" is supposed to offend me...  But, yes, you can type how you "PLZ"
LetsGeauxHeauxCFB::it's called "magic"
stthorpe::not hearing but listening
Bill67125::use your inside voice, no need to shout.  we can all hear your message without typing in caps.
Bill67125::it is commonly known that typing by using all caps is also considered shouting.
bigwillie317::HOW DO YOU HEAR SOMETHING THAT HAS NO SOUND?
3PeatKB24::My best players ever due to a discussion earlier are Jordan 1, Magic 2, Kareem 3, Wilt 4, Russell 5, then it gets dicey because you have Bird and Kobe and out of respect for the 80's rivalry I enjoyed I can see putting Bird 6th but Kobe to me is no less than 7th and then you have players like Duncan, Shaq, Hakeem, and West and Big-O??
Ingeniously Colossal::Shaq on Lakers &gt; Kobe on Lakers. This season is looking just like when Shaq left LA, except now Kobe is older. Kobe is more like 10th all-time. Duncan is underrated many people did not even see him live in his prime, and Shaq is ahead of Kobe just on 3 Finals MVPs alone, not even including other accolades. We all like Kobe because we all are looking for the next Jordan and Kobe uses a lot of MJ's signature moves.
yosi24::i just don't see how you can put wilt or russell ahead of kobe  russell won all those titles in the 60s...  you gotta keep wilt out of the top 5, considering he was a historic loser
kobynum::agreed. Kobe is somewhere from 6th-8th all time
Yungdubz27::Fans don't bring up "Its a TEAM game" when talking about Kobe losing in 2 finals....but when I say Kobe beat the favorite teams of the fans on here that is crying....they say its a "TEAM" game------ go figure.
kobynum::its just like the crap they say about tebow
goirish179::BULLS  Never undrestimate D Rose.  Bulls beat you on your home court.   BULLS

Bill67125::not you, because he would have to SHOUT!!!
I am the brain::"What just happened"?               ---Steve Blake---
I am the brain::Kobe got this in just in time for the biggest choke jobs of 2011 New Years Eve show.
bigwillie317::IF UR THE BRAIN, WHY DONT YOU USE IT?
Bill67125::it's the button located under the "Tab" button on your kebyboard. Above the "Shift" button.  Try pushing it, that should do the trick.
LetsGeauxHeauxCFB::Good game last night......turnovers ate the Lakers alive last night......McRoberts and Ebanks are pretty good.......Kobe would have had a great game if he wouldn't have had 8 turnovers.....Fisher needs to no longer start in the NBA. I know D. Rose is a beast, but he was literally doing whatever the hell he wanted to against Fisher.
LetsGeauxHeauxCFB::he never drove to the hoop until the last shot.......there's no excuse for letting a man rain jumpers all in your face
stthorpe::There is no one in the league who can stay in front of him
LetsGeauxHeauxCFB::oh and Lebron James would like you to edit your comment. (See Playoffs 2011, Bulls - Heat.)
PortlandBlazers1004::TV- $300 .....Derrick rose jersey- $80...Seeing Kobe single handedly losing the game for the lakers- PRICELESS
RunTheBall22::love how D rose was going to take that last shot. He didn't even think about passing.
stthorpe::Cuz rose has proved over and over again he can make the big shot, doesn't shy away, loves having the ball in the final seconds...no one in the league id rather have with the ball in crunch time
Maurcus0998::i dont think he would make it twice Deng was the true game winner
Rondo_for_Life::Deng makes for a great Pippen
bigwillie317::CAUSE HES A GUNNER, SHOOT FIRST PG
Bill67125::your caps lock appears to be stuck, try turning it off.  THANKS!!!
Rondo_for_Life::He has that MJ 'competitive fire' inside. I hope he doesn't take up gambling.  Amazing player.
