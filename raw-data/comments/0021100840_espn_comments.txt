MarkMessier1181::The thunder is going to keep it alive tonight against the lowly bucks! The bucks are only on their hot streak because of their weak schedule and they will get a wake uip call tonight! I have a good page for some research on this subject!   http://nbawagers.com/2012/04/betting-strategy-for-oklahoma-city-vs-milwaukee-bucks/
CandySparker::
LoveBasketball101::Durant is a great player in the scoring department, but he averages more turnovers than assists and his defense is average. Not the MVP at all. Top 5 player I would take though.
Erica7825::Durant for MVP!!  You can watch and download nba full matches in here: www.viewbfc.com/js/nba.html
Giggity.iggity::Fuck that
Ardor48::Clutch situations this past two seasons &amp; playoffs, with less than 5 seconds to play:  KD is atrocious 3-23 or 13% while Kobe is 9-19 or 47.4 % from the field. in other words, KD= huge Joke  http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/03/04/kobe-bryant-lebron-james-and-clutch-shooting-when-perception-and-reality-shake-hands/  good day!
SoonersTheDestroyers::Kobe = huge Joke
Antsea91::<b>Achievement Unlocked:The Closer (20)	 Hold the opposing team to 0 points in the final two minutes of regulation, in a non-simulated game.</b>
AndySportsB::THUNDERup!!!
Jonas2Innone::Washington Generals &gt; Raptors
RollThunder35::PaddyPadresFan  If OKC games are fixed, why did we just go on a 3 game losing streak?
jano2412::PaddyPadresfan's life is fixed!
pako1008::because the people bet on thunder, so thunder loss vegas win
SoonersTheDestroyers::$@%!$@%
lakerfan3902::Raptors got close and than started tanking. Smart no one would suspect it.
SoonersTheDestroyers::dumb troll
Spurs4life93::Hey if you want entertainment stop by the Spurs discussion board. A butt hurt Orlando Magic fan is trolling LMAO
cowboyinorange87::nobody here even wants you here....  you are no better than the orlando troll you speak of... you must  have a really pathetic life to sit and troll other teams boards all day....
pako1008::the NBA generated almost $4 billion in basketball-related income,
thanbai206::how can they do this in a NBA game
thanbai206::seriously 24-0 run.. how can this happen when its a 3 point games and suddenly OKC lead by 27
muel5708::LeBron: Leading the Heat in Points, assists, Boards, steals. And DPOY candidate for Heat    Durant: Leading Thunder in Points, and Boards. But Westbrook leads in assists and steals. And Ibaka is the Thunders DPOY candidate
brycemo22::This is why I am worried being a Heat fan, he has to do EVERYTHING! Hopefully everyone will play A game again when playoffs come. If not Lebron cannot lead the whole team
chrishmt0423::bad for the heat that mean other heat players are garbage
pako1008::the nba continue without tim donaghy

Br3tt11::Mbah A Moute will dominate Durant
RollThunder35::yes OKC lost dipsh.it.  But Br3tt11 said Moute would dominate KD, not the OKC team.  Learn how to read.
Rudy_rush20::Didn't they lose that game?
springfresh33::He posterized Hibbert for one and dropped dropped 40 more on Granger
Br3tt11::Why in the hell would Hibbert be gaurding Durant, he's a big! Luc is a wing defender!
springfresh33::Thats what Indy said about Roy Hibbert and Hibbert is 10x the player of Luc
springfresh33::Thabo will rape him tomorrow
T8ke_A_Picture::Durant will probably not get the shooting title. That's the only thing bad about blowing out opponents. Kobe weak team will need him the whole game.
brycemo22::Kobe will need those 30 shots to keep up with the other high scorers in the league too
Pinkycuh::"KD, plz beat the bucks 4 us"  --big 3 in Miami

Chicago Chokings::What a disaster if u paid to watch this game. Pathetic to blow it up like that.
Soonerslive2009::#LETCOLEPLAY!
Robdee999::RollThunder35 - Tired of arguing with Pacer fans, OKC is gonna annhilate Indy.   RollThunder35 - Dude, im sorry.  OKC isnt gonna take Pacers lightly, but we do have a very good team coming off 2 losses with SAS nipping at our heels.  This could get ugly with OKC taking out frustrations.  Also Robdee999, youre coming off as a really big whiner.
Robdee999::Where is the fail whale when you need him. Sorry RollThunder you need to be reminded the most. Slick talking will get you embarrassed. lmao in front of your Thunder friends.....  " I can do this all day, your moves are just gay " - Robdee999
RollThunder35::you really are pathetic saving all those comments.  SAD.
Robdee999::lmao....I know I'm pathetic for going back and shoving your BS back into your face. Don't say it if you don't want it to come back and bite you.
