C Rod70::These trade experts are terrible! They say Monta Ellis is not productive. Um 50% shooting, 21 points, 11 ast, 6 reb, and 3 steals, yeah he's productive to me. Suck it haters
djzedx::CP3 will soon regret this trade and not going to the Lakers..Clippers are fun to watch every now and again, but they're a fluke.. Reminds me of the Chris webber and Mike Bibby haydays with the Kings..Fun to watch but not really a playoff team past the first round..Blake is an oversized small forward that likes to dunk and then wants to get flashy with it..KG in his primes would of put the hurt on him..
RicoSuave925::The Clippers are the Cleveland Browns of the NFL....
RicoSuave925::Blake Griffin is overrated.. Kevin Love David Lee Pau Gasol Ryan Anderson etc are better PF than Griffin..Griffin is just all dunk...
UNC_title_town::Blake can dunk though.
clippsallday::Nd handle the ball very well for a pf, has good footwork nd a MAN down low.
dplunk18::when B. Griffin finally grows up, and stops with all of the "childish" flopping incidents..he will really be an even better ball player.
Clipshow07::Clippers are in big, big trouble. How do you expect to win when you play absolutely ZERO defense????? Most pathetic non-existent rotational defense I've seen in years!!!
clippsallday::As soon as they took bledsoe off ellis they started scoring again. They needa work on the defensive end nd on the rotations.
UNC_title_town::blake can dunk though.
ConstantineK9::monta ellis should get some tattoos
knicks_11::Everyone thought /teams would be scared to come into the Clippers arena...
gt1master_ike::At this point, caron butler is only starting because there is no other option. But really the guy looks like he needs a week off to just recharge.
WarriorsWarrior::wow espn highlights show the clippers making three buckets and the warriors only one, warriors led by 21, and did the clippers really ever have a lead!   NO RESPECT!
CandySparker::Hola Lotta Love!
marvin alston::Is it me, or is that loss column getting heavy Clipps.
AdamSaidThis::8 - 9 since Billups went down.  EVERYWHERE he goes...he is extremely under rated as the real reason the team in question is having success.
nba is the worst::Miss 16 fts, lose by 4  Better get one of those ft angle machines, Sterling!
Allen6338::Rubio ran into Kobe and he is out for the rest of the season. The kobe-system really works:)
nba is the worst::Are you lost?
Allen6338::The Clippers sucks................
workman47::Who owns the Clippers? Do you think it's depressing owning the worst franchise in the history of the NBA?
marvin alston::David Stern says that the league owns the team, but he was the one making the trades and blocking trades so you tell me who ownes the team.
HOLLOW51386::WORSE FRANCHISE IN SPORTS HISTORY.
workman47::You're right, forgive me.
scante31::CP3 = the masked lizard.
Solon_da_ruler::These highlights sucked! Where was the Rush putback dunk? The Monta layup? Where were the Warriors highlights period? They won, didn't they?
Strong Troll Orthenthald::None of this is real
tandyman8::I should be an NBA referee.  Apparently all you need to be able to do is randomly blow your whistle every once and awhile without any sort of consistency to speak of.
U MAD Laker Fans::Alls u need to do is listen to what Stern tells u to do
Birdmann._.::consistency is a game to game thing not a play to play thing
kidkidkobe::jabba
supordupor23::1.  ive never done that 2.  either way, some bro who isn't a warriors or clips fan just spent 3 full hours posting random nonsense on their board.  that is a massive, massive LOL.   3.  i feel sorry for him more than anything else
Birdmann._.::whatever helps you sleep at night
supordupor23::i'm right.  i just scrolled down.  u have been on here for 3 hours straight.  do u have a life?
Birdmann._.::maybe hes working on other stuff too and/or jacking off to porn in other tabs and periodically switching to this window?
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::Don't act like you've neber done it
supordupor23::haven't u been on here for like 3 hours straight?  i think ur mom needs to send u to bed buddy
kidkidkobe::very funny
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::sup
Strong Troll Orthenthald::is any of this real
WarriorsWarrior::Blake  Great Dunker. Good rebounder. Fair Defender. Bad Free thrower. Horrible (commercial) actor!
AdamSaidThis::Blake is over rated. Aggressive dunking makes ESPN excited...but does it really win games?
Allen6338::Blake needs to learn more skills all this dunking is alright for plays on ESPN but if you cannot win what difference does it makes great players like Kobe can dunk handle the ball great on defense and can assist not to mention handle all the negative talk against him day in and day out..
naes666::Blake = one dimensional  and arrogant as hell not giving the Warriors any credit for the win.  "We shouldn't put ourselves in that position in the first place," Griffin said. "But I guess if you could try to take a positive from this, it's that we are capable of coming back against a team like that."
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq4voeNuWEY&amp;feature=relmfu
kidkidkobe::whats the balloon thing?
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::balloon shop -- few guys that make random videos, pretty funny
njchaingang::blake griffin is a glorified stunt man... he brings nothing to the table. shots from 5 feet from the basket. no duh it goes in.
HOLLOW51386::kevin love is way better then him
njchaingang::its a popularity contest... its like in high school. who has the most friends wins. he has a few highlights EVERYONE jumps on the bandwagon. doesnt mean his good.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::it's a shame he'll be the starting PF in the all star game every year
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::@ kidkobe you still here?
kidkidkobe::yea
kidkidkobe::lol
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::i have no idea, everyone just left at the same time i gues..
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::cool
kidkidkobe::where did everyone go?
kidkidkobe::cool
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::just representin' your team/players, totally cool
kidkidkobe::yea man sorry if i said some crazy ish
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::we cool?
Strong Troll Orthenthald::Eat ya vittles children
thunderarenbachamps::any girls on here dtf?
Birdmann._.::&lt;----- ME
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::bird"mann" the girl haaha
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::lol, tons of girls on the internet DTF
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::anyone watch balloon shop?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyNI3GbLCXg
nate.farey::Warriors need to Keep Monta and Trade Curry
nate.farey::While I tend to agree, its hard for me to see him recovering from his injury. His Ankles have been bad since day 1 AAAAND he did just have the longest offseason possible for them to heal
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::probably wait on curry this year tho, if they traded him now they wouldn't get much in return because of him ankle probs
nate.farey::teams like Curry. The Hornets wanted Curry for CP3 straight up. Warriors I regretfully admit, declined
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::I'd trade JJ Barea for him haha
Birdmann._.::they wouldn't get anything at all
kidkidkobe::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYzBGlL3ZQc   kd vs lbj    kd drops 60
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::should i drop Dj Augistine for Evan Turner?
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::yeah i probly will, need assists tho now that rubio is down
nate.farey::RIP Rubio
nate.farey::Yes if its a keeper
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::yes Turner is balling right now
nate.farey::Yeah Lebron has never been clutch............................ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fD1MNjkPFs
nate.farey::1 time. Thats when he led a team of 1 to the playoffs. I would put 1000 down that the heat win it this year
nate.farey::You cant try and tell me that he had a team around him...... He WAS the team when he was on the CAVS. He took them to the Ship singlehandedly. What the heck is up with all the lebron hate? He is top 3 in the league and probably this years MVP
Birdmann._.::so lebron averaged 50+pts a game in the playoffs when with the cavs?  Becuase a 1 man team would have to do that
Birdmann._.::1 time congrats.  thats when he was ok with being a leader
lazyboi637::goodnight all
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::gn boi
gocaliforniabears::Clips are now a joke team without Chauncey. The curse lives on.
kidkidkobe::i think wildcats win it all
Zippppppp::I don't follow the Clippers much but from what I can recall this is like the 3rd game recently Butler has gone ohfer
Birdmann._.::don't hate on butler hes the only one worth keeping on that team
Zippppppp::He has gone 1-10, 0-6, 1-6, 0-6 all in the past 8 games. That is beyond awful.
Zippppppp::I agree and don't really care about them, it's just crazy that an NBA starter can hit 0-X from the field multiple times and continue to start
lazyboi637::welcome to the nba, when old guys stink but still play because of the fraternity.
Iamtheone0594::How come KMart did not play?
lazyboi637::no need to follow. they are irrelevant
RicoSuave925::Manning is gonna sign with the Denver Broncos cause it's a weak a.s.s division and they have a good defense...book it...
FriscoWarriors415::He would not want to play in the same division as the niners.. AZ is a no for manning
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::them or arizona, to play with fitz
Zippppppp::Arizona has no money, Denver can bring his old gang(Wayne and Clark) along with him
madflo30::Manning top choices are teams from winnable divisions. So there's no way he would go to Dolphins and face Brady twice a year.
madflo30::I still can't believe Radiers traded all those picks for Palmer.
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::can't blame em for trying
lazyboi637::manning will wish he never signed with the broncos. AFC WEST defenses are all top notch.
Zippppppp::Houston makes the afc south better, playing them twice is scarier than playing any team in the west. It's pretty weird saying that.
lazyboi637::depends on the notch. but compare to afc south, afc west defense is better
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::there above average but they aren't top notch, specially not San Diego
mrkennedy23::Raiders' defense is top notch?  Really?
mrkennedy23::AFC West is by far the weakest out of any division.
Zippppppp::The division is pathetic, and what defenses with crush him? SD Oak and KC are all mediocre defenses and none have a dominant pass rush
lazyboi637::offensively fail. but defense will crush manning and his immobility
Birdmann._.::considering the broncos can tank the last part of the season and still make it he will probably go there
RicoSuave925::Manning is not going to play for the Miami Dolphins cause he doesn't  wanna get overshadow by Lebrons 8 rings...
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::Peyton doesn't give two hoots about LBJ, he'll go whereever he wants
