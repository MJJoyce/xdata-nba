CodBlu::I wish I could have seen the game.  I like Jeff Green, and think he can be a superstar, if he can just get consistent.  By looking at the stats, it would appear that he didn't show up to play hard AGAIN, frustrating.
Anton::Celtics are make playoffs Nets lottery...
Mel::I think we have to be patient with Boston.  Right now with a new coach and many new teammates they are doing better than what anyone would have expected.  When Rondo is back I think we will nail these close ones and go into the playoffs over .500
Michael ZZ::Gunner Crawford at it again. 3-15, 1-7 3's when you don't have it stop shooting tool !! Another long month till Rondo returns.
PKM::Why did I just pickup Lou Williams?
Michael ZZ::Another big lead down the tubes. Can't wait till Rondo returns.
Garrett::So many phantom calls in Atlanta's favor today. The most crucial was the phantom call on Bradley fouling Teague who shot the 2 free throws to put Atlanta up by 1.
OlaCambada::Brad Stevens puts Bass on Bigger guys but on Milsap he benches him in the 4th as our lead vanishes away with Oly and Hump playing matador D on him.  Brad the Tanker, or Brad the Food. Take ur pic?
Bucky::Celtic fans should NEVER complain about the refs after all the cheat jobs that have gone in their favor for generations.
Naturally Tanned Man::look at the atlantic...beyond embarassing. I cant stand it when teams under .500 make the playoffs by default. what a joke
