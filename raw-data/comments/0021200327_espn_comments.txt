retard533::Kwame Brown &gt; Dwight Howard
BlazersWar::George Hill with a triple double! impressive
Kit Ramsey::Are the Pacers in first place yet? LMAO.
Taco with a Q::................
ebattoe::Dear Mr. Walsh, please trade Jermaine O'neill part 2 (Hibbert) for Kevin Love. Throw in whatever you need to make it happen. Horrible contract for what he brings to the table. The team will never be any better than it is now during the life of that contract and look how average we are.
azehr31::love hates the pacers for some reason...said so last year
Taco with a Q::Bulls fan trolling..lmao
Kit Ramsey::I don't blame him.
Timmy Teboww::Paul George or Evan Turner, who's better?
ptglj517::paul george will be a bigger star
Taco with a Q::Dumb question, both are different position players
Taco with a Q::I have an odd feeling that Hill did NOT get a triple double.  I hope the Pacers didnt add one to please the fans
idontfkaround::thank god, i have hill in my fantasy..... free backpacks !!!!!
Rexanilatorz::oh it is correct I just noticed they removed a rebound from Hibberts stat line...There was a play in the 3rd QTR where hibbert and hill were battling for a rebound Hill got it but they gave it to hibbert for some reason
Taco with a Q::Oh well good
Rexanilatorz::Who cares got 1000 backpacks donated!
charlie rawn::Paul George is turning into a star right in front of us!
EastCoastSurfing::dude had me scared those first few games.
Kit Ramsey::Lucky streak, he will get back to sucking soon, just watch.
bengalsrgay43034::Good game!!! We looked pretty good, very excited about paul george these last few games.  Philly looks pretty impressive as well, they are going to be so good with bynum and holliday back.  Two very young teams with lots of upside, maybe in a few years when the elite teams in the east get older, these two teams can become a lot like the pacers and piston rivalry 8 years ago.
Rexanilatorz::ESPN says George Hill has 9 rebounds and NBA website says 10 rebounds for George Hill lol
Ahmed B.::why jason richardson only get 20 min?
Rexanilatorz::no
Ahmed B.::did he get hurt?
Ahmed B.::he was getting 30 minutes a game
Rexanilatorz::because this isn't 2003
superman253540::76ers are trash and so are Philly sports fans
Rexanilatorz::@Pacers Another rebound was added to @George_Hill3's stat line. He finished with his 1st career triple-double. 15 pts, 10 asts, 10 rebs  YAY
Taco with a Q::It was???
screwhead2305::does philly not have a point guard?
The Knicks could not win against their own teddy bears::Jrue Holliday normally is, but he is injured.
The Knicks could not win against their own teddy bears::How are the Nets losing to the Pistons?
Taco with a Q::Nets are overrated thats why
philswin08::james harden is the real deal
The Knicks could not win against their own teddy bears::Artest needs the ball more.  He can pick and roll with Jermaine O'neal.
ptglj517::pre-brawl, artest was averaging something crazy like 25 pts, 6 rebs, 4 assts, 3 steals.  what a year it could have been....
back off bro::remember the people who got shot in the 6ers stadium?
PhillyDJ215::who? get your $@%!$@ story straight,
Rexanilatorz::D-League Update for Pacers fans: Plumlee has 8 points and 10 rebounds with 4 minutes left in the 3rd QTR for the Mad Ants
Rexanilatorz::now 10 points so he has a double-double!
Rexanilatorz::Paul George is 10  points away from passing David West for leading scorer on this team
Taco with a Q::The way PG has been playing I believe that
piercejohnson3411::neither of these teams are getting past the first round, even if they end up making the playoffs
piercejohnson3411::I just said if all the teams are healthy..and don't even get me started..knicks are western conference good. Different team this year, they're legit.
Reds30417::The only team I really don't see the Pacers being able to beat in the East is the Heat. In a playoff series. NY up there too
Reds30417::Without Rose the Pacers can beat the Bulls.. They just beat them the other night, still without Granger.
Kit Ramsey::Without RIP also, with D.Rose and RIP it's no contest even with a healthy Granger.
piercejohnson3411::they have key pieces, but they're not beating the knicks, bulls, heat or celtics..if they're all completely healthy..imo
Kit Ramsey::^^ Really? Then why are they in 3rd place in the central? The Pacers are overrated if anything.
MasterOfLogic::They already beat the Bulls on the road...  both Chicago and Boston are overrated.
Taco with a Q::Pacers play the Celtics well actually
The Knicks could not win against their own teddy bears::The Knicks choke in the playoffs.^^^^^^
Taco with a Q::Pacers will win the Central
Kit Ramsey::Ha,ha,ha, LMAO, u are in 3rd place, shut up already.
JNK17::they' both have key pieces out right now, give em a chance.  although i wouuld say the pacers have a much better chance
Reds30417::And of course if Bynum comes back for Philly
piercejohnson3411::good, but not great
Reds30417::Especially when Granger comes back for Indy
matt25485::i disagree, when both teams are healthy they are good teams
The Knicks could not win against their own teddy bears::Granger would make the team about 50% better.  And If Hibbert plays like he did today, the Pacers have a chance to get at least to the confrence semis.
matt25485::anyone wanna join me in trolling the lakers board for only beating washington by 6?
Taco with a Q::Trolling is for losers
The Knicks could not win against their own teddy bears::Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!  Release Gerald Green!
Pat_Taggart::I am impressed at the people on this board. They really articulate their thoughts.
Pat_Taggart::If you had done you're homework (clicking on my name), you would know that my team had, in fact, won.
The Knicks could not win against their own teddy bears::Well, I have low self esteem and I do not care what you think.  By the way, your team lost.

potato623::All the cities teams suck...blows right now. Only thing going is Danny Garcia
philswin08::at least there's sooo many good places to eat in philly
Rexanilatorz::Roy HIbbert shot over 50% for the first time this season!!! YEAH!!
JNK17::think he'll show up again before the new year?
leo9212::and got alot of rebounds
The Knicks could not win against their own teddy bears::Other than being able to dunk, Gerald Green has shown complete ineptitude in the NBA.  He does not know how to play even though he is physically talented.
Taco with a Q::Pacers got called for 21 PF and the sixers for 20, yet you guys wanna say the refs did it for us
piercejohnson3411::put jru in there and they also come out with the win..it's just one game, no worries
potato623::I don't care if it's one game, we played like dirt cause we are dirt, going nowhere slow.
xkizarux::pacers had 5 favorable calls/no calls that gave them 8 points. especially the offensive charges against thad and brown. take that away and the sixers walk out with a win.
matt25485::dude just take the L like a man, stop trying to blame the refs
leo9212::lol fail math
potato623::Uhh no, we just can't rebound.
brockness22::Well they won by 10
Pat_Taggart::I'm not sure your math is right.
potato623::I'm sorry..uhhh who the f### is saying that? Idiot
potato623::Oh okay...well shut up Kizaru haha
Taco with a Q::A couple of your fans... .IDIOT!!!
leo9212::one of the sixers fan is def saying that
IggyIsClutch::Kizaru keeps blaming the refs
PhillyDJ215::im sorry man, collins cant coach
leo9212::He got no players man give that man some credit
JNK17::agree, they were playing all role players tonight.  even with bynum their talent level is just mediocre.
potato623::What? Blasphemy, our players can't score
Rexanilatorz::your joking right? he is a fantastic coach
IggyIsClutch::Paul George really looks legit! Need to watch out for the pacers when they are healthy
The Knicks could not win against their own teddy bears::Release Gerald Green!
potato623::Lost 5 of our last 7...c'mon Doug, gotta get this team going
Rexanilatorz::Gerald Green ruins everything
leo9212::fk you Gerald Green let hill get the Rebound you bum. 1000 backpacks for children
azehr31::they werent going to foul anyway  lol
leo9212::Hill needed the last rebound for the that, but you know Green has to have that rebound
ballerbooboo::turner expect the ref to give him the call everytime if not hes gonna cry about it...ell turner you ain't kobe or lebron ..not even all star level yet. ..
potato623::Turner's all-star level, but he shouldn't play like that
SeanKelley5::Yes he is
BarrySandersfan21::Allen, brown, and hawes  58mins 7 rebounds  Evan Turner had 10rebounds in 40mins
nothing better than a german shepherd dog5::47 good minutes from turner, george hill torched him last min
potato623::Don't know what's wrong with that Bynum, but if he isn't here by January we have to start looking for a trade
leo9212::there is no way he is going to be back by that. His return is not specified that usually means its a serious thing
leo9212::I think Even if he comes back he will not be back to what he was. And then he gets mad at the coach because he wants him to play D how dare him day that word D
potato623::He said a month at worst just yesterday, not going to take his word but just saying.
leo9212::Let hill get rebound 1000 backpacks for children!!!!!!!!1
philswin08::ha what?
leo9212::If Hill that triple double 1000 backpacks would have been donated for the children
potato623::True story, if the season ended today we'd be out of the playoffs
xXxPryor2xXx::Turner is a beast. Haters lol
raytowson::turner you suck
leo9212::That one Sixers fan is going to blame the refs for that turnover
xkizarux::No, Turner coughed the ball up, but it doesn't change the fact that it was the REFS who won this game.
Taco with a Q::Stop!!  Just stop!!
ballerbooboo::nah we blame turner for crying too much during the game...
ballerbooboo::tuner is a cry baby....go play some defense...cried and then turn ball over then cried again
SeanKelley5::Hansbrough is a pusy
philswin08::ha if you heard the sixers announcer just go "george hill" about sums it up tonight
nittanynation16::At least my favorite college team doesn't give up huge runs like this.  Oh wait...
matt25485::haha your favorite college team would be better off just getting rid of its basketball program
dlskdlsldksl::90% OF THEIR POSSESSIONS ARE TURNOVERS.
IggyIsClutch::Good game but damn I hate injuries
Taco with a Q::I hear ya man
