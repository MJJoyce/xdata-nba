CodBlu::Unlike most people I have believed in Boston all the way and have repeatedly said that they will have a decent year.  I believe we are seeing Boston right now as a decent team in spite of being a new team with a new coach.  Miami will probably roll over Boston like a freight train would a bum, but that won't last long.  Boston will be back on top.
malrubius::Yeah!  The Boston Generals are ahead of the Orlando Generals!
brian::We're coming after you, Miami Heat! Celtics Pride BABY!!
edward::Orlando to match Miami at top of Southeast. Boston looks like a bottom feeder with this lineup.
John::Boston should play more of Pressey, the dude can play.
Steve::Vucevic is best big man in the game right now.
RedtongKid::Magic's got a good young team...but Celtics'll win tonight. Let's Go Celtics!!!
Jared::Davis is out with a "sore foot." Can we just cut that cry baby already? Vucevic is a much better producer and certainly won't be out with a "sore foot." This guy makes millions, get your #$%$ out there and play.
clint::Wallace gives 100% effort and he's a 6,6,6 guy.  6 pts, 6 rebounds and 6 fouls.
twade617::solid win celts. play hard in Miami come back  home and rattle off 3 in a row on the home stand
