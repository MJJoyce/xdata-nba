mn_tanz::Seeing the wolves without Rubio just reinforces my belief that he would have been more deserving of ROY without his injury.  Everyone knew he could pass and his creativity and effectiveness that way far outdid his poor shooting and energized the team.  But his contributions on the defensive side were huge.    WIthout Rubio, the team yet again gives up more than 110 points and looks more and more like the team that was the worst defensive unit in the NBA last year.  Love doesn't deserve MVP, Adelman *might* deserve COY, but Rubio definitely would have deserved ROY if healthy.
luvnbayes::mn_tanz, you are a wise man.  4-10 since Rubio's injury.  My only small quibble is that Adelman wouldn't deserve COY in any event, because anybody would have been an improvement over the triangle-addled Rambis.  But Rubio is who made the Wolves go, and let's just hope he comes back 100 percent so he can do the same.  And yes, they miss him more on the defensive end than on the offensive.
phunky58::you know if minnesota knew how to manage their personnel better they would win more games.  this is a prime example.   (by that i mean putting the right guys on the floor).   hats offf again to isaiah thomas love what he is doing in sacramento.  great draft pick

Eric62748::Wolves fans finally done talking about the playoffs??? You guys suck and need to quit dreaming of the playoffs. It aint happening this year or next.
mn_tanz::It'll happen next year. This year was always a long shot, but they were on pace to make it before Rubio tore his ACL.    So, thinking playoffs... not unrealistic.
