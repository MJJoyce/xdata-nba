Anton::So Chris Copeland is a secret weapon in the playoffs?
Travis J::The Pacers bench is better then last years, which was terrible, but it's still not that great. Odviously when/if we get Granger back that should be a big boost, but until then the Pacers are going to continue to have some nights like this, where they lose leads.
Jules::Wow, it's unfortunate that the rookie don't have his picture up when he's the featured player. Good things coming from both teams - Sixers might have some promising pieces to build on, plus the Pacers are scary good now. It seems all those butt-spankings from the Heat have shown them they need to control their emotions and play disciplined basketball.
Darth Apollyon::Pacers vs Heat is a sure bet, and I do not see any team in the West beating the Spurs.  They should just jump ahead to the Conference Finals and save us from the rest of the meaningless season.  Or they could do reruns of the past season and just play lives the games seven of the Eastern conference Finals and NBA Finals so we can start the next season already.
Ryan::Indiana will cruise to an easy win in this one.
chuck d::Pacers play great TEAM basketball, could go all the way
HelloWorld::Pacers - Spurs finals. Its gonna be an awesome team vs team battle.
fcbonilla::This should be a good game. If I could I would by the NBA package just so I could watch every Pacer game. I can not wait for the Pacer to come to Miami to play the Heat so I could see them match up in person.
PKM::Indiana is balling
Jeff::Well, with the Rose situation, we will not have to sift through Bulls trolls comments.
