cleveland eats poop::i like nutsack bouncing off my cornhole! thumbs up!
pmmn63::Are we not giving sessions to much credit as a great pg,last night he was great but he never plays great most of the time with a clunker here and there,till last night he's been Ramon,ok poor mid range game and better at 3's this year but in spurts,he's a good fit for this team but if he was better than kyrie scott would start him,he's decent to me not really good imo
mike564255::have good day
mike564255::all i want is a ring before the cheat and it's going to take some bulls some grant and some luck but it's possible
PMTF::metoo mike same for thye browns but before  die
wtfiuwts::To be fair, Sessions was never going to start over Irving. You don't put the #1 pick on the bench in the NBA, at least not in this day and age.
PMTF::scott would to bring him along and sessions is ok to me but not really goos too inconsistent,scott has made him better imo
KingGeorge53::All true my man.    that's why you're the "pmmn63"!    haha    Any rate, the simple problem is, finding a pg to backup isn't easy.   Look at LA Lakers.
cleveland eats poop::King George got busted by his mommie talking about anal sex
KingGeorge53::Bro!   YOu got your old identity back for the ALL Star push?
PMTF::But George the lake show under phil never made point guards,they ran a triangle for kobe and he like mike brown ran systems not developed talent imo
pmmn63::gibbs can do that if you find a 2 that can fill it up and play d
mike564255::i think andy will be alright for 5 6 more..get rid of sessions for lakers first they're on kobe and new coach timer and know they can build from free agency and dont need to draft..call up manny harriss get him some pt this year..and i hope no matter who we get we keep running more than 2 full lineups
KingGeorge53::However, maybe Sessions is now just realizing if he plays well enough, he could be playing with the best player in the NBA in LA?
KingGeorge53::Let me rephrase that.... best winning player.    leBron may be the best athlete, but he can't finish.
KingGeorge53::a month ago I wouldn't have wanted LA's pick, but they're slipping.   We might just find a good pick with them headed to the middle of the pack this year.
wtfiuwts::Sessions is a still young, proven commodity in the League who has shown he can put up big numbers. I'm not sure that trading what is easily one of the best back up PG's in the league for a late first rounder that may never pan out is a good idea. Think of it this way - would you trade Sessions for Eyenga straight up? That's what the Cavs might very well end up doing.
KingGeorge53::Mike/wtf.    yes.      I don't think we're as close as you two.    I still love you man.   lol    However I'm thinking more along the lines of what Bruce has been preaching.    However, after seeing Grant's magic in such a short time frame, anything is possible.    And I would be glad to state "I was wrong".     Believe me.    And I want to see Andy retire as a Cavalier.    He's that good, dedicated and a game changer as you've both written.  However, IMO, I think Andy's market will never be better than now.    However, and always is, the concern is can what is traded for bring back what you just sent away?     I'm willing to take that risk b/c I want to contend for a ring, not to contend for a PO spot.   I do NOT want to be like the Hawks, but rather more like the Celtics.
wtfiuwts::Personally I think the Cavs only three untouchables are Irving, Varejao, and Thompson - in that order. Varejao is a game changer.
mike564255::i'd be down but getting rid of andy means we just dug a bigger hole i guess where we differ is i think andy will be around when we can make a run and you dont
wtfiuwts::I'd love to see the Cavs go after this guy in the 2nd round personally. Tall, good mid range game. Worth a shot. http://www.mynbadraft.com/NBA-Draft-Profiles-2012/Tomas-Satoransky
KingGeorge53::They already have a couple of Session like players and at least one that's better than Sessions on that team.   Now... IF they want Andy... and they could use him.    I'd say trade him for a player to get through the end of the season, their #1 this year and a 2 (if they have it) the year after.
wtfiuwts::You said probe..
mike564255::i guess the more i think about it our offense just needs someone who can probe and hit mid rangers and that's not manny
wtfiuwts::Don't get me wrong. If we could trade Sessions to say, the Pistons for their first rounder, I'm all in. Just don't see that happening under any circumstances. Maybe some kind of three way trade could make that happen. Who knows..
mike564255::you know what i i agree..if we can keep him im all for it
wtfiuwts::Not sure Harris will ever be a good enough ball handler or passer to assume that role, if thats what you mean. He has Sessions scoring ability, but not his handle and court vision. And Sessions isn't that that great at either of those either, so that's kind of scary.
mike564255::you;re right one more year but still same story
KingGeorge53::Mike.... pg are a different breed overall.    Who ever would've thunk players like Mo Williams would beg to stay with Cleveland AFTER james left.    I keep hearing more and more that players want to play here.      An owner willing to shell out any kind of cash for a winner, a GM that so far has shown brilliant moves (early sample) and an excellent coach.     What's not to like?
mike564255::i agree but i positive he doesnt want to be backup..i think manny harris is the missing piece in all this
wtfiuwts::I think he has another year or two on his contract.. maybe not. Thought he did.
wtfiuwts::Double edged sword, but as a Cavs fan and knowing the luck of the franchise in general, I hope management errs on the side of caution on this one and keeps the guy they know can contribute.
mike564255::so you think trade sessions for a body?  i just think his contract is up and wont want to be backup so we need something for him
KingGeorge53::I agree.    However, LA is slipping.    Then again, if LA gets Sessions and start him, they may end up contending again.   which means, that pick goes from the middle of the pack to the bottom of the 1st round again.    Which is NOT a good trade as you point out.
wtfiuwts::Seems like someone down there is bitter that Cleveland beat their Clippers. I would have to remind your dumb sack that, well.. it's the Clippers. This is the first time they've been semi-relevant for what - two decades? Or more?
KingGeorge53::I'm not convinced he/she/it is a clipper fan.    He/she/it is more sensitive to the LeBron comments so, I'm thinking it's a but.t hurt James fan.   They got humiliated last night in Orlando AND James keeps humiliating himself with his Tweeter.
KingGeorge53::I even tossed out some Ricky Rubio on that poster and he didn't bite on that.     I'm sure most of it get some satisfaction of seeing Miami get beat, but truth is, no one cares until it gets to the PO.   Seeing Miami get beat by anyone in the PO is fun for everyone.   You don't have to live in Cleveland to get enjoyment with that.
wtfiuwts::I see. In that case - I love it when one of the 'Big 3' is out and the Heat win with 'only' two all-stars. Much more gratifying I'm sure than watching the Cavs beat a good Clippers team when they're down two starters and their back up PF. Haha. If the Heat had half the heart that the Cavs do..
KingGeorge53::Never saw that one bro.     Guess we better speak to the league about wanting more b2b next season.   lol
pmmn63::notice all tems that have to run with the cavs lose in back to backs
mike564255::ok so sessions for a 1st is plausible right?
pmmn63::kyrie,gee,andy,gib and tristan and sess that's it we need a lot
KingGeorge53::I'll agree with you guys on this.     But, tell me what backup PG in the league isn't inconsistent?
pmmn63::me too sess is very inconsisitent
mike564255::i;d throw in eyanga and swap sessions for 1st either shooter or big
mike564255::see i really like manny and think he'll be solid #2 so maybe im banking too much on him
KingGeorge53::HE had a rough start... with an injury.     He's improved, so I'd like to see more of him as the year progresses.   He isn't the answer or the problem.   Just a young kid learning the NBA game.
mike564255::wxcept casspi
KingGeorge53::I like everyone on this team when I see efforts like we've seen this year.
KingGeorge53::I'm all in to trade Andy IF the price is right.    B/c Andy, as Bruce would say, won't be around when Kyrie is ready to run a championship point.
pmmn63::but no team will give away a diamond for a good role player
KingGeorge53::But, IMHO, the Cavs are a few years off at the very least.    By then, a guy like Andy will get hurt more than a few times and will not be worth what he is today.    Again... I can't think of any player on this team that is more dedicated, with more drive and wants to win.
mike564255::he's only 29
pmmn63::not really the top teir teams have no #1 or just bottom first pick
KingGeorge53::true... so we have to find that team that THINKS they're better than they really are.
KingGeorge53::Yes.    If the pick is high enough up.
mike564255::get your life together
