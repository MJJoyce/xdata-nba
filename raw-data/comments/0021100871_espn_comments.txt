EdHart81::The clippers winning will end tonight against the thunder! I hgave why on my blog, a good preview and how to bet it here  http://nbawagers.com/2012/04/the-best-nba-betting-advise-on-the-web-for-thunder-at-clippers/
Soonerhopeful1::Personally and probably what's best for the Wolves; the K Love will not return this season;..Play all your rookies and reserves, deciding whom to keep, trade or release.   Get your draft pick and come back stronger next year... Wolves have talent now for sure.
Jg2.o::What have we learned.....FREE ANTHONY RANDOLPH!!!!
damn334::kevin love after the lose talking about when he will be back to play again http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZlkDAVusjA&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL
knicks_11::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYq6pOpjmws&amp;feature=g-logo&amp;context=G2ca0660FOAAAAAAAOAA   Haha overhyped
yorklinks1::kobe has a .300fg% in the clutch and bynum has an .800fg% MAYBE IF BYNUM TOOK THE LAST SHOT THE LAKERS WUD WIN MOR full clutch rankings here (got stats from here) http://bustasports.com/?p=784
drmcfunk::What is with people speaking for Clippers fans. As a Clipper fan i have never said nor have i heard anyone say that LA is turning into a Clipper town. Or that we are going to win a championship. Even at the beginning of the season everyone said we hope for a playoff run, That's it. We also never called Blake Griffin the best PF in the league although he is easily top 3. Its funny how all you haters claim that the Clippers and Clippers fans make all these claims but i have yet to see one. Show me some evidence people
DeezBrown::Wolves couldn't get it done huh... Not surprised damn clips.
charlie_sheep::what we learned yesterday: the clippers suck and the timberpuppies suck even more
Tom D1946::peckovic played 33 minutes and had no fouls, what's this world coming to?
thenbatmm::Blake Grffin poster serge IBAKA  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aWVGN28gsA
Joe Raygor::Can't help wondering how further ahead the Clippers would've been if Billups didn't go down.
Bynum Leads The League In 3 pt attempts::1-5 free throws from bg? career high!
ent1991::bynum &gt; D12
Bynum Leads The League In 3 pt attempts::yep. bynum can shoot 3s
ent1991::"why couldnt my father pull out...."-------- Queen James
dbackyankeeswinning::I found a betting system a few months back called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I found this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. Thought I would post this for anyone out there that is looking for a betting system that actually works
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::Clippers win, but I still crush.
thenbatmm::D-wade is pretty clutch, something that LEBRON doesnt have....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKQCpwxxxpo
Nikola Pekovics Awesome Tattoo::I no like this, how you say, "D Wade." I smash.
thenbatmm::they should call lebron the MAGICIAN cuz he always DISAPPEAR -.- and we still DONT KNOW WHY   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnsQmpn8m1s
thenbatmm::LEBRON free throws hahaah  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnsQmpn8m1s
thenbatmm::wow CJ WATSON HUGE 3!! WHERE WAS LEBRON  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzjY42bZ7IE
Kristian1067::I love that everyone is hating on the Clips. But the thing is that the wolves had KG and didn't do anything with him. Love is gone at the end of his contract. The Clips have a better chance of signing blake to an extension. And the Lakers after next year are in serious trouble what am I saying after this year.
Bynum Leads The League In 3 pt attempts::delusional clippers fans always talking about things that never happen
Zippppppp::Why do the Clip have a better chance of locking people up? You bring up the Wolves history but fail to remember the Clippers might be the worst franchise in sports.
bpoleschuk::And to the people that said "Blake actually wins games" he fu.cking didn't before chris paul came just like love won when rubio came without the depth that clippers have.
bpoleschuk::Saw a clippers fan talking sh.it about the wolves being historically bad I had to say something. That is one of the dumbest things you can fu.cking say. The clippers are on their way for their THIRD SEASON above .500 in their history. THIRD. 3rd. ONE TWO THREE.
Dwyane Pay Me To Play Me Wade::hahahaahahahah @ Wolves fans  Is Kyrie soft now?! Huh?! ahahahahahaahahahahaha
bpoleschuk::I have never heard that but I do agree if someone did say that its was stupid, but I've still never heard a wolves fan say that.
halinahandbasket::by the way, without kevin love...this wasnt a game, so i can understand why there are 'only' 949 comments here
Ball-aholic::interesting perspective on the 80s Lakers vs. the Kobe Laker generation  http://feastnfamine.wordpress.com/2012/04/12/the-los-angeles-lakers-a-generation-lost/
itsaboutteam::There should be a 'DNP= HE SUCKS' category for not playing and Darko should get it every game
Cadolots::I was there when Blake miss that dunk lol, THE FANS LITERALLY ROFL when he missed it was priceless
ustna::Really? LITERALLY??!? I didnt see ANYONE rolling on the floor laughing.....
1Realthing::Apparently you missed english class too...
FREEcity8701::before clippers fans try to act like LA is turning into a clippers town... just realize that i am posting the 938th comment on this board in the midst of a gut-wrenching playoff race for the clippers.  meanwhile, EVERY lakers game against even the sorriest teams somehow ALWAYS gets "5000+" in that little conversation box.  not trolling. just stating it like it is. the clippers are definitely on the rise, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
aussie24villan::Those ESPN conversation box numbers will be pivotal in the playoffs though hey?
1Realthing::You are trolling. You are a laker "fan" on a Clipper conversation feed.
kezmicdust::No Clipper fan is claiming that. Laker fans are the definition of bandwagon fans, so it's no wonder LA is crawling with them. We'll be happy to win the Championship and Laker fans can be happy that they live in "Lakertown".
bluesince62::Laker fans... bandwagon?  This from a Clippers fan?  Championship?  Try winning the third playoff series in the franchises 40+ year history FIRST.  BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Pure comedy gold.  Here. Read this. And pay attention.  Clippers Playoff Appearances: 7 Championships  0  Lakers  Playoff Appearances: 58  Championships: 16
laxfiles::I hope there isnt a lakers/clippers playoff series... i wouldnt be able to work, just troll all day
halinahandbasket::doesnt look that way...if the lakers hold serve at the 3 seed, memphis would wipe the floor with LAC
Joe Raygor::I'd love a Lakers vs. Clippers playoff series too. That would be epic.
FREEcity8701::but besides the point, i can't WAIT to see a possible lakers vs. clippers showdown. gonna be some insane theater.
99chris1997::give the clippers an athletic wing like iggy or something gees this team would be incredible
halinahandbasket::o $@%!, give any team an athletic wing and I bet that their team would be incredible too
NBA_refs_are_weak::caron butler?
Joe Raygor::So, what is our "Magic Number" at now?
snow_brdr_88::There's a new team here in LA! Move aside Lakers, ur the next Celtics
REDUCE523::LOL lakers fans hating the clippers are the other LA team now. Cant happen ask the dodgers about the angels LOL
bluesince62::Angels aren't in LA.  And please, Clippers?    Try winning a second playoff series in franchise history first before actually claiming anything about anything, mmmm'kay
scante31::There's 3 teams in L.A. now? Hopefully the new one will at least be better than the Clippers. What a sports tragedy that franchise is.

thao67::This tells me that without Rubio, the T-Wolves are nothing.  They are going have to offer Rubio the maximum deal once his contract is up.
halinahandbasket::that's fck ing ridiculous...would you keep rubio over love?
