RyanCarranza::Philly is a really good team, but they don't have a D Rose on their team.  Simple as that.  Good game.
heartmeetsground::As expected, that was a great game. A lot of respect for Coach Collins. On to the next. Go Bulls!
chuckyg2::A top defensive team in the league double teamed D. Rose with it's best two defensive players, results: 35 pts., 8 assists, 31st win. Exact same situation as Lebron in Utah, the difference, Rose takes the shot to win the game. No pass to Taj or Boozer.
chuckyg2::He was double teamed at various points in the game. For anyone who actually watch the game there is nothing misleading about that statement. Unless you over analyze it.
Yo11Centerfield9::Well, that first sentence is misleading, due to the fact that they didn't double him until the end of the game.
chadhenne07::bulls just beat the spurs and philly both respect playoff contenders.......if bulls lose to pacers tonight...people will say bulls cant beat an above .500 team.......so go ahead and wait for the one we lose
phxpilot3::D Rose will be taking his talents to south beach to win titles with the league minimum   thoughts?  (il be back soon the drive thru im working is busy)  -heatster
GeX.1::you forget the:  .
ESPNMod189::"Not all bandwagoners are Heat fans, but all Heat fans are bandwagoners." -ESPNMod074
phxpilot3::refs 96 76ers 92  thoughts?
GeX.1::the refs gave philly so many breaks i was ready to throw my shoe at the TV.    i couldn't believe how many no-calls and BS fouls they called on chicago.
DJnamaste77::neither. Since the score was Bulls 96 76ers 91
phxpilot3::LOL hilarious that i say douch*e and heatster is correctly entered into the blank
GeX.1::oh ha. Heatster ;D
phxpilot3::haha im a bulls fan just felt like quoting that douch*e
DJnamaste77::"Noah placed his hand on Thibs shoulder to make a point."   ESPN, you need better journalists.... because that is just lame
DJnamaste77::yes. We pay attention to the little details, and leave out the important stuff!
SedinSistersHaveFakeBeards::They do observe well :) Maybe that was the point they were trying to make. "Here at ESPN, we pay attention"
Heat Dynasty 2010-2020::My respect for the 76ers is down the drain after this game, how could you lose to the Bulls at home?
Rick-Da-Villain::The same as they lost to the heat at home
DungHungLo::Heat couldn't beat the Lakers!
DJnamaste77::Loses happen. Your precious Heat lost back to back games. one to Utah..... What's your point? should we lose respect for the Heat??? Oh wait they never had respect from anyone except band wagoners. My apologies to the fans of the Heat who liked them before Lebron came along.
GeX.1::u mad?
crabbymacintosh::The fact that Evan Turner didnt shoot a free throw in this game is a travesty.  I have never seen a player in my lifetime who gets less love from the officials.  He got absolutely crushed going to the basket a few times and they give him nothing.
grapenutz78::Iggy is terrible!!!! Not an all-star
Jganon93::luol deng was scoreless when iggy guarded him then in the 4th he had to guard rose cuz he was lighten it up, iggy cant guard two players at once
crabbymacintosh::Still an all-star.  Guess no one here watched the game.
aaron-rodgers-ballbag::your right, iggy is not really that good, he is on the lower level of 2nd tier stars....
crabbymacintosh::youre dumb.  He held luol deng scoreless until the 4th quarter and to 8 points in the game.
aaron-rodgers-ballbag::none of this matters, the bulls can't beat the heat over 7 games, the bulls need another scorer, d-rose is a beast, but lebron will-can shut him down again, good regular season bulls. lol
ESPNMod189::Bandwagon much? Packers, Heat.... what else, Yankees? Bruins?
DJnamaste77::Doesn't look like the Heat can beat the Lakers in 7 either......
SedinSistersHaveFakeBeards::Or the Bucks. :)
allroy1313::Can the Sixers please just bury Jodie Meeks on the bench for a few weeks?  He's been brutal.
Fat Kid And Druggy Daddy::D.rose for MVP twice. he may have been out a little because of injury but he's a great point guard and very explosive.
AbyssinianLion::Over Rated Heat go 3-4 in the next 7 games:  Tue, Mar 6	New Jersey ----- WIN Wed, Mar 7    Atlanta ------------Loss Sat, Mar 10	Indiana------------WIN Tue, Mar 13 @Orlando----------Loss Wed, Mar 14@Chicago---------Loss Fri, Mar 16    @Philadelphia---Loss Sun, Mar 18	Orlando------------WIN	  Thoughts?
DungHungLo::I can remember Chris Bosh crying like a baby after the loss to Dallas!
aaron-rodgers-ballbag::really, i see 6-1 maybe 7-0. it might be time for bulls fan to get realistic...
stokez5802::I think the pacers gonna crush em to.
Jaguarcrazyboy::Great game last night. Aside from all the stupid calls.. It was a very good game.GO BULLS!
Danny74068::Great game and great effort by the Sixers.  They played great and are a team to watch out especially during playoffs.  I'm glad the bulls won this one, but to all sixers fans, it was a great effort.  Go Bulls!!!!
mmostello::Wow, so this is what losing to a better team that actually plays better looks like. It was nice to see the Sixers actually lose as opposed to getting hosed by the refs.
crabbymacintosh::agreed.  There were missed calls both ways.  Though the Sixers blew plenty of opportunities to win this one.
Chicagocold312::Man where's the trolls at before i even get started?
LosBulls15::cj and d rose need to play more on the floor together
marting260::WOOO GO BULLS..THEY KEEP WINING...FUNK THAT BOY IS GOOD..DROSE
Rossi46Doctor::So the Heat haven't won anything yet. They won't win a ring til LBJ is gone. Sorry heat fans.
mikerod25::d-wade is getting sick of carrying lebum
mikerod25::lebum cant handle the big stage
mikerod25::the heat will be bounced out of the playoffs in the 2nd rd
stokez5802::By the hawks!!!hahaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gogogoberrymix6::The Bulls are currently 29th in SOS
Dissention83::Bulls didn't make their schedule, nor did they make most other teams suck. It's just the state of the NBA.
MrMacross::While that's true, they've had the busiest schedule (39 games played, one more tomorrow), and the most road games (23, with one more tomorrow).
chicagofan68::and one game into a 4 games in 5 days stretch. but dont use logic, this joke ignores logic like the plague.
Rossi46Doctor::The Heat are currently on a 2-game losing streak, and currently making excuses for it. LOL
chicagofan68::that is highly, highly doubtful.
Gogogoberrymix6::how is that relevant to my post? I'm a Suns fan LOL
Party at Sanduskys or Bernies which is more fun::Heat will beat the Bulls when it counts....IN THE PLAYOFFS
stokez5802::You won't make it to the ECF!The hawks will destroy you.P.S If you think the heat has a chance in hell with the bulls after barely beating us the first time WITHOUT DENG,or WATSON,You should SEEK COUNSELING!You're in for a rude awakening!
Sean88142::We'll all be saying "If only Miami didn't lose in the semi-finals" after you jinxed them.
Mr Calogero::Bulls &gt; J-SMOOVE2029
Derrick Rose is a beast::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSzdtCkUzaY

I just love rose this dude is great  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Tcx3LMRN9k&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C3e60...67fUDOEgsToPDskLxFAPiQFAIOItJ--mGlis4

D-ROC-BULLSFAN4LIFE::Bulls are overrated????? Shove it J-Smoove
Windy City Assassin::Weak...
Jamie5731::Thibs need to play Rose and Watson together more, since they go trap Rose bringing the ball up court just have Watson do it
Bede Bears::Agreed x100!!!!

Crawford2CurryAND1::Iverson &gt;&gt;&gt; Rose
fightinillini32::STUPID.
Madhouse_United::Rose has yet to hit his prime.........
--.Bullster.--::good to see Rip hit some shots. he just needs more minutes now, especially in the 4th quarter with the trap. still want to see the bulls cut down on the turnovers
