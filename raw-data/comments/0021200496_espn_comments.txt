Lt. Frag::Slamspunkonyou is such a "Tool," he has "CRAFTSMAN" tattooed on his @$$!
mkwan0::listen, games do not mean much right now.  The wins are nice because they improve the chances of HCA.  Lakers are a non-entity, Clips and Grizz will likely be only marginally relevant.  Any fan, or troll, who thinks that the Spurs mediocre record against the top teams right now means anything hasn't watched a lot of basketball.  What is important right now 1. Staying healthy 2. conserving energy 3. developing chemistry\spacing\timing\trust 4. stockpiling wins for HCA  statement games against other teams are NOT important right now.
SPURZWARZ1.0::Slamspunkonyou is so stupid, he thinks You Tube, is an online gay dating website!
DalvinSplit::Nice win by my Spurs ,That is NBA ......long season .Yes happend we lose game here and there but most important is that we stay on wining course .Spurs are like 27 W and 9 L = 75% wining games....that is just awesome. With Splitter in starting line up we are better and better each game.As allways HEALTH is most important for any team  specially for my Spurs. I still belive OKC is team to beat in the West ,but should be very close fight  to the end . Will see.
mkwan0::It will come down to OKC and the Spurs.  Whoever is healthiest and freshest will win.  This is where the Spurs depth versus the Thunder's youth will be a huge question.  Historically, youth is favored over depth, but we will see.
ThunderLoseAgain::In Texas, we have a word for slamdunkonyou!  HOTO!
4-Petes-Sake::Slamdunkonyou is a closet homosexual like I am! He is my lover inspite of his little wiener!
Grape Nutz::Are you cheating on me with slamdunkonyou ? You Tramp!
ENDZZONEZ::Lol, I knew it, these 3 are queer than  $2 bill!
The Pragmaticist::I'm almost amused by how effectively slam dunk trolls spurs boards, but it's getting boring and it clutters up the boards. I'm mainly a reader these days, so I guess this is easy for me to say, but can't y'all just stop feeding this troll? I mean, here's a guy who has made wrong predictions within the last week, but claims he's always right, Why would someone do that, do you think? Hint: it's not because he doesn't realize it. You probably won't hear from me again, because if he's as true a troll as I suspect, he'll get me banned. The one thing a troll can never tolerate is someone calling him at his actual game. But get a clue.
Grape Nutz::Don't talk about my lover that way!
ThunderLoseAgain::He is gay, what do you expect!
Spurs7840::He's like a tool in a toolbag that's even others tools don't like.
atoyotagaspedal::$@%!$@% this, how new are you guys to the internet to respond to a !$@%!$ troll?
mksatx::Can't wait till spurs kick fakers butt.  We all know u will be on clippers blog with your tired old stupid crap.   Anyways you make me laugh your so freakin predictable and juvenile.
mksatx::Lakers got nash back. Gasol is playing. So what's year excuse now?  U are definately stupid.  You said the bucks would beat the spurs.  After  that u picked spur over knick.  On and on.  What are u 13?
4-Petes-Sake::You can "Pick" me anytime LOVER! ^^^^
slam_dunk_on_u::I did pick the shamz over the sixers...and as always I was right on the money!
Grape Nutz::Was the blow job I gave you a "sham?"
slam_dunk_on_u::never picked the spurts over the Knicks to the contrary I said that would be a slaugther...and it ended up being just that....the Knicks stomped the poor shamz!
Grape Nutz::^^^^I want to "spurtz" in your mouth, it's big enough!
4-Petes-Sake::You weren't complaining about "Spurtz" in bed last night! Did you get the stain out of your underwear?
slam_dunk_on_u::You just said it numbnuts! Nash Just came back...and Howard has a bad back still healing from surgery, the Lakers problem right now is CHEMISTRY...they haven't gel just yet...Once they do that...WATCHOUT NBA!!!!!
Grape Nutz::I thought I was your "Numb nuts," Lover! ^^^^^
4-Petes-Sake::Are you coming over tonight to bend me over^^^!
slam_dunk_on_u::Get ready for the first visit of the LAKESHOW to your filthy city....  This Wednesday the LAKERS will humiliate the shamz on your home court.  This will be the only sell out game of the season since every time the big boy Lakers come to your little town, the AT&amp;T Center explodes...  Lakers 126 Shamz  91
4-Petes-Sake::Slamdunkonyou, why don't you call me anymore? It's not your fault you couldn't get it up! I still love you, inspite of the fact you won't admit you are gay!
Spurs7840::I'm sorry, what about the Lakers beings the Clippers b.itch?
Tiagoooo::Lmfao! delusional
slam_dunk_on_u::Kobe with 56 points, Howard 36, Nash 18, Gasol 16
4-Petes-Sake::And you also scored on me last night!^^^
Racketyplum::care to put a wager on it?
slam_dunk_on_u::Racketyplum - you know your not gonna be on this board after the game, just like you were nowhere to be found after the first game in LA, sounds like your the coward dude.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Win or Lose I will be here ....But you know that will be a Laker WIN!
Racketyplum::you know your not gonna be on this board after the game, just like you were nowhere to be found after the first game in LA, sounds like your the coward dude.
slam_dunk_on_u::You wouldn't pay
mksatx::Question? Why doesn't  los angeles float away into the ocean?  Because california sucks too.
Spurs7840::The ocean doesn't want California.
mksatx::Almost as much as slam punk
slam_dunk_on_u::The spurts new moniker will be :  SHAMZ  So from now on I will refer to the spurts as "SHAMZ"  How 'bout them SHAMZ!!!
Grape Nutz::slamspunkonyou is ho mo sexual of the year!^^^^^
4-Petes-Sake::Is our relationship a "Sham?" That's not what you said last night as you were bending over!
Racketyplum::whatever makes you fell better i guess, i know my baby sister used to use those exact same tactics.
mksatx::Anybody know who the lakers lost to last night?  And who the will get beat by next?  Answer.  The rest of the nba
mksatx::The spurs are tied with one other team in the nba for most wins so far.  Yep I'm happy with what they have done so far this season.  Good job spurs.  Beat new orleans next.
slam_dunk_on_u::Nobody gives a rats a$$ about the spurts but you....idiot!
Grape Nutz::I was in your @$$ last night &amp; your! didn't complain
4-Petes-Sake::I give a rats @$$ about slamdunkonyou! He can "deep throat" a fire hydrant!
Racketyplum::Tim Duncans in his 16th season is still a better player than Howard.
Racketyplum::hows being a Laker fan working out for you?
slam_dunk_on_u::Pathetic spurt fans should stop dreaming about trades...the stingy spurt front office will not make any trades...so too bad for you ....  The spurts can not afford any players because your team doesn't have any tradeable assets...NOBODY wants your worthless scrubs...  You will not get Cousins or any other players....
4-Petes-Sake::I'll trade my @$$ for your mouth, Lover!
mksatx::Bonner can hack whoever off the bench and hit threes.  I don't think demarc cousins is a trade the spurs can make.  Spurs don't have guys that they could afford to give up for one player in return
mksatx::tiago another double double.  Timmy had 12 pts early.  They both start.  Don't need blair either way.  Long as diaw is available .  Spurs points in the paint are set.  Tim hits his top of the key jumpers. Etc etc.
Ameero80::Spurs fans, what about a trade for DeMarcus Cousins to shore up what has alienated us since the 2007 finals, a legitimate center to allieviate Duncan come playoff time?
whoseyourdaddy60::Pop wouldnt allow a trade for a head case like that. nice try.
No-account drifter::Even if it could actually happen, and even if the Spurs could get him for leftovers (Blair, Bonner, and Mills?), he doesn't strike me as a workable prospect. Nutty as Jackson and Rodman are, they have heart, work ethic, and will to win as a team. Spurs can work with that. Cousins just seems like a baby diva. I don't think even Pop and Duncan can cure what ails Cousins. And that's quite an indictment.
mksatx::Hey nba in general.  Is there a rumor about cousins being traded.?    He won't be traded till after he finishes this contract yr.  Ok  stop w the d c nonsense people
TexasBoi98::depends on who is traded for him i guess. i havent seen much of cousins play, but an athletic big that can defend pick and rolls and protect them rim is a key piece that i think the spurs are missing. if cousins can provide that, then sure.
LL_Cool_Chris_aka_TruSpurz::Slamdunk you keep this up your going to end up like that old bitter sun's fan that post the same ish every game
slam_dunk_on_u::The "Juggernaut" spurts are a combined 2-6 against the top teams in the NBA.    This is why the term "OVERRATED" applies to them:    Looky looky:     Thunder 1-1   Grizzlies 1-0   Clippers 0-2   Knicks 0-2   Heat 0-1
Grape Nutz::Hey lover, your are both a "juggernaut &amp; choker," in bed!^^^
ENDZZONEZ::Speaking of "choking," I see you have a boyfriend!
TexasBoi98::13 years of 50+ win seasons = juggernaut. besides, they purposely sat 4 players (in addition to both SF being out to injury) against the Heat and only lost by 3.
slam_dunk_on_u::The spurts are a bonifide choker not a juggernaut ....
Marc1347::And yet the spurs have won more titles than all these 4 teams combined
Racketyplum::Who cares? Spurs pretty much sleep walk into the playoffs every year. Lakers are lucky to grab the 8th seed
Racketyplum::point is as a fan i can only look to the future, and the Spurs' looks a hell of alot brighter than that sorry team you root for.
Racketyplum::and Lakers?
slam_dunk_on_u::Racketyplum - every year? How can that be possible when this team has won 3 titles in the passed ten years? Nothing to be sorry about  --------------------------------------------------------  Not since 2007 buddy
Racketyplum::and this is all irrelevant, your trash talking the spurs when the team you root for, the Lakers, wouldnt even be the 8th seed if the playoffs start today. Really makes me think what goes on in your head.
Racketyplum::every year? How can that be possible when this team has won  3 titles in the passed ten years? Nothing to be sorry about
slam_dunk_on_u::they sleepwalk in the regular seaosn only to choke in the playoffs it happens every year....and the trend will continue ...sorry! LOL
HOUSTON12372::hows your team doing
slam_dunk_on_u::suck a$$ spurts
Spurs7840::Hi, my name is slam_dunk_on_u when I'm not making 8th grader jokes on ESPN, I like to pretend I know what I'm talking about and when that doesn't make me feel better I take corny pictures of myself so others can see.
cggw::Can't wait to put money on whoever is playing this Spurs team in the first round.
mksatx::Hell just show me the money.  How much does yer mom have in her purse anyway?
sport medic::When you say that after a 23 point Spurs win you come across as a know-nothing troll.
cggw::Will double down when Manu eventually goes down on schedule
sport medic::Speaking of going down on schedule.....  Stockton.  You make this too easy.
No-account drifter::You do that. Bet the mortgage.
SPEN206209::Looking at the box score---glad that Spurs G Gary Neal had a good game after missing several games with an injury. Hedging that he will be with the team going into the playoffs--but he may be part of the package trade that seems to be iminent with getting rid of DeJuan Blair, who is basically an afterthought in this 2012-13 season. But it could be Blair+Matt Bonner in a deal, if Boris Diaw steps up and will be an agressive player on offense= shoot more.
mksatx::I don't have a clue what pop might do far as trade but I do feel it is now or never if spurs can get real talent that is playoff talent.  Cause that's what other wcf teams will be thinking too
TomShoe02::Further proof that the Knicks game was irrelevant.  THIS is what the Spurs do whey they're rested.
timetodienow1234567::I can't believe that Griffin will start over Duncan. At least Duncan is a lock for the coach's pick.
TomShoe02::Remember, it's a fan vote. I'm sure all the 10-year old kiddies who only see dunks and not basketball probably stuffed Blake's box.  I'm not even sure if Timmy even wants the All-Star nod. He could use the rest.
SPEN206209::No matter how the season ends for the Spurs (stll hoping for the 5th trophy) Tim has so far put in an amazing season. (If the rest of the roster puts in the effort he has given, Championship  No. 5 is not out of the possibility.)  Go Spurs Go!!!!!
Complaint Dept.::Lol, according to that article Howard say the Lakers " have no chemistry!" I disagree they all stink up the floor, if that aint "chemistry" I don't know what is!

Complaint Dept.::And how is Kobe doing now?
Daryl in San Antonio::Patty!
Complaint Dept.::In between the legs! Manu is slick!
LL_Cool_Chris_aka_TruSpurz::Who shoots the ball more in the last 3 min Neal or Patty?
zhengshuo::13+ man
picaac15::There's no one on the Sixers that actually DRIVES THE LANE...    Even with Bynum that wont change- we need a real SG that can take over a game at any point.
lalatorre87::sorry james harden is taken
picaac15::Spencer Hawes has 22 points and is still the worst center in the NBA despite the stats
FrankPisFACTio211::GG, Sixer fans.
Complaint Dept.::"I want more playing time!"  Blair
