Joe_Hurst::Arguably, LBJ's worst game of the year.  Maybe the Griz have the recipe to slow him down?
TnT0711::Finals Preview?
nigel.inagan::Go miami heat!!
Jack39462::Miami is going to go back 2 back
Ravens fan since 2013::So what's the over in Vegas for heats streak?
Shaka Flaka Flame You Chodes::the heat are good but their fans are fuc.king tools
cafisher159::Seems like this was the Anti-Lebron. Clueless in the 1st 3 quarters then a bloodhound in the 4th...
dickiedave5.0::The Heat just keep winning. Meanwhile the haters haven't had any fun for 13 games now...
Pearle_2011::Obama sucks!!!
sportsInput2::Bored?
Pearle_2011::76ers with bynum &gt; current heat team
micheal3600::Pearle you are an idiot
Jessev1823::I feel sorry for this guy. Dreaming
alexanderipa1020::same sixers team thats getting spanked by the magic and bulls? yeah they are real good
22TampabayBucs20::whos got it better then the heat NOOOOOBODY!!!!
jimmyclams::Shaq played with a bunch of nobodies at LSU, no NCAA championship to speak of...
22TampabayBucs20::wtf does shaq have to do with any of this??
31sdfd::If Shaq were still in his prime. A team of a bunch of srubs and shaq could beat the heat
dickiedave5.0::That makes no sense whatsoever.
Pearle_2011::Andrea Igoudala &gt; Lebron
dickiedave5.0::re.ta.rd &gt; you
CTYHNTR::Are we going to be spammed with headlines every time this team extends its weak streak against weakened and crappy teams?  When the Spurs went on their 17+ game streak I don't remember hearing a single peep from ESPN or anybody else.
Z Wade::This kid is a moron. The only wins that count are ones against title contenders, apparently. The Heat's 13 game winning streak is "weak" because they don't play OKC or SA every single game. Meanwhile, no other team is anywhere near a win steak such as this, yet it's so easy!
22TampabayBucs20::holy crap yea u clearly don't watch basketball stop looking at records and actually watch the teams.
22TampabayBucs20::it must suck to have to go on the internet to get some kind of attention.if your team sucks then u shouldn't be talking trash about a team that doesn't.
CTYHNTR::Actually im talking about a team that doesnt suck getting less attention than another team who hasnt even accomplished as much.  Thats my problem.
hioh631::A winning streak is a winning streak. It doesn't matter who you play. Straw man argument at its finest.
UnderdogswillriseEventually::Clippers. Rockets. Thunder. Grizzlies. Hawks. Bulls. I thought those teams were pretty good.
micheal3600::CTYHNTR - None of those teams besides OKC and Clippers if they are lucky will be in the conference finals don't even pretend to believe that they will.  Well only four teams make the conference finals so according to you everyone else suck that makes perfect sense. what an idiot
CTYHNTR::None of those teams besides OKC and Clippers if they are lucky will be in the conference finals don't even pretend to believe that they will.
22TampabayBucs20::why are bulls fans talking trash?? u have no room to talk trash.the heat are on a win streak get the f over it.
CTYHNTR::Hey the Bulls suck, no problem admitting it, now go ahead and admit your streak is weak.
Z Wade::Memphis was on an 8-game winning streak. In their streak, they've beaten teams such as LAL, LAC, OKC, Chicago, Atlanta, and Memphis. The Spurs streak was a home streak, not an overall winning streak.  Do you even watch basketball or are you just stupid?
dickiedave5.0::If a 13 game win streak is so easy against these "weak" teams then why aren't more teams doing it? I'll be waiting for an answer.
CTYHNTR::The only quality win Memphis had was against GS and that was the first game of their streak.  The only quality wins of the Heats streak are the Clips, OKC, and (maybe but probably not really) Memphis.  Say what you want, the point is being spammed over this weak streak is annoying when the Spurs had a far more impressive one and nobody heard anything about it.
TheposterformerlyknownasDRC1981::Ho hum, yet another easy win for the greatest NBA dynasty of all time.    Led by MVP Champion Gold Medalist Greatest of All Time King James, the Heat really do not even have competition right now, and I'm worried the NBA ratings are going to suffer because of how dominant this team really is.  It will be at least 9 years before another team besides the Heat is seriously able to give this team any competition for the championship.       Bill Russell can brag about his 1960s Celtics, but the simple fact is that the current MIami Heat would destroy any of those teams by 35 points.     Greatest team of all time, period.
Pearle_2011::simple fact??? Please site your source, I would love to look that up

BIGGDOGG2425::Even on a bad shooting night for King James, he took over the 4th qtr by putting up 14 pts and scoring their last 8 pts.  So take that in your A$$, Skip Bayless and Y'all Haters!!!
Tom_Lipovski::He didnt move his hips enough mj wouldve danced better - Skip on lebron in heat harlem shake video
Pearle_2011::suck it brag
State Farm Agent Cliff Paul::Anybody see Chris? Cant find him

State Farm Agent Cliff Paul::Hey
oneandonlybabe::Fresh off banhood?
Jessev1823::State farm is expensive. No thanks lol
pipclooney6_realNBA_analyst::So I just checked the Spurs-Kings comments section. Ghost town with just under 960 comments.  The Spurs truly are boring af.
fins fan13::spurs suck and yes very boring the 80's call they want their bank shot  back duncan ha ha just kidding they are good but stop flopping ginoboli i cant spell
oblique15::Boring, did not stop them from winning titles
oneandonlybabe::Parker getting injured is a bad break for them
jordan was overrated::their uniforms are boring, their arena is boring, they don't really play boring but the face of the franchise is the most boring athlete of all time (tim duncan)  they really are a boring team in most aspects though. fundamental doesn't equate to exciting. womens' basketball is very fundamental but boring to watch 99.9% of the time
j-wk-g 7.0::may be more because of their opponent
j-wk-g 7.0::to an extent, but it may not be as much about how relevant the heat are as a team as it is about this team having the best player on the planet...
oneandonlybabe::But that's the point. Usually most relevant teams have the most trolls, bandwagons, etc. It goes hand in hand.
j-wk-g 7.0::^^this lol
oblique15::yeah, It`s not like people come to Heat boards cause they find the Heat fun to watch.  Most are trolls, Haters , bandwagon fans banking on a sure thing, or people laughing at the others going at it lol
j-wk-g 7.0::but the spurs are boring, not debating that
j-wk-g 7.0::take into account all the people who come to the heat boards to "troll" and what not, and those that try to fend them off by replying....add in that it was a double OT game and 5k+ makes sense
pipclooney6_realNBA_analyst::Heat v Kings comment section broke 5k comments easily. So no, that's not it.
j-wk-g 7.0::After being dubbed on the decline for the first few months of the season, D-Wade now ranks 5th in the NBA in PER, 1st among shooting guards, 1st in blocks among shooting guards, and is one of 4 top 10 scorers shooting 50%+
oneandonlybabe::People allow themselves to be prisoners of the moment. Just look at how many are overreacting to Lebron's somewhat off night....
j-wk-g 7.0::most definetly, and these days people usually only repeat what they hear popular analysts say
oneandonlybabe::And not just that but how quickly they are ready to judge a player based on one game or a series of games. Then again even the media does that...
j-wk-g 7.0::i guess it means that they have a very high standard for him
oneandonlybabe::I know that's how ridiculous the whole thing is.
j-wk-g 7.0::somewhat off, which can be considered a career night for many
Johnw1104::Overrated. Anyone can do that...  Right?
j-wk-g 7.0::haha exactly
LeBron James MVPX4::Laker fan club http://www.lightweightfunny.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/brick-squad.jpg
NoThanks2U_25::I read The HEAT sent the costumes back (except Mario he kept the Hat). Even rich people are cheap, the none stupid ones of course.
2705chase::Yeah thats why nearly 70% of the nba is broke after 5 years of retiring......
gt1master_ike::Not mutually exclusive but being cheap saves money. You never know how much you will need or when you will need it.
oneandonlybabe::Not being able to manage your money and being cheap are not mutually exclusive. Not that I would expect you to understand the concept though.
oneandonlybabe::correction rich people are usually more cheap
dickiedave5.0::That's why they're rich in the first place...
Runninandgunninbball::Bron had terrible 1st 3 quarters......then he brought it home..... Tough team and tough game, which they needed..... Heat all the way!!!!!!!!
Johnnyin54321::who cares lebron is the nba paper champion who there trying to push and not getting over he had to join stars to win meanwhile jordan and bird and magic as well as kobe brought the stars to there own teams istead of leaving wake up people
Rad_Shadow::Kobe brought what to LA? Last I saw he couldn't win without superstars and rode Shaq for 3 titles.
oneandonlybabe::I think a five year old would have been ashamed of that paragraph.  Kobe, Jordan, Magic would have left Cleveland a lot sooner than Lebron had they been in the same situation.
fins fan13::word andy who cares the heat are winning enough said
Andy McNugget::its very apparent that you have never been to Cleveland
fins fan13::the win is all that matters
fins fan13::giggidy giggidy giggidy goo
gt1master_ike::Wade has been balling and consistent lately. That is bad news for the rest of the league.
MudrunnerVA3::The revenge tour continues on Sunday.
rainmaker2007::Last night it was LeBron "Brick" James. Lol!!
MudrunnerVA3::Yet they stopped the second hottest team in the NBA right in their tracks.
Skynet33::Yet he almost had a triple dub. He did terrible.
bucksnreds::Taxes suck more than my Orlando Magic. FACT!.

HEAT_PLANE_NATION26.4::THE HEAT SHOULD ENTER THE NCAA TOURNAMENT AND DOMINATE ALL DAY BRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET LEBRON THAT NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
abrescj::Even if you have been a real Heat fan (before LeBron). You are making every other real Heat fan look ignorant.  I tried to say it the nicest possible way I could.

Skynet33::Hell yeah lets go Canes[]_[]
Skynet33::Why does everybody troll the heat board win or lose? When Okc or spurs lose the amount of hate and jealousy is nothing compare to the Heat.
MyFeetHurt305::Because people will always hate the best, it is called envy and jelousy
abrescj::LeBron's fault, I guess
HEAT_PLANE_NATION26.4::BECAUSE WE DUZ IT SO BIG AND THEY MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GaspoMinnyFan981::Lots of good college basketball games on this weekend

HEAT_PLANE_NATION26.4::IT DON'T MATTER ONE BIT THAT LEBRON LOST IN THE FINALS!!!!!!!!! ALL WE WILL REMEMBER IS HIM DOIN IT BIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  HEAT NATION STAND UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
abrescj::Dwyane Wade.    Arguably, the most selfless super star in the NBA (and the opposite of Kobe in that regard).    Even going back a few years to the day Riley signed Shaq. Wade proclaimed something along the lines of: "this is his team now".    How quickly some of us forget this future Hall of Famer's greatness..
FeFyeFoeRun::<b> Lets all take a moment of silence for the Pathetic Blue light Troll B.Worst who is GONE FOREVER!  LMFAO at that LOSER!  </b>
FeFyeFoeRun::Anyone Miss all his paranoid delusional BS?
