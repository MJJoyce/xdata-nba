Tony Anthony::This is pathetic. Can somebody hit a shot please?
Tony Anthony::John Wall is horrendous today.
Anton::Brick by brick John built a wall
A1RiC t(-_-)t::John BRICK Wall today...not a good game for him
Cate::Not a thing wrong with the Wizzards that a self assured coach couldn't cure...a coach that has the guts to tell an $80 mil player that he will sit if he takes a 3 point shot with 6 secs to go in a tie game
Tony Anthony::My goodness... STOP SHOOTING JUMPERS JOHN WALL!!!!
Rusty Shackleford::Wall sucks. He is too streaky and has no clutch gene. Wizards finally got to .500 and cant figure out how to win since. Coach needs to go.
PKM::Both these teams make the playoffs
dc::Al Horford!
Kevin::OVER 100 REBOUNDS IN THIS GAME....CRAZY
