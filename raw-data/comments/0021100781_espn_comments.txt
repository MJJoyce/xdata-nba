mwlevine::Granger has been playing his best ball of the season over the last few games. We need George, Hibbert, Collison, and Hill to step up. We just are not consistent top to bottom every night. If we had that consistency, we would be very tough to beat. Good win Pacers
college hill cincinnati::Good Win
bustasports1::whos first for steals and blocks for sf's? lebron? igoudala? nonono JAMES JOHSNON sooooo underrated http://thesirdunkalot.blogspot.ca/2012/03/most-underrated-player-in-nba-by-far.html
hoosierfan008::Danny Granger can take the Pacers far into the playoffs even to the championship, yes you heard me, the championship if he continues to play like this.
bengalsrgay43034::If Granger hibbert and George showed up every game the Pacers would be a damn good team. Unfortunately it seems like at least one of  those players have an off game every night
cutnshoot1985::Wow so many rocket haters...lol
cutnshoot1985::If rocket fans want to help, stop attending games.  That will force Alexander to finally touch his billfold.  If the organization gets money from tickets, les and morey are happy.  This is what's keeping us mediocre, those 2 fools coul care less for a championship
longhornbush::Considering they are an undermanned team that does more with less every year since Yao and T-Mac were lost... Completely agree. It is kind of silly
iownamicrowave::I thought bulls fans were bad, then i experienced Rocket fans tonight,
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i got along with bulls fans, don't hate on rose and you're good usually. respect the MVP, there is a reason he got it. knicks however. man they are bad
bengalsrgay43034::Bulls and Knicks fans are still worse lol
kaveman311::Indiana=Irrelevant state Pacers=Irrelevant NBA team
nblucas97::Indiana=8th largest city, Super Bowl, Indy 500, leader in national conferences, etc etc etc.
Woody and Buz::Really there's only 4 relevant teams. the spurs, thunder, heat, and bulls
BigHandsomeHoosier::You = hater.
Woody and Buz::Paul George is the next Kevin Durant
bengalsrgay43034::id like to see better ball handling and post moves. He is too goofy I think he is still getting used to his body.
BigHandsomeHoosier::He has a really high ceiling.  I remember Chad Ford or some scout saying that he would be the best player from the 2010 draft class in 2013 on draft night, so a lot of people saw his potential.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::dunking like a boss from all over the place haha
Woody and Buz::He does need to work on his jumper more but it would be nice if he drove to the hoop more often. against the spurs he did quite a lot and scored almost every time
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i agree with that, he improved tremendously in one offseason
NGplayinskillz::It really just depends on How much he improves his Jumpshot. If he improves as much as he did this offseason, this next offseason, then maybe just maybe he can become the Next Kevin Durant.
BigHandsomeHoosier::Maybe the next T-Mac.  Hopefully without the injuries....
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::hahaha we can only hope. more confidence is needed, but he will learn i think. he is going to be great!
BigHandsomeHoosier::Great win Pacers!  Only 1/2 game behind the Magic!
Ravens n Orioles::nvm
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::really is a solid win. needed a win no matter what to get back on track and catch the magic for 3rd, only a half game back now i think
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::they do play the bulls a lot better, but i'm also wanting pacers to avoid getting caught by knicks or sixers if one of those teams gets hot
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::maybe melo needed those two out of the picture (; but people said boston wasn't doing anything this year and now look. gotta be ready for unexpected!
NGplayinskillz::Pacers don't have to fear the 76ers and the Knicks are without Lin and Stat so they might not even make the playoffs.
Woody and Buz::id rather have them be a 4th or 5th seed so if they win the first round they meet up with the bulls. i think they have a lot better chance of winning against the bulls than the heat
Ravens n Orioles::yes. rose will have another d.ick injury.
Manimal 35::Go Nuggets
bengalsrgay43034::Way to go Pacers! Can't believe it was close tho. We should blow out teams that are crap like the rockets.
bengalsrgay43034::lol im just joking just in response to all the sore loser comments no need to cry. Couldn't watch the game I just watched the play by play on my phone. Seems like collision and George screwed up alot and Granger bailed us out
Btwixed::a road win against a team that was 20-7 at home is big. rockets are not "crap".
gotemcoach92::Wow, nobody told me the Pacers are title contenders this year. And nobody told me they were a dynasty that has room to talk down on other above .500 teams. Wait, have they ever won a championship? Don't worry I'll wait....
toxciti::gotemcoach92 - Wow, nobody told me the Pacers are title contenders this year. And nobody told me they were a dynasty that has room to talk down on other above .500 teams. Wait, have they ever won a championship? Don't worry I'll wait....  Good gmt box urn right  a win on your court is not easy  to come  by
gotemcoach92::Not to mention the starting backcourt is out for Houston
bdld55::I am a pacer fan, but fans like you make us look bad. Shut the hell up.
bdld55::Good job Houston. Never seen any team fight so hard. But Pacers got it tonight. With luck to the rockets moving on from this one. Pacers need to pick up Nash for a 2 year deal this offseason though!
bdld55::Yeah, I want him to win a championship too. He is one of the beat to ever play the game. I hear you. But if he did sign with the pacers,  we can't complain right? lol but I agree with you for the most part
leo9212::that's a dream man we can never get Nash. In honest opinion i want Nash to go somewhere and win a championship i have too much respect for that dude. nothing but a class guy
HTownRprsntr::Must be nice to play in a division with Milwaukee, Detroit and Cleveland HA!
NGplayinskillz::This Year with the Shortened Season and All, Divisions hardly even Matter. The Indiana Pacers have only played Milwaukee ONCE,  and they have only played the Rest of the Conference Twice.
PATRIOTSARELYKOMGGOOD::The Rockets lost to the team that plays in the same division as Milwaukee, Detroit, and Cleveland...
Ravens n Orioles::dont forget bulls d-bag
Btwixed::cleveland is not "around .500" haha
Ravens n Orioles::milwaukee and cleveland are right around .500
HTownRprsntr::Oh yah...the one good team, my bad.
Rexanilatorz::I really hope Fesenko gets some action soon I wanna see how he does as the backup center
Woody and Buz::Imagine how good the pacers could have been if we were able to work out a trade for rajon rondo in the offseason
Woody and Buz::yeah i think in 2 years time paul george will be averaging 23 plus points a game which would make danny not missed. right now he's shown flashes of it but it's like sometimes he doesn't want to shoot or gets in foul trouble early on or vogel just subs in early and leaves him on the bench for a while. hopefully he keeps working on his game
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::if those were the two players pacers lost i wouldn't have been too sad. but ya now rondo's price is probably even higher
Woody and Buz::probably collison and granger.... or collison some picks and someone on the bench.. they celtics now will want a lot more for him after this season and how he's performed though
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i'm still debating if that would've worked or not. what would the pacers have given up for him?
Sour_BACK27::Pacers should have lost. Deada.ss
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::and they didn't
Woody and Buz::Trade collison two future 1st round picks and maybe george hill for rajon rondo
redbloof1234::Pacers fan's sicken me sometimes. Collison is the main reason the Pacers turned around last year... Stop hating on someone who is dedicated to making the team better
leo9212::redbloof do you even watch pacers games dude. I agree that collision was good last year but look at this year every time he just makes bad decisions. He has great speed but shoots jump shots most of the time. He needs to use that speed and pass the ball to open teammate often.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i ask myself that same question when he gets irritated with me haha
masterjoe712::Pacers are 30th in assist, he hardly makes assists that are not jump shots. There are better point guards out there
gotemcoach92::Good game Pacers. As far as the Pacer fans that think they're great now....We have 3 first round draft picks and a very young team that has a bright future, this game isn't all that much. It's all about 2-3 years from now
rocketsin05::If anyone needs any more evidence this league is rigged look no more far than this game. Dragic got hacked, Parsens got got hacked and Lee got called for a trasvel while getting hacked. What a joke the NBA has become.
qandrews94::Did you forget about the obvious Parsons flop?
masterjoe712::The league just hates the rockets your right
Ravens n Orioles::waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
cutnshoot1985::Need to suck on a bottle?
leo9212::pacers need a pure point guard who passes
Rexanilatorz::If we could convince Steve Nash to sign he could make this team really amazing
Rexanilatorz::JERMEY LIN!! haha
atworth1::Collison is by far the biggest problem the Pacers have.  We gotta lotta work to do at the PG position.
bdld55::See, now that is a fair statement
bdld55::I am not a fan of DC but he is a pacer, so support him as a Pacer Fan or shut up about it.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i support him, but when he leaves i won't be sad one bit
redbloof1234::Are you guys fricken serious though? 50% shooting, clutch shots (not ft's ill give u that), 7 assists, and +5
masterjoe712::if it wasn't for him we could have won in regulation
redbloof1234::Explain
Rexanilatorz::The main problem with Collison is his decision making if he could somehow improve that it would help a lot in his game
redbloof1234::$@%!... If it wasnt for him we would have lost in regulation
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::he still needs to go
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::agreed
Mets2410::Dragic has been so good in a starting role. I shutter to think what the hype around him would have been like if he was in NY instead of Lin. Not saying Lin's bad, but Dragic has been better in my opinion.
HTownRprsntr::I can't help but laugh at Pacers fans talking trash....hey maybe you guys can get Reggie to come back.
enemy_80::Maybe you can come up with a better joke.
Ravens n Orioles::hey maybe you guys can get yao ming to come back.
NGplayinskillz::Maybe You can Get Yao Ming or Hakeem Olajuwon to come back.
iownamicrowave::Hey, your team is going nowhere.
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::i talked trash?
redbloof1234::Hey maybe you can win on your home court next time
HTownRprsntr::Wow good one, did you have help with this one?
longbeach49ersPacerfan31::yay
