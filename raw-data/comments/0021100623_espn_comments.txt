brady rodgers system qb HoF::"Dirk, Mavs right ship with win over Wizards" --  more like, get a freebie and avoid disaster
drama_king52::I agree.  The ship is still taking on water.  They just plugged a small hole amongst many.
netjunkie88::I think the last time a team shot 38 free throws against Dallas was in the '06 Finals when Wade had that many in Game 5.
World Champs t y Dirk::Not true.  Dont forget we played OKC.
World Champs t y Dirk::I will take the win but Damn dude.  tough times.  Lamar gotta go!!!  the fans still cheer him trying to bring him out of his funk and he's got no game at all.  I cant believe he beat out Terry last year for 6th man.  Not even on the same planet
