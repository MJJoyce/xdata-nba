mosesbyu::Free Jimmer.
Loof McDrut::Pleae explain to me with a winnable game did Coach Not-So-Smart give Fredette a DNP-Coach's Dumb A$$ Decision?
YeahTerps420::Love's a beast.  Which is kind of ironic o.O
laneclark13::All K-Love is is a stat monger. Let him make the playoffs before we anoint him
redevelopmentguy::Another gutless, horse s.hit performance by the Kings.
The-DHARMA-Initiative::I have Pekovic in fantasy and Love is KILLING ME!!!!!!!
brianisphil::Keith Smart might be the worst coach in the NBA.  Geoff Petrie might be the worst GM in the NBA.  Washington might be the only team that seems in more disarray then the Kings but at least they are letting their younger players get minutes.  What a joke this team is.
brettstubbs::Boy, it's a good thing Keith Smart decided not to play Jimmer AT ALL last night, I mean, he could have been disastrous, like Aaron Brooks (2-7) &amp; Cousins (9-22) were.
Loof McDrut::It is because Not-So-Smart is a dumb a$$
ibnfrey::Go Wolves! :)
treezeyforsheezey::Keith Smart is an idiot.
slo1111::Still shot the 3's like crude though.  When are those going to start falling in better?  Against a better team could have lost because of that.
the departed movie theatre scene::23 and 24. good stats but let's start winning games consistently K Love
gemsterq1967::Using a bet system named sportsbettingstar. Making around 2-3K a month profits using the system. You can find the system on google by searching for sports betting system. If you bet you gotta check this out.
Pusha Tonn::WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO :):):) go wolves!
JacobyJ4::So I know its a little late but can I get an explanation for why Jimmer isn't getting a shot at starting point???  He is shooting better than any other point guard... He has the 12th highest PER in the league...(only person in top 236 players playing less than ten min per game)... Thomas so far has been consistent scoring wise but he is turning the ball over as much as he is assisting and his points per minute arent as good as JImmers.... So that leaves only defense.... but he is not as bad as advertised.... Thomas is not much better than him and at times neither is brooks.... What we are doing now is not working... Why not give Fredette 30 min at the point and see what happens... Why do all the other points get a shot at it when Jimmer is outplaying the other two???
Loof McDrut::I hope that laneclark13 is wrong but I am beginng to wonder.  I can not think of any reason that Fredette should get so many DNPs.  Smart is an anu$.
laneclark13::He's white.  That is why he can't get a shot at playing.
78Bevan::At the very least, Jimmer should be the No. 2 guard.  Brooks is a safe bet at starter.  IT was a terrible choice at starter.  I am not sure what that was all about.  Jimmer as a starter might scare Smart.  What if after 5 games, Jimmer is only averaging 14 ppg?    That being said, Smart should be developing Evans and Jimmer.  Those two need to be pals, and they need to form a Jordan/Pippen relationship.    With the Kings, you have no 2 player combo that other teams fear.
bamberg1977::Should the Pistons send Monroe to tutor DCuz? You dont need 22 shots to score, just need to learn how to play the game! So happy Pistons got 'stuck' with Monroe
ChargersFan4Life001::i'm out also, gn all
abovethelies2::Goodnight to all...dreaming of the day when Rubio returns and Alexey and  he can be on the court together.....oh yeah!!!!
ChargersFan4Life001::gn
abovethelies2::Dude sorry for beating your Chargers up......oh yeah Phillips lol
SFNinersFan79::KLove is back baby!  MN peeps, bring me up to speed on the Rubio's status?
abovethelies2::Great!!!!!!  I like Luke but he gets a little OC and chokes with pressure....
SFNinersFan79::I like it!  I saw him on the sidelines at the Warriors / TWolves game on Sat., wasn't sure if he was coming back anytime soon.
grant1simons2::That's what the page says right now.
grant1simons2::Cleared for practice by the 29th
abovethelies2::Was that confirmed this evening???
abovethelies2::Next week I hear he should be back. He's in Colorado seeing Dr. Andrews for the ok
ChargersFan4Life001::abovethelies2How's your football team doing in SD this year?  Lol  la doesn't have a football team so......
abovethelies2::Maybe we can swap Norm as our OC and send you Musgrave.....Mus can give water to your QB (brain freeze on name)...lol
ChargersFan4Life001::anything is better than norv lol
abovethelies2::I mean way North.....Minnie....the Vikes coach is cool but not getting a lot of love up here.....we need to get rid of the offensive coordinator.... What OC would not run AP twice from the 8 yard line on 3rd and 2??? I have the answer.....OURS!!!!
ChargersFan4Life001::Norv is a solid OC but a horrible HC so he might help the wolves. AP is a beast
abovethelies2::He not the only owner that keeps hiring him.....let hope he never head north...lol
ChargersFan4Life001::I'd much rather him go there than stay in sd lol, but they got a good HC there so i think they are good.
abovethelies2::Now that's a coach/Turner that should be fired.....How's does he keep getting jobs..... I can't figure that out...
ChargersFan4Life001::dean spanos is an idiot, but he should be fired after this horrible season ends
abovethelies2::Could care less whether LA gets a team.....49ers all the way....Again.....what's up with your chargers fan4life?? Lol
ChargersFan4Life001::they suck
dogs-is-my-hero..::Brunick, you mad at me?
abovethelies2::Trash talking on Wolves vs Kings espn section 140 site...dogging Lakers fans....
abovethelies2::Now that's funny!!!
abovethelies2::Yes they are and I'm ok with that.... Do you think they'll eventually move the team to SD since the Clippers are killin? After all you don't have any good teams down there...
ChargersFan4Life001::clippers should move to seattle so i can keep hating the la lakers.
ChargersFan4Life001::Lakers are a sub .500 trash team
abovethelies2::Hey Laker Fans....You gotta protect your team... They are talking heavy trash about the Lakers on the T Wolves and Kings section 140 blog..... crazy stuff....Protect your team
SFNinersFan79::Yep, lived in Minnesota for 20 years, and through the KG era.  Now living in SF.
abovethelies2::SF.... very nice....although I like the weather near Santa Ana a little better...but take either  over winter..lol
SFNinersFan79::TWolves are a young talented team... you should be scared for many years to come!
abovethelies2::Yo dude am a T Wolves fan....and 49ers too...

ChargersFan4Life001::I say Smart

ChargersFan4Life001::so?
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::stop....taylor is a disgrace to the sport lol

FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::only in boston lol
brunick1::Come on you think he fell to the ground and was like hmm maybe I should fake an injury and then come back out really get the crowd fired up. Like who would think to do that?
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::get the crowd ancy for his return lol..
brunick1::Yeah cause Pierce faked an injury during the finals so what he could get a 5 mins rest? Whats the point?
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::it feels like ur arm has been ripped off..and you dont want to let ur shoulder dangle while u walk, a wheelchair obviously isnt necessary, but its smart, unlike paul pierce on the wheelchair lol
brunick1::Come on dude watch the whole footage of him climbing into the wheelchair. Hes acting like he got shot or something lol.
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::i take it u have never separated ur shoulder? its not fun lol
brunick1::LMAO he got the towel draped over him and everything has he gets wheeled off for a shoulder injury
United We Run::fins, are you good?

Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::lol i do too, but it's too distracting.
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::lata
avajamesyn::Both Minnesota basketball teams won tonight!
nlwhittle::At least we can't blame our poor defense on Jimmer this year.  Really...what do we have to lose by playing him?
nlwhittle::We are too young to be coached so poorly.  We won't make the playoffs with Smart.  Is it obvious that I hate that guy.  Run him out of sac town!
ChargersFan4Life001::nothing since it looks like the playoffs are not happening
United We Run::Fins, I am a combo of Rondo Kobe Durant Love Dwight So yeah, I am basically unguardable
nlwhittle::Foul him, he won't hit his free throws.  Chances are he drops forty on you, but chances are even better that he has 20 turn overs and you drop 50 on him as well.
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::lol....
Rajon-tripledouble-Rondo::lies
abovethelies2::Yep Kobe really sucks... especially with his five or six championship rings.....really sucks.....oh well
ChargersFan4Life001::he got those this year?
abovethelies2::How many championship rings does your team in SD have??? Oh yeah....you don't have a team...oh well
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::or six lol?
abovethelies2::Called sarcasm  or too many to count....lol
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::brunick,  find one of wade haha, i couldnt care less bout lebron, especially when he was on the cavs lol
United We Run::Fins, I could drop 50 on you
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::i thought kobe played well today lol, thats pretty much what i do in all my pickup games haha
brunick1::10 turnovers? Step your game up bro
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::i still drop like 40 haha..
nlwhittle::Are the Kings afraid to see if Jimmer is the real deal?  I didn't like him last year, but he has given us some good play off the bench in a very limited role.  Why can't we see what we have in him?  We get teased by our lottery pick for a couple of games and then he's back to dnp status.  Can't stand that style of coaching...Free jimmer!  Let him play for my Kings.
nlwhittle::I agree.  He has worked his butt off from what I hear.  And there is a huge difference in his play from this year to last.
nlwhittle::THIS...right back at ya!
ChargersFan4Life001::I'd probably say keep jimmer cause he has looked better
ChargersFan4Life001::smart and his horrible rotations. some games thomas gets a dnp and some games its jimmer. One of them should be traded and the other play as the 2nd pg
stein.soccer::im out, peace. GL non wolves fans! GG kings fans
United We Run::Later Stein, Skol Wolves
ChargersFan4Life001::gn GG GL to the wolves

brunick1::Celtics about to whoop the Nets at home tomorrow. D-Will was lucky Rondo wasn't playing last time.
stein.soccer::lol espn spends 3 seconds on Wolves-Kings
JeffreyBond13::RUBIO gets time on ESPN, not the WOLVES...  Just wait till Rubio is back...
ChargersFan4Life001::i thought it was 5 but yeah
United We Run::ESPN DGAF ABOUT MINNESOTA
brunick1::of course
United We Run::Boogie, more like Lolkers
Chapmanx23::There should be riots from the Kings fans becuase of Jimmer getting Zero playing time. Point blank he makes things happen and he can only get better handling wise and defense. He is a lights out shooter as you are all well aware..I just don't understnd Smarts thinking.
ChargersFan4Life001::smart is an idiot
United We Run::Finhead, why did you change you avatar
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::it is a dumb idea to put a pic of yourself as ur avatar lol..i learned that
FinsCanesHeat 1-3-6::trolls lol
