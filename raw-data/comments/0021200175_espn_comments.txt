winnumber101::Toronto is bout to start winning since Kyle Lowry came back.
kurliman73::we're the new clippers plain and simple.  pretty much a joke
malignant_m::Raps need to look beyond Lowry´s points, and give more minutes to Calderon.
bamberg1977::Stuckey was 2-9, how did he make those two shots? did Monroe dunk him w/the ball
verfielderbrera::Your gonna see Monroe get some triple doubles eventually. The more he plays the better he will get at passing. If The Pistons guards can shoot great in a few games you will see Monroe get 10 assists in a game for sure. He's just a smart player. It looks like they have a center now in Drummond. a True Center getting 8 Offensive Rebounds. That's huge for him. One more thing, Charlie V didn't play 1 minute this game. why have him at the end of the bench making millions when you can Amnesty him and have a young player like Middleton on the roster. That makes no sense. just get rid of the guy if he's not in you plans.
MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00::He already has 1 this season
Trespayne::And his contract is almost up and since they are not going to win the championship this year or next they might as well keep him for now, make some free agent signings (or one) when he's off the books and we get a ton of money to go with a great young roster and save the amnesty for down the road in case we need it.
bamberg1977::Because the fewer years you amnesty the less it counts towards cap
MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00::amnesty doesn't count towards the cap
pico2013::Bargiani is the best player in the NBA right now. Damn 65% shooting the ball hes hot and undoubtedly hes the best player in the NBA this season. Barginani 4 MVP
Cshekari4::lol. wow.. so ur picking a mvp that he cant play defence or rebound?
Prototype912::ehmm.....Bargnani
bamberg1977::Sure every other big goes off on him and he cant rebound, turns it over, but damn he scores occasionally with a .410 FG% overall. He's like the poorest mans D. Nowitzski
Mr. Bradford::Congrats on your double-doubles, Monroe and Drummond. That 57.7% at the line though... at least the Pistons faced the Raps. That terrible percentage won't hack it against teams worth a darn.
JrueRandallHoliday::WOW... DeRozan really earned his extension tonight, didn't he...
denn19641::This is win for us but still leaving that sickness of leading by double figure at some point and then giving the gme away. This is the first time Pistons win in a close game after leading in the third, well atleast its a progress.
toronto-vigilante3::Nets are 7-4.....  Colangelo, I'd be worried about your job this season.
toronto-vigilante3::Raps, the best 3 - 10 team the NBA has ever seen...
jfox82588::If the Pistons could get a decent to middle end SG the team would be a solid .500 team. They have a solid PG, C, SF Drummond could play PF.
JimDetroitFan95::I like the team....
luckeyes4u::thanks for asking.
Hoopster_4u2::super
All.Star54321::go vote for the best player in the NBA: http://isportslife.wordpress.com/2012/11/22/discussion-number-1-espn-player-rankings/
JimDetroitFan95::I like it.  Nice job Pistons.
.NYC IS THE BEST 68::Great game for both team that Bargs and knight played well down the strecth.
JimDetroitFan95::Nice job tonight Brandon.
JimDetroitFan95::Nice game from Prince
crruss5::"Pistons coach Lawrence Frank admitted Monday that the team plans to continue bringing Drummond along slowly, the Detroit News reports. "We are going to make this a slow process," Frank said. "Our plan is to build it up. It is a whole lot easier to build it up rather than throw it all out there and tear it down and give the kid's confidence away.""  I 100% agree with how the Pistons are handling Drummond.  And no, this isn't like Darko.  Darko got 2-3 minutes of playing time for his first couple of years.  Drummond is getting a solid 12-20 minutes + per game.
denn19641::Drummond deserves atleast 25 minutes.
Hoopster_4u2::smh, this isn't preparation for war, it's basketball.
MansGame5313::I was always on bring him in slowly idea like LA did with Andruw Bynum. However games like this gonna make it hard but i guess its best to stick with the plan
Hoopster_4u2::The Big 3 = Knight, Monroe and Drummond.
Beerd0135::you mean Monroe and the Monroettes?
Root Beer Thief::brandon knight should be averaging a quad double.
Hoopster_4u2::At least Toronto can look forward to the Grey Cup Sunday
Mad31nD3troit::Over/Under 9.5 wins for the Pistons?
JimDetroitFan95::That is easy.  Over.
JimDetroitFan95::If we can agree on a legit method, I will bet you 5k.  Interested?
JimDetroitFan95::Nice win Detroit.  Play defense and win some more.
Dioscuri0525::PISTONS SUCKS
niedlp::And so do you, $@%!$@%.
crruss5::I don't like how Maxiell is a starter.   Drummond should start.  Not to give him more playing time, because I agree you have to give him time to develop.  But because you want your 5 best defensive players on the floor to start the game.   PG - Knight SG - Singler SF - Prince PF - Monroe C  - Drummond  Maxiell and Stuckey coming off the bench as "energy" type players.
MansGame5313::Pipe dream pick up for the Pistons would be Rudy Gay. I think we would right in for the Pistons
PrinceofDetroit28::I think any scoring wing is what they need right now. It might have to wait until next year.
DetroitFanInATL313::drummond averaging 6 and 5 off the bench...imagine what he could do with starter minutes
denn19641::Aside from the win, seeing Drummond have a 13/13 in 24 minutes is more of a win to me. he just needs to improve his FT as it almost cost us the W.
SportsFan9835::trade stuck and start Andre
JimDetroitFan95::Do you understand contracts?  Who would take that on?
Mad31nD3troit::i thought the same with Ben Gordon...
PrinceofDetroit28::Nobody
MansGame5313::if we trade stuckey we would need to get somebody who could be instant offense. We don't have consistent bench scoring
RWTigersLionsGoBlue::stuckey has been instant offense in 1 or 2 games this season.  he has been awful.
PrinceofDetroit28::That doesn't matter that much. Just need to start developing the future.
NYGIANTSbigbootysmasher136::nba tv said Raptors won 90-89............
DetroitFanInATL313::get drummond more minutes
MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00::Pistons should still trade to get Shabazz Muhammad!
RWTigersLionsGoBlue::you mean the kid that is leading his team to terrible performances?
MansGame5313::MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00 - no, Maxey should be losing minutes.  I disagree completely he has been giving the hustle and grit we so desperately need right now if any big should be losing minutes its JJ not that he is terrible its just Max has been giving us a lot
J webb nation::Lmao Indy choking  This division is a joke without d rose
JimDetroitFan95::Nice job Brandon.
Hoopster_4u2::Those guys must have eaten some good turkey yesterday
pmully94::If the Raptors get a top 10 pick don't they keep it because it's protected?
wnsj89::i believe it's top 3 that is protected
pmully94::watch them get the 4th overall and OKC get to use it lol
J webb nation::Bhahaa look at all these tigers fans crawl out their holes..
niedlp::Look at you, being a $@%!$@.
MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00::awww umad??? Go cry!
JimDetroitFan95::I have been here the whole game man.
wnsj89::wooo!! nice job DET, I know it won't be easy but I really think the Raps can get a top 3 pick this year!!
DR HORSE::i see ,,, to bad the leafs didnt protect the pick with kessell
DR HORSE::its not there pick
wnsj89::it is if it's top 3!
pmully94::How the hell does a 7 footer play 38 minutes and only get 4 rebounds????
denn19641::He gets 34 points though.
MansGame5313::Bargnani plays small like Dirk used he needs a post game
mattcowboys77::his name is andrea bargnani thats why
JimDetroitFan95::Excellent game Detroit.  You stuck with it the whole game.
TheJTram::Frank...this kind of performance by Drummond deserves more minutes and possibly a starting role please...  Love -Pistons Fans
MansGame5313::I never really been on the start andre bandwagon but yeah he was great this game and stayed consistent with his hustle that does deserve a good look
zstevens2003::'Toronto sucks ... there was nothing we could do to overcome that fact !!!' - Refs getting paid to let Toronto win.
.Im Nick.::Man, the Pistons are better than 3-10, they just can't close out games,
lexx.yomen::Man, the Raptors are better than 3-10, they just can't close out games,
Philip3664::Also they gotta learn how to keep big leads when they get them
pmully94::Give Drummond more minutes! He's on my myTeam in 2k13!!!
Hoopster_4u2::Pistons need to trade Stuck.
J webb nation::Il give u rip back for him
J webb nation::Shoulda played jl3 more he's clutch
MansGame5313::This might be the game that puts me on the start Andre Drummond bandwagon he is mmmmmuuuuuccccchhhhhh better with Greg than with Jonas. Great game by those two. Also Tay being calm and clutch and BK coming through at the end
mattcowboys77::Now can Andre get some more minutes?!?
MansGame5313::Honestly I think the person that should be losing minutes is Jonas I like how he can spread the floor but he just been more of a liability this year
MEGA GIGABYTES SON 00::no, Maxey should be losing minutes.
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Two games in a row Toronto loses by one point to bad teams. I don't know what to think anymore :/
scottyfulton::True enough!
scottyfulton::They really have to be the hardest team in the league to cheer for.
JoeyDorsey4MVP::At least we aren't the Wizards :/
