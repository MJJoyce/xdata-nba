mwlevine::Memphis starting to come on following the slow start. Just get to playoffs healthy with Zbo back in the fold and they will be ready to make a run
andrewcubs1::it would suck to play on the hornets right now. Still most of the season left, and their record is aweful and have no fans at the game to support them.
Mets2410::grizzlies fans mayo is real solid that would suck if you guys dump him for basically nothing
andrewcubs1::for real. When he gets hot, the games over
56tricolor14::I wonder how long the line is to buy the hornets right now.
RCmemphis::Grit Grind Griz
andrewcubs1::Why isnt carl landry getting minutes for new orleans? I remember him scoring like 20 a game last year...
andrewcubs1::Grizz win 4th straight! My man OJ Mayo came up huge with his 3's
Jun360::True , O.J. save the day bro. Keep him !!!
Jun360::Good win GriZZ , my hats of to the Hornets for playin hard  Also Memphis will be stupid to trade O.J. Mayo , just sayinn....
Griss13ears::Anybody know why Sam Young isn't playing?
Griss13ears::Shame. I don't see any reason Josh Davis should get 14 minutes while Sam gets 0. Davis is a liability everywhere on the court. Play Sam. The boy can ball. When he's having a good game there is no stopping him. Saw that last year when Rudy was out and some this year when he has gotten minutes (Sacramento).
KeMvP277::the same reason aminu played 2 minutes tonight. nobody knows.
Lindian77::seriously $@%! the hornets im done with them
56tricolor14::I don't see then going anywhere anytime soon.
andrewcubs1::fair weather fan
KeMvP277::next year, just wait, we'll be fresh off of two high draft picks and we already have rising stars on this roster.
KeMvP277::Stop messing around with the lineup monty williams. Do Okafor, Landry, Ariza, bellinelli (gordon when hes back) and Jack. In case you didn't notice, that got us to 2-0 to start the year. Ever since you moved landry to the bench the team has won once. $@%!$@% idiot.
KeMvP277::We are not doomed for suck, we will have atleast one, probably two, lottery picks in this upcoming draft which will be stacked, because i highly doubt the twolves will make the playoffs, and nola will either have the 1st or 2nd or 3rd pick from this trashy season. And Gordon, aminu, vasquez, summers, ayon, and smith are all developing. Gordon will be a star if he can stay healthy, aminu will definitely be good, unless of course he plays 2 minutes a night like tonight. the rest i don't know about. But we have a great future b/c of the CP3 trade.
Lindian77::or even worse the new raptors
Lindian77::monty is a crap coach who got by because of cp3 and now i wouldnt put it pass the nba who owns this crap team to do nothing to fix them because we are a small market team doomed to suck for years we will be the new clippers
Lindian77::the timberwolves loss wasnt there fault though nothing you can do when kevin love is getting fouled every 10 seconds
KeMvP277::well gordon and ariza have been injured the whole season basically, and the hornets still haven't had their projected starting 5 play together in a game yet. and it doesn't help when the coach non-stop changes the starting lineup.
Lindian77::lets face it the hornets just flat out suck.
KeMvP277::Hey monty, why did aminu only play 2 minutes and landry 9 when jason smith played 30? how dumb of a coach do you have to be?? seriously. CP3 made him look like a better coach than he really is last year.
shippmike91::THE GRIZZLIES WINS!!!
Lindian77::GREAt thanks hornets for costing me a ton of money
BowFlexTCTGP::Gasol=2nd best Natural Center in the NBA..  But is the best Finesse Center in the league.. I'm sorry but there is no finesse in DHowards game
popp434343::is the game over?
KeMvP277::4 STRAIGHT O-REBOUNDS FOR MEMPHIS. HOW HARD IS IT TO BOX OUT?
gotigersmemphis87::Pretty hard with Marc Gasol in there
seferson::fk'n hornets suck
gt1master_ike::Uh game over  another loss another day
pst2341::Jack has ben balling this yr
gt1master_ike::Jack has been terrible shooting the ball but not tonight
Szeklinski::The past 6 years I called them the New Orleans CP3s.  Not sure what to call them now.
shippmike91::Grizzlies Must Win This GAME..
shippmike91::We did it
gotigersmemphis87::They will
magic1jordan2::I sure am glad that Stern nixed that trade because it was in the better interest of the Hornet organization.  Glad thats paying off for the team, look how well they're doing.  thanks David Stern the Hornets really couldnt have done it without you
BowFlexTCTGP::Marc should be an all star this yr.. Rudy has put together a good resume to be one too but who knows.. And mike has been one of the best PGs in the west so far this season.. Grizz r gonna b scary good once ZBo returns
Bro-kowski::Just trade Kaman and Ariza, they're useless. Develop Ayon and Aminu with playing time and get draft picks.
Titans Yemen::Got Dat rght.
Titans Yemen::threeeeeeeeeeee OJ mayo
kurtmac1::get speights in the game...
Titans Yemen::Grizzlies we need this win.
gotigersmemphis87::Tigers just lost :(
Titans Yemen::Don't worry they will win C- USA.
gotigersmemphis87::Yeah but they keep losing to teams that they are more taleted than
Bro-kowski::I hate to say this but it's time to fire Monty. This team shouldn't be playing this poorly.
matjon1029::This is a legit question Is Shannon brown related to Chris brown because I think they look a lot alike
Griss13ears::Come on Grizz. Beast mode.
Go Laker Nation::Welcome back Ariza
xxxRollTideRollxxx::score update
gotigersmemphis87::Marc needs 2 rebounds 3 assists for a triple double
peoplethrowingchairs::Did Eric Gordon go to the Baron Davis " Fake a knee injury to gtfo" school?
champion_134::m
suesdi::GGGGGGGGGGGGoooooooomhornets
pst2341::Hows Speights doing
gotigersmemphis87::Not very good 4 pooints 2 rebounds
pst2341::Cant watch this game. Nebody have a link to it
Chandler00000::TRICK basketball SHOTS ;) ;) AMAZING-&gt;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfVxUn1qC9k  ;)
