Jose226165::Skiles fu*ked around and tinkered with the lineup too god dam much.   Also, he would've stunted the development of these young days.  Look out NBA, Milwaukee Bucks playing fast break exciting basketball!
Jose226165::ALREADY It seems like he'll (Boyland) stick to consistent starting lineups and rotations
Jose226165::I was happy to see Skiles go
Aj13721::It's nice that the Bucks actually have some sort of rotation now.
milwaukeemonster2::bulls tell me how my a s s taste!!  -bucks
winfieldbus::really bulls, 10-9 at home? dang
ScalabrineSwag::wait til DROSE comes back buck fans.
ScalabrineSwag::At least boozer keeps on rolling...we will beat the nyk on fri book it
West.By.God.Virginia::lol Bulls.  It matters little how they do this season.  They can't handle the Heat wave with or without Derrick Rose.
FiveFingerDeathPunch1123::nothing better than fair weather, band wagon heat fans
FiveFingerDeathPunch1123::Heave wave, LMAO
Knicks Fan Since the other Week::You shouldn't worry about the Bulls.  Worry about the Pacers, Knicks, maybe Celtics, and yes... I would put Bulls there too.   Heat last 7 games lets see? 1. Lost 2. Lost 3. Barely Won in OT 4. Barely Won in OT 5. Lost (Rose-less Bulls) 6. Win a convincing win (Wizards Wooo Hoo) 7. Lost   Repeat?  Repeat coming short again.
Just Moab::Honey Nut Cheerios.  Just wanted to type that out.
BadgersPackersBrewersBucksWarhawks::Go Bucks!
panther4406::Bucks had 15 blocked shots. damn
OverweightNotObese::Why is Nate Robinson saying anything at all?
Baby J.Cole::http://xat.com/ESPNPeople
Dobby is Free::LOL
Pepsolman::Tough games like this can be won with DRose back. Hang in their guys. Dah Bulls!
InCubaWith2Pac14::Bulls suppose to be like 24-9 right now. we don lost so many games we were not suppose to lose.
D.Wagner85::That is the best thing about the NBA, You never know on a nightly basis.  Bucks themselves should easily be 22-12, but they let a few stinkers get by em.
InCubaWith2Pac14::I wanted the Bulls to get Matt Barnes this summer, so bad..
D.Wagner85::He could have helped a lot.  Bulls should really look at their future and deal Boozer if possible, maybe even Deng.  Mainly Boozer to me because Gibson is waiting in the wings and deserves to play and comes much cheaper.  How would you feel if you had Monta Ellis on your team in a possible 3 team trade that landed Boozer somewhere other then Milwaukee?
InCubaWith2Pac14::I would take Ellis. We need scoring.
D.Wagner85::Bulls and Bucks are truly not that different.  Bulls do have a better team if Rose is healthy, but how about the future?  You have a A lister in Rose, and what else really?  Boozer and Deng are overpaid and overrated, Noah is solid but is a low B list at best, Gibson is the true wild card.  Overpaying players can really set you back in the future, Bulls lost out on chances at Wade and Bosh, to keep Deng and Boozer.  Bucks have a B lister in Jennings, and a likely B lister in Sanders.  And like the Bulls, have a bunch of question marks after that.  Curious to see how the future unfolds for these two organizations.
flip3sixty::@packersswallows  I almost took your comment seriously, then I read your name.  Enjoy Jay Cutler for the next 10 years...just kidding it will only like be 3 years until you unload him for a seventh round pick, but you get my drift.
packersswallowDs::cute
packersswallowDs::the bulls didn't overpay boozer, boozer under performed.
UWBadgers442::Remember when Bulls fans trolled the skiles article?? LMAO!   Bears blow Bulls Blow
D.Wagner85::Bulls fans need to learn respect, Skiles dug that team so far out of the gutter winning with Hinrich and Ben Gordon as his go to players.  Skiles deserves a ton of respect for getting the Bulls back into the playoff picture every year.
D.Wagner85::I cannot believe I read someone comparing Bulls management to Packers management.  Bulls did not do anything right, they were gifted Rose because of the lottery, then made foolish moves to overpay Boozer and Deng, otherwise Rose could, and would likely be playing with Wade and Bosh right now in Chicago, winning rings.  Instead with rose hurt this team is mediocre, and likely do not stand a chance even with Rose because of BAD management decisions.
Its All About The Crew::I liked skiles but this move had to be made
jamacianziggy::The Bucks sure are Boylan Hot   -Channel 12 Reporter
danl3980::once again,why do the big time free agents take less $$ to avoid the bulls?
D.Wagner85::Because the Bulls have no money to give Free Agents, due to bad decisions to bring Luol Deng and Boozer back on massive, overpaying contracts.
Miller Park After Dark::PROST!
danl3980::bulls are so far behind miami,clips,okc,griz,knicks,
Its All About The Crew::Who cares if there behind western teams
packersswallowDs::don't bother, the kids just desperate for attention.
danl3980::the bulls are very good,but they'll never get out of the east
danl3980::big time free agents avoid chicago.why is that?
danl3980::bulls got lottery lucky to land drose,but big time free agents have no desire to go to chicago.why is that?
tannerdavis10::my opinion is trading Boozer and Rip for a good SG who can complement Rose and put Taj in the lineup
tannerdavis10::also because they had a good bench and the other 3 i mentioned would have to be benched or traded
packersswallowDs::none of those players you two mentioned even considered the bucks
packersswallowDs::and i'm taking about the bucks
danl3980::talking about the bulls
danl3980::lbj said no,dwade said no,tmac said no...all took less money to avoid chicago
d_bokk::they had money when Amare, Bosh and Lebron were available
tannerdavis10::not enough $.... already paying boozer noah and deng too much.
tannerdavis10::missed way too many easy buckets and left guys open. the two key reasons for losing a double digit lead.
ChiGuy1002::So is Udoh going to break out and become an All-Star?
d_bokk::way to go bucks, need to beat bottom feeders like the bulls if you want to make the playoffs
stevej2555::Series lead holmes
d_bokk::the bulls are bottom feeders
packersswallowDs::look at the standings holmes
d_bokk::the bucks aren't worse than the bulls, look at the scoreboard holmes
packersswallowDs::and bucks are worse than bottom feeders
Justin01553::not to far from the bulls
packersswallowDs::sooo not to far from bottom feeders
packersswallowDs::if the bulls are bottom feeders with a 19-14 record what are the bucks with a 18-16 record
danl3980::the bulls,with a healthy drose are in nba hell.very good,but not good enough to get out of the east
BadgersBucksPackers::Bulls/Bucks/Pistons/Pacers &gt; Heat
FEAR_THE_HEAT::Bulls are terrible
stevej2555::Miami has lost against every team in the central division except for the Cavs. And that's the division everyone is saying is the weakest hah!
canedbread::Look at the record. Just saying
canedbread::Last Thursday they were not.. We're they?!
Justin01553::Cause they did not have to face the Bucks
canedbread::Lakers should move to the D League so they can win a championship LOL
CubicleJoe::hooray, bucks.
packersfanfrom89::Jennings scored 55 points his rookie year with 0 points in the 1st quarter.  35 tonight with 0 points in the first 16 minutes.  Interesting.
35mikey1313::Wow. Too bad he didn't start out hot. Would've had a huge game
trek - biker GB::Packers OWN da Bears  Bucks OWN da Bulls  Wisconsin &gt; Illinois
whitykj::Packers 4 Super Bowls &gt; Bears 1 Super Bowl Bulls 6 Championships &gt; Bucks 1 Championship  Wisconsin sports= Illinois sports Shut up
packersswallowDs::bears 92-88 &gt; packers  bulls 118-104 &gt;  bucks  Illinois &gt; Wisconsin
packersswallowDs::yet illinois sports &gt; wisconsin sports
Justin01553::Illinois sports suck
danl3980::i compare the bucks management team to the bears management team.......just can't get it right. packer management team to bulls management team...only goal is championship
danl3980::bears fans hate this
BadgersBucksPackers::Great analogy.
13Datty40Zetty::the east is starting to tighten up
raidertatonmyarm2::where is that one genius who called bucks plus 14 second and that they would win by 7 where r u genius i wanna talk to u be my friend
raidertatonmyarm2::at the half this guy said plus 14 bucks and they win by 7 i was laughing at him so hard but he was dead on almost
BadgersBucksPackers::Oh my. He's probably getting some cocaine and some hookers with his winnings.
BadgersBucksPackers::I wonder what his lottery numbers are.
ChiGuy1002::For what it's worth, I do like Larry Sanders.  The show is hilarious!
packersfanfrom89::It was.  The basketball players 7 blocks were even more hilarious though.
BadgersBucksPackers::I like his block parties better.
BadgersBucksPackers::Larry Sanders will lead the Bucks to atleast 9 championships during his career. Moving them to 3rd all tome behind the Celtics and Lakers.
canedbread::High or drunk or both?
BadgersBucksPackers::*Joking around.
packersfanfrom89::9 in a row.
canedbread::Why are you people bringing up the packers? THIS IS AN NBA CHAT NOT NFL please exit
paul3d::Trash talk aside good game Milwaukee!   P.S. We'll be coming for you next game!
packersfanfrom89::Appreciate it.  Thank God Jennings got hot, otherwise this woulda been an easy Bulls win. GG.
raidertatonmyarm2::he didnt get hot man he was the freaking sun
canedbread::5 more to go bucks! And that's just to tie.
GetHype52::Chicago had more murders than Kabul, Afghanistan this year... And that is a warzone! Pathetic, you can't even arm yourselves there.
GetHype52::Exactly, you should have the right to protect yourself.
packersswallowDs::i have a shotgun, that ban was mostly for handguns
packersswallowDs::pretty sure most of those murders were gun related
raidertatonmyarm2::95 percent is gang related bro
packersswallowDs::most of them were gang related
GetHype52::Civilians are not allowed to own handguns in the city of Chi.tcago. Not yet anyway. Pretty sure you don't know what you're talking about.
ChiGuy1002::The last time the Bucks won a title, Lew Alcindor was their Center (Kareem Abdul Jabbar), and you all were just twinkles in your mothers' eyes
stevej2555::For a franchise that the NBA treats like a tick, one championship is pretty damn good.
raidertatonmyarm2::word homie
danl3980::kind of like the last time the beara won a sb
ChiGuy1002::I was 2 and did a mean Super Bowl Shuffle
ChiGuy1002::You're not comparing them to the Bulls history, are you?
Justin01553::So atleast we won one in our history
Justin01553::Kinda like the Bears in football
canedbread::Damn I'm not even going to lie, Luol Deng adds a whole new level of black LOL
packersswallowDs::i don't think i've ever seen a light skinned black person from africa
