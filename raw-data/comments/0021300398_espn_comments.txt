Kyle Miller::Sixers win easily.  Good to see the Bucks giving the young guys big minutes. Best way to learn is from experience.  Go Bucks!
Justin Nixon::unstoppable machine known as Milwaukee Bucks
Tony Hartmann::The East is absolutely brutal.
Tony Matushak::Bucks are the best team in the NBA
Josh Schwartz::If you're going to troll, you honestly need to do better than that.
Kyle Miller::He's not trolling. He just spelled "worst" wrong.
William Hagness::winning serves no purpose for this team!
Kyle Miller::What are you doing Bucks?
Mohammad Jamshidi::As a sixers fan I have to say Shame on them . So many fans invest their hard earned money this crap . They traded jrue Holliday for a rookie that was going to miss the whole season going in just to dump salary . At least get a player to help u . They are tanking season . They will trade turner for a crapy draft pick . What's going to happen next yr? Nothing . More tanking . No star will sign w the sixers next yr . The ownership should be ashamed
Matt Elmore::there's this guy the 76ers drafted that will win ROY…maybe a 76ers "fan" would know who I'm talking about
Rick Voorhees::Mohammad, you better go back to the promised land, MCW is by far going to be a better player than Holiday is...In fact you could almost say that now...
Mohammad Jamshidi::Matt and Rick I agree w u both regarding M.C.W.  a very good rookie . My point is they should have better return for jrue holiday
Matt Elmore::Lol idk who's happier right now: a Bucks fan because the Bucks won or a 76ers fan because the 76ers lost?
Charles Cherry::OVERRRR 201.5!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tony Hartmann::I think Philly has hit a new season low.
Dan Swenson::Is henson in the lineup tonight?
Al-Jaleel Sawab::How can a team play defense so bad?
