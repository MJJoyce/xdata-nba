Bill::The Nets actually won a game?
bgood2life::Brooklyn should be thankful for playing in the N B A's doormat division,Atlantic conference. The team who can absorbed the most mud,will win out. Currently, all 5 teams have a record under 500.
Booster Gold!::Keep Evans on the bench and Brooklyn will win games. They have enough rebounding stiffs
Sanjiyan::Wow, a team from the Atlantic div might be at .500 by the end of the day.
willie::The Nets would not want to be outdone by the Knicks... they will add up another L.
TheErwinator::Pierce is +15, Anderson is -16, and yet they're being played almost the same amount of minutes...
Rohan::What Happened To Gay?
Rhinogold::Yes Raptors fans....Amir Johnson for 3 was the play........... horrible pass by gay, and a horrible play drawn up to get 2 points...
PKM::I thought that 3 pointer at the end was going in.
