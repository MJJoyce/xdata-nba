kzwider::Kyle Lowry got a little fiesty in a summer charity game http://www.the-outfielder.com/2012/02/i-didnt-know-summer-charity-games-were.html
ZachC1965::Ellis &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kobrick
gianluchisti::V-A-G-I-N-A
gianluchisti::BIEDRINS ... isn't a BIRD man ..  is a V-A-G-I-N-A    shemale !!!!
mrkennedy23::People may get angry for this, but I think we might need to move Curry instead of Ellis.  Curry's inconsistency is killing me and I don't see him as an all-star any time soon.  We need a center, and we need one badly.
HiddenCounter::Monta Ellis is like Allen Iverson.  Can't win if he's your main vocal point.   Keep Curry, trade Monta.
hozjo::ijfbhj gvdb vkxb nv sbmg  vbf vs,vkjasfaslfkn l    STOP WINNING GAMES YOU IDIOTS YOU ARENT MAKING THE PLAYOFFS, ONLY LOSING A LOTTERY PICK IN THE BEST DRAFT IN YEARS      sgf8oaesiuf
HiddenCounter::I know we aren't making the playoffs.  But, it just doesn't seem sporting to lose.
Mister.k.::Ellis should be an all-star reserve. Biedrins is a v-a-g-i-n-a
NBA_refs_are_weak::such a waste of 7 feet. please god, I dont even need to be an allstar player, just let me be 7 ft tall in my next life and ill make it happen
NBA_refs_are_weak::good lord is ellis balling lately or what. and the dude isnt at least an allstar reserve? comeon now
rj10328::worst second quarter this season for the Rockets
Oaktown1029::Beidrins - 11 minutes, 0 points, 0 shots, 3 rebounds, and 4 fouls - The most disturbing part of the night - he's actually getting worse!
supe540::Yeah, he's heartless and not even trying.
skewy123::Klay Thompson is 5th in the NBA in 3 point %. Ballin
skewy123::It looks like he's done a pretty good job so far
CougarPrideEndures::Warriors fans way too critical early on of a rookie who missed the first week or so of a strike-shortened training camp.
CougarPrideEndures::I'm sure they do now that they have had a good chance to see him play for a while.
supe540::Every Warrior fan I know like Klay's game a lot.
emonne::Im tired of monta being an all star snub... put him in the game already!
adamjl140::hey its the two teams that gave up on jeremy lin hahahha
Asif11111::HAHA...yeah i met him during the last home game at Golden STate last year. He had a great game then too but MAN i did not expect this at all out of him.
2004 AL Champs::I lose more over/unders in basketball in the last minute and by one point or half a point
Sukalotopus::not that anyone cares but still it SUCKS lol
Sukalotopus::that 1 point cost me 600 parlay win
G0AT420::thats why i stopped betting the over unders unless its a gimme... like in college basketball
2004 AL Champs::I took GS minus 1 and over 203 1/2 two seperate bets
G0AT420::lucky on that push
2004 AL Champs::Tomorrow night, take Louisville over Syracuse, the Orange never play well there

G0AT420::i have hit four 5 team parlays just this week
meow_killer::have you ever hit an 8 team like me??? *pats back*
WonTonChin::I just get so used to the d1cks here that I get out and attack.  Should have been more chill and explained my point.  Good luck with the books, man.
G0AT420::its cool dude... i am uneducated .. i dropped out of highschool.. only took a college class then got over it
G0AT420::yes... i understand
WonTonChin::Parlay bets are paid out at odds higher than the typical single game bet, but still below the "true" odds. For instance, a common 2-team NFL parlay generally has a payout of 2.6:1 if both picks are correct. In reality, however, if one assumes that each single game bet is a coin flip and would be expected to pay out at 1:1, the true payout should instead be 3  Wikipedia on parlay odds.  Now understand, as you add games and the odds multiply......and the payout gets worse as compared to the odds.  Anyways, sorry for being rude, I was out of line.
G0AT420::a statistics class??
WonTonChin::Take a class, fool.
G0AT420::lol obviously.. explain then
WonTonChin::No idiot, you obviously don't understand statistics
G0AT420::you can lose 5 ways ... and its 20 to 1
WonTonChin::It isn't bad, but it isn't mathematically what you SHOULD get based on the statistics.
WonTonChin::Nothing to do with juice it is the number of ways you can loses vs. the payoff.
G0AT420::20 to 1 isnt that bad
WonTonChin::Kind of
Penetra8r::Thats pretty good, 4 5 teamers is pretty tough
G0AT420::only because they take the juice
G0AT420::i must be a idiot??
WonTonChin::Doesn't mean it isn't a dumb bet. If you do the math it is actually a bad payoff
Penetra8r::I can't believe 30 seconds to go and they block a shot.
alouisftb6284::yeah
BreslinCoxInc::I can't believe it's expected these days to just let a team score even when the outcome is more then likely determined.
Penetra8r::I did pal...  02/12/2012-ONLINEat10:08 AM         [#112823598]  STRAIGHT BET (Risking: 82.50 - To Win: 75.00)        02/12/2012 - 06:15 PM  NBA   [810] TOTAL u203½-110 (HOUSTON vrs GOLDEN STATE) Score: HOUSTON(97) - GOLDEN STATE(106)   Won a whopping $75.00
ThrillaInMD::better than losing 300 like the guy did with the parlay
adamike1::should have taken the under, ya doofus!
uxley2::Parlays are for stupid people.
WonTonChin::Yes, even if you win them, the odds are against you in the long run
WonTonChin::Parlays are for the math materially challenged.  The big payout is mathematically a bad deal compared to the odds of losing.
Penetra8r::I won an 8 team parlay once upon a time, I think $10.00 won $800.00 about 15 years ago  Maybe a 6 teamer once upon a time too... but most of the time, they go down the $@%! hole
G0AT420::dont mind him... he is just a idiot who doesnt know anything
ricePaddy69::Even if you win them?
Drew -Bailey::pays well
IAMpunter2609::WRONG
G0AT420::or people who just do it for fun.. i win alot of 5 team parlays
Penetra8r::I guess I'm stupid
uxley2::Parlays are for dumbasses.
Drew -Bailey::that like to get paid!!
G0AT420::i got a 5 teamer going!! all i need is utah + 6.6
meow_killer::haha i took jazz +5 didnt even need it
G0AT420::how u get em -1? tease?
Penetra8r::Go Memphis. I got Memphis 2nd half 57.50 to win 50
DCSeanTaylor21::not bad. I have Mem -1
G0AT420::lol im smart.. only risk 10$ to win 200
DCSeanTaylor21::risk:win?
BallsMahonee::where do you guys go to gamble...?
BuruKatu::It is Lebron's fault....I am on the roof of the MGM taking my last view at this sick world....goodbye world...  Parlay (4 Teams) 	02/12/12 17:37 ET bet 300.00 to win 1,943.08 	Result: Pending Houston Rockets Golden State Warriors 	02/12/2012(21:05 ET) Over 203.5 Miami Heat 107 Atlanta Hawks 87 	02/12/2012(19:12 ET) Miami Heat -175 Stanford 59 USC 47 	02/12/2012(19:35 ET) Stanford -260 Philadelphia Flyers 3 Detroit Red Wings 4 	02/12/2012(19:40 ET) Over 5.5 (-125)
WonTonChin::Parlays are for rookies and idiots
ThrillaInMD::i love the horor
Penetra8r::Parlays are Suckers Bets!
Penetra8r::Half a hook kills... Sorry pal
DCSeanTaylor21::$300 parlay are you crazy
uxley2::1)  It's only $300... 2) Parlays are for dumbasses.
TheMatriecks::CYA DUDE LOL
bandwagoner195::monta is bad mutha fcka
IAMpunter2609::Feel for the over punters, never bother with over/under myself but I took rockets +1.5 so yeah. Hopefully Utah can cover.
ricePaddy69::Haha. Two teams without LINsanity. At least the winning team had an excuse. What's yours, Houston?
rjlcowboy21::i think he meant that GS has their pg of the future already
Joshua110392::Apparently you haven't looked at the standings recently.
Joshua110392::Yea, but I can accept tonite's loss. We'd won our last 3 on the road vs. DEN, POR, and PHX. Plus, considering we'd won 12 of last 13 vs. GS, they were due for a win. I just hope we pay Memphis back Tues. nite. after a blowout loss earlier this season. A big divisional game we need to win.
WarriorsGO::I think he meant winning tonights game.
AJ in Cypress::u ever wonder how vegas knows these point spreads and outcomes so well... pro sports is rigged
AJ in Cypress::wizards been bad all year especially on road...make money betting for them to win
AJ in Cypress::where was da money bet on that game?
DCSeanTaylor21::how did vegas rig that?
DCSeanTaylor21::Did you see the Wizards game today? 22-2 run to end the game when they where +6 dogs
AJ in Cypress::yes it is
G0AT420::no its not
TheMatriecks::Its called money management folks the most you should bet on a single game is about 5 percent of your bankroll fellas
G0AT420::yup same with poker!!!
G0AT420::yea lol at the idiot who said he's beter than vegas and that the 2half under was a lock............. i said it would be easy over 2h and close to the game over... good thing i only bet on gs - 1.5
G0AT420::nice
DCSeanTaylor21::I listened to him, But I also had GS -1 and 2nd Half -4 I think it was. 2-1 not bad
Joshua110392::Dammit, why does Monta always have an awesome nite from the field when he plays us???
Joshua110392::I can't remember the last time Ellis shot worse than 50% from the field against us.
WarriorsGO::cuz u have Martin gaurding him.
Joshua110392::Yea I guess at this point I should just accept it as one of those weird matchup things we see throughout the league.
WarriorsGO::well I can understand Mcgrady, not sure bout Battier or Artest. Maybe just a confidence he gets playing your team. Just like Danny Granger against us.
Joshua110392::Before Marti  we had McGrady when healthy or we'd stick Battier or Artest on him. He stil shot well, don't get it.
WarriorsGO::who was your shooting gaurd before Martin? I dont remember
Joshua110392::Trye, but he did that to us before Martin came here.
DCSeanTaylor21::I'm off to the Mem forum now. Have a good night everyone and good luck betters :)
WarriorsGO::Beidrins with another AMAZING game. 0 points and 2 rebounds. Gotta love our starting Center.
Money Bags Wilson::honestly....if monte ellis hits both free throws i woulda been rich...now i am poor. thanks dude
WonTonChin::Well that is your fault for betting beyond your means on an NBA total.
AJ in Cypress::from money bags to outhouse wallpaper just like that haha
Toni_Reeve6940::Houston Rockets vs. Golden State Warriors   a site with info:   http://bit.ly/AbOhP5
uxley2::69% took the over...lolz...Easy decision to go Under.
uxley2::Lolz...a lot of haters on this board....It's not my fault you kids don't know how to gamble.
WonTonChin::Easy decision in a half point game.  You might be inbred and $@%!$@%!.
Sukalotopus::congrats on your $20 winning
uxley2::Congrats on taking the Over and earning the loss...lolz...BAD
DCSeanTaylor21::I just X2 my TAX RETURN
bandwagoner195::rofl, get a job.
G0AT420::nice lol
GsDubb12::Lmao thanks Monta for missing that free throw at the end so all those clowns talking about the over the whole Game  lose by .5. Lmaoooo hahahahahahahahahaaa
SB4LlFE::haha that was hilarious
DCSeanTaylor21::that's why you buy the 1/2 point
AJ in Cypress::he missed on purpose he had some money on da game lol
G0AT420::THats why u dont mess with OVER AND UNDERS!!!! GS - 1.5 WAS A GIMMEEE
AJ in Cypress::stupid gambler u would have better luck giving me your money to invest lol
greenintegra97::Going to the game tomorrow that will be a win as well
HTownRprsntr::Maybe GS will make it to .500 one day ha!
etaUpike07::rockets played terrible. play like this v OKC and lose by 30
Money Bags Wilson::thats a big money swing for me....dam man monte ellis gotta hit that ft
Sukalotopus::last play by houston he got hacked but they just let it play
wrecko22::landed right on the number 203- 203.5  what a coincidence     yeah right
TheMatriecks::I had 203.5 Sweet that half a point is a winner baby
