Gay Clipper fan.::Anyone going to throw another dinner party today? You would love my peach pie!
Xander::Brad Stevens doing a good job with what he has. Celts have no true superstars (at least with Rondo out) and played the Clips tough.
Matthew::Food for thought -- if Chris Paul and Cliff Paul were supposedly separated at birth, then how do they have the same last name?
Chris Quinn::Emotional game for Doc Rivers!
J_Orz::Is Jordan and Jamal relatives or something?
HIP2CLIP::Clipper had the 3 best players and the best coach on the floor and Boston claims they're rebuilding?
OlaCambada::What kind of coach bails on his team just because some players get traded for the better of the team?  Talk about Ubuntu huh Glen?
Commenter::Rivers recognized he was a no talent coach without All Star players. Instead he decided to take his mediocre coaching skills to a team that is loaded with talent. If Rivers were coaching the Milwaukee Bucks he would be about as popular as Reverend Wright at the Republican National Convention.
Clipperdude::Clipper's going up against the best franchise in the history of the NBA. Funny that Celtic fans never seem to mention 17 rings. They could troll the Clippers board but they don't. Laker fans could learn alot from the Celtic fans, This should be a good game. Let's go Clippers!!!
jr1::Watching the Boston broadcast with Celtics relic Tommy Heinsohn. The guy moans over every call that goes against Boston. I realize that the Celtics announcers have always been the biggest "homers" in sports announcing, but this is ridiculous. He just yelled, "When are you going to blow a whistle for the Celtics?" How embarrassing.
