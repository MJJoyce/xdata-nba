Chi.Twn.Native::Gotta love Jo- thats a workingmans triple-double right there! Best center in the league.   At least Chicago will get a championship with the Blackhawks this year.  The Blackhawks are the most dangerous team in sports right now.
gatorfan15151::3 FORMER GATORS JOAKIM NOAH AL HORFORD AND DAVID LEE HAD 20 AND 20 GAMES WITHIN A WEEK OF EACHOTHER NO OTHER SCHOOL HAS HAD THIS YEAH BABY
Jezeble::Hear, hear!!!
LBJ has more rings at 27 than MJ::Noah is still horrible  Looked completely lost in the All-Star game and most of his stats come from teams being lazy on off nights  Come playoffs he will get back to his usual 3/6/2 ways
gatorfan15151::DUDE NO ONE ASKED YOU IM JUST DEFENDING MY FAV PLAYER DUDE LED THE BULLS IN SCORING WHEN D ROSE WENT DOWN LAST YEAR AND THIS GUY UP TOP IS JUST A HATER BECAUSE JOAKIM CAN GUARD LEBRON AND HAS BLOCKED HIS SHOT A COUPLE TIMES AT THE LAST 2ND
THe BOldin One::dude you have a wierd comment
gatorfan15151::NOAH PLAYS BETTER IN THE PLAYOFFS AND LED THE ALL STAR GAME IN REBOUNDS YOUR JUST A HATER BECAUSE OF HOW HE LOOKS WHAT A SHALLOW MOTHER
Bruce Bowen should be in the HoF::If Noah puts up 23, 21 and 11 in every game of a series against the Heat, the Bulls have a chance!
JonChemRules::no $@%!
RZye::Holy crap! Big props to Noah. Great game.
lebronisachokingbum::Wow the Sixers Blow! Can you imagine What Ibaka's stat line would of been 26 points 18blocks and 11 boards!
MarcyDArcysChickenCoop::They have played this year. Ibaka's numbers.... 15pts, 10reb, 0blk. You were close though.
MarcyDArcysChickenCoop::Nice. ESPN has the Heat Harlem Shake video on their main page.  23pts, 21reb, 11blk? Who cares? THE HEAT MADE A HARLEM SHAKE VIDEO. Keep dropping yourselves in the sh.itter ESPN.
SpudsMcDougal::I wouldn't be too impressed. Even Shawn Bradley had a 20/20/10 line once
gatorfan15151::WELL SAID AND HES FELL JUST SHY OF HAVING LIKE 8 TRIPLE DOUBLES THIS YEAR AND HES 7 FOOT
MarcyDArcysChickenCoop::Has Shawn Bradley ever had a triple double with points, rebounds, and assists? Noah has, a couple times.
jrtall3n7::Now that's an impressive triple-double
Minoli87::No reason why Noah's triple double shouldn't be front page of the NBA section.
kb24underseas::Big Laker Fan and seeing the stats Noah did last night was unbelievable. Even Shaquille had a hard time giving Noah props. Give credit when credit is due.......
HawksCubs10::I was at the game last night, Noah was a man among boys at the UC.  He may be the best center in the league right now, real glad he got into the all-star game this year.  You keep Noah, have Rose stay healthy, and get a few great pieces surrounding them, we will win a championship.  NOah wants one more than anyone, don't let him go until he wins here first!
LBJ has more rings at 27 than MJ::Nah, bro  He effort goes a longer way in the regular season against low effort/bad teams  Onces the 2nd and 3rd round of the playoffs start, teams are trying and these teams happen to be good  Noah doesnt have the skill set so to anything more than 8/7/2  on 34 mins during a game in the Conference Finals or Finals
RoushYatesRockets16::Looks like Noah f*cked around and got a triple double
MinniWolves90::WOW!! Joakim Noah!! Go Gators!
kab747::It needed this monstrous effort to beat the Sixers? Wow! Still let them score 82? Wow! Didn't score over 100? Wow!
01Bulls4life::Psssshh psshh...  The kings have a worse record and the heat let them scored 129, Wow!.   They couldn't win in regulation time, Wow!  But don't tell anyone.
vicmo25 - vol. 5::vs Miami in the playoffs................  Bulls w/ Rose = 2 wins  Bulls w/o Rose = 0 wins
AdamSaidThis::What the media doesn't tell you about the Bulls:  Without a starting pg...we aren't good. Even Hinrich is enough. No Rose? No Hinrich?   Yes we have MAJOR trouble. I like Nate...but he cannot lead a balanced offense. Just cannot.
not the same old miss::noah is a poor man's varejao
AdamSaidThis::lol. Sideshow Bob.
sshrader64::except better?
AdamSaidThis::Joakim Noah is the heart of every team he's ever been on.
Jaguarcrazyboy::What a game for Joakim Noah.. He's trying to save this team right now.
Beef Biscuit::If Dwight Howard did what Noah did it would be top story
Bruce Bowen should be in the HoF::Easily it would be, but if Dwight Howard had half the heart of Noah he'd be the greatest center to ever play the game.
Vodka and Milk::Noah phucked around and got a triple double....
stop the duck10::sixers are the 4th best team in philly behind lesalle villanova and temple
A Moveable Feast::The Sixers are good.  I sure hope they don't think Bynum is saving that mess.
gatorfan15151::20 20 and 10 and over 65 percent shooting noahs the only player in league history since the block became a stat
BustyNeighbor::actually last player since SHAQ in 93 to do so i believe.
SteveBlake_Is_A_Bum::wilt probably did it several times.
Bruce Bowen should be in the HoF::They starting keeping the block stat in 1973 when Wilt retired.
SteveBlake_Is_A_Bum::Noah = DPOY
SMANGANG::Lebron is a lil' B*TCH!!!  - Noah
snazzypanda125::When Larry Sanders did this, NO ONE cared. But with Noah did it, everyone won't shut up.
SteveBlake_Is_A_Bum::maybe it have somthing to do that noah also grabbed 21 rebounds, scored 23 points, 3 steals, 8 - 12 From The field and 11 Blocks ?
gatorfan15151::Larry Sanders didnt have over 20 20 and 10 and shoot over 65 percent noahs the only player in league history since the block became a stat
Theironrod2012::Noah = defensive player of the year  Tyson Chandler can not do this
Ivanov21::Most impressive triple-double I have seen in a loong while !!!!
This_Guy1::Joakim got a triple double and we won. GG, Sixers.
john nope::triple doubles are completely overrated, except when they are like this one
larryflyntboyle::Noah's stat line is the most impressive I've seen all year.
coc1971::Noah is da' man
zZSmOkIn-KuSh24Zz::DAMN! Pretty Impressive game by Noah
