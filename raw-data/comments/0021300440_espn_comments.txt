Brian Jones::Mike Scotts a underrated player, he should get more playing time
Colin Uza::Millsap is one of the most underrated players in the league. Does a little bit of everything.
Patrick Schuepbach::Go Hawks!  I'm going to comment just so this doesn't look pathetic with only one comment on this board...
Andrew Lipham::millsap was a HUGE pickup.  ill take him over josh smith any day of the week.
Yolanda Cross::Pero the Hero
Reeves Cox::Let's go HAWKS! Beat the Bobcats! We lost the BOSS for awhile, that just means Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, and Kyle Korver have to pick it up offensively! Hopefully Lou Williams can do the same.
Reon Romero::OT win again for Hawks, loving late works huh!
Max Klein::That was quite the interesting dynamic. Two players who were teammates last year now the feature players for their respective teams facing off, except that neither still on the same team as they were when they played together.
Andrew Lipham::Bill Simmons @BillSimmons 1h  Pretty sure I just watched Pero Antic hit a 1-legged fallaway 3 to send Bobcats-Hawks to OT. Did anyone see this or did I hallucinate it?
Burkett Black::win or lose tonight the hawks look good this year I think if we could hold on to a 3 seed or a 4 seed and get horford back we could make a little noise in the playoffs but come on hawks lets win tonight to
Yolanda Cross::Well done Louis Williams great free throw shooting.......GO HAWKS
Tommy Van Noppen::I never thought Antic would hit the 3 pter LOL i thought oh maybe Korver or Teague xD
Yolanda Cross::get the ball to Teague to make a clutch 3 and send it to OT
Leon Justice::OK Hawks let's close this one out.
Andrew Lipham::go hawks!!!!!!!!!
Yolanda Cross::any chance of getting a rebound Hawks !!!!
Tammy Page::lets get it bobcats
Tommy Van Noppen::Kyle and Teague need to step it up next quarter..
