Vampire013::Someone needs to tell David Stern that the Bobcats are going to keep doing this until the league lets them have the #1 pick in the draft. It's waaaayyyy overdue.
jessejubilee::The Lottery is the worst, I agree.
BillWaltonsHair::the secret to making the playoffs is just playing charlotte for the rest of the season
RIPCityBizzness::some people are saying Mullens $@%! himself lol im reading his knee needed some rest. Which is it? Trouser Chili or Knee?
RipChipCity::Meyers!
crunchy9487::Finally got word about Mullens and he suffered from a sore right knee and said postgame he doesnt consider the injury serious http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/03/05/2725490/byron-mullens-benched-in-charlotte.html
Mikeferrari23....::Jordan's ego is so big he just doesn't know when to quit  He's already known as the worst owner/gm in NBA history  Hell possibly sports history
Nervous Wreck After That Day::Jerry Sloan wanted to coach the Bobcats...MJ is a stupid as $@%!
MetsxNLxChampsx2013::old enemies diehard...
Mikeferrari23....::So do big arrogant egos!
LoserVille_Hah::you know you are D league level when adrian is taking jumpers ahahahahahah
LoserVille_Hah::"Not necessarily a good defensive night but it was a good win." - who cares stilll a large blowout and easy cover vs the worst team ever
InRihannasGut::Hold upp..... i just scrolled down, and saw people saying Mullens shidded on himself.. wtf? what happened?
MetsxNLxChampsx2013::mullens is sick and $@%! himself on the court
InRihannasGut::JJ Hickson is a FA this summer, the Bobcats should try to sign him.. and then draft Ben McLemore, and draft McAdoo with their 2nd pick  Kemba Walker McLemore MKG McAdoo JJ Hickson  Upgrade right there. lol
Maniacpkt::If portland didn't plan on resigning Hickson, they probably would have traded him
Ill-Blaze::ummm I doubt hickson would sign with a team that not even trying and has made losing apart of there mentality no mid range to big free agent is gonna sign with a team like that unless they over pay
InRihannasGut::actually the bobcats went to the playoffs a few years ago. plus most good teams, want be able to offer him a good contract. but i wouldnt be surprised if portland re sign him,
Ill-Blaze::InRihannasGut - if they pay them, yes they will come.. plus hickson played at nc state, i think they could get him, if they offer him the right amount of money, and with the way their roster look now, they should be able to offer him whatever he wants.  he'll probably re sign here plus if he does go into free agency I gaurentee a better will lure him more so then a team that can't seem to win at all ever since they came into the league
InRihannasGut::if they pay them, yes they will come.. plus hickson played at nc state, i think they could get him, if they offer him the right amount of money, and with the way their roster look now, they should be able to offer him whatever he wants.
Kembaslice::Too bad the Bobcats didn't get Anthony Davis... that would have made them slightly less helpless.. too bad stern sold the first pick to the New new orleans ownership
RIPCityBizzness::Davis is overrated. If he was so good, he would be doing what Damian is doing for us. Dont get me wrong, he's good. But I dont see him making a huge difference
TCluvcarpanthers::*Unfortunately, the woeful Bobcats were not afforded the oppurtunity to get the oft-injured, slightly above average Anthony Davis. Instead, the first round pick was awarded to the New Orleans Pelicans.
NolaJag::Anthony Davis posted a 17, 15, and 4 tonight. If that is slightly above average as a rookie then i'll take it.  Many of the times he has sat out was mainly due to precautions. He is the franchise and is not worth the risk in a non-competitive season. Research a bit more before you post
LoserVille_Hah::$@%! kats were on a mission to get blown out scoring a lot LOL
TCluvcarpanthers::*The Bobcats were looking forward to lose by a large margin of points to the Blazers.
TCluvcarpanthers::Why would I chastise you for liking your own comment and turn around, like a hypocrite, and like my own comment? That's not what I do.
LoserVille_Hah::way to like your own comment you angry fan of the worst team ever, hopefully scam newton wins 4 games this year LOL
MetsxNLxChampsx2013::Bobcats are the worst rebounding team ive ever seen... blazers scored on how many consecutive possessions to end it? And how about sessions waving off his teammate to dribble it out to screw the gamblers
hunter50058::they out rebounded the blazers
mtalbot12::How is that screwing the gamblers when the big play was Portland -13?
LoserVille_Hah::and like awful teams that can't do $@%! ever ahahhahahahaha
TCluvcarpanthers::$#$&amp;^ the gamblers.  Nobody  gives  a  $$^*#$^*  about   them.
TCluvcarpanthers::*Are you mad you're lacking sufficient funds?
LoserVille_Hah::u mad ur broke LOL
LoserVille_Hah::reason to quit gambling when vegas even gets buried on awful team's givin up
TCluvcarpanthers::^ you forgot to like your own comment.
Kembaslice::Damn the Bobcats defens is SOOO BAD
LoserVille_Hah::just fade bad teams and ur rich
Maxi Klinger::They will finish the year with 1 more win, 2 max.....I dont know why Stern allows this team in the league....I dont know why.
TCluvcarpanthers::Goodbye.
TCluvcarpanthers::Nope.
LoserVille_Hah::u mad your teams suck?
TCluvcarpanthers::Stop liking your own comment.
LoserVille_Hah::I guess the bobkitties have more wins than the panthers, ahahhahahahahahahahha
LoserVille_Hah::odds of turdcats winning were less than getting struck by lightning on a sunny day
okc_gambler::lol
LoserVille_Hah::and covering each halves
Maxi Klinger::The Bobcat have some good pieces, they are just horrendously coached, very very badly coached.  There coach simply doesnt have any clue what the f##ck defense is, thats the problem.
RIPCityBizzness::Loser is trolling hard isnt he? Way to keep classy TC
LoserVille_Hah::how's it feel to get blown da $@% out scoring 105?? fuking loser ahahahahahha
TCluvcarpanthers::It feels good because several of our young pieces had nice games.
kdoggizzle::Good pieces? Their #2 overall pick lost to a 50 year old man in a game of one on one.
TCluvcarpanthers::Oh and that same #2 pick played very well today.  17 points on 8/11 shooting along with 10 rebounds
TCluvcarpanthers::The greatest basketball player to ever live...
TANCK25::WHAT HAPPENED TO MULLENS
LoserVille_Hah::michael jordan bought a hunk of dog $@%! for a team
Ill-Blaze::jordan by himself could beat this team in a pick up game
ehart0613::these bums can't even make a layup in the last possession to reward us morons who actually put money on their bum $@%!$?
ehart0613::i've lost far too many plays in my day to ever get mad anymore
LoserVille_Hah::had to let portland score on every shot
TCluvcarpanthers::AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, you mad?
ballerbooboo::why did  bobcats run out the clock at the end...they didn't want to cover the 2h?? lol
LoserVille_Hah::just faded themselves both halves easy cash
bjb7224::fade the bobcats the rest of the year
Kobelies247::He called the $@%! POOP!
LoserVille_Hah::bobcats have a career game and fail to cover both halves LOL
nspur24::In a postgame interview, Mullens clarified the situation.   He actually had a can of chili in his pocket, and it somehow broke open. He seemed very apologetic about it.
terpman7900::is this Mullens story true cause if it is.......
MotorCityMagic35::One of my friends just sent me a picture of her and her cousin bowling with Andre Drummond (Pistons)
LaMarcus Aldridge::What about Andrew Bynum?
