Cyril::Good riddance to Randy Foye.  This guy doesn't shoot well consistently and can't play an ounce of defense. He belongs on the end of that Denver bench where he was stuck tonight. You might as well give Evan Fournier consistent minutes if you're going to give Foye that much playing time.
frank::hope Tyreke Evans can keep this going and play up to his potential. He should be one of those that can play on both end and dominate because of his size and ability.
Anton::Pelicans are looking scary.
Donald::The Nuggets only had four  players in double figures and Chandler had no help.  The difference was that the Pelicans had six players in double figures and four of their starters scored in double figures plus two o off their bench.  the Nuggets had  no energy or intensity and lost heir fifth straight game.
J::Good matchup! I lean towards Pellicans here. They have skill at every position but C. But on the Denver side they also lack skill at only one position: SG.  Go Pellicans! Mardi Gras City!
clint::wonder if they miss Karl?
PKM::Lawson had a bad game but he still only had zero fouls.
milehighcrush::we fired Karl for this?
Knickschamp Tumblr Com::the denver f uggets... lol i miss JaVale McGee
Gary::Davis has been weak since he was injured
