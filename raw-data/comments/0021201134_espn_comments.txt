skuaskua::Will Stern actually allow a team from N. Cal to beat one of his love childern from the south (LAL, LAC) in the playoffs?
derek_510::that is assuming one of those teams gets out of the first round.  and for the lakers, all the way to the finals (unless they secure the 7th seed, i'm assuming they won't get the 6th &amp; warriors stay as the 6th)
longgrassgrows::NOOOOOO steph you need to average 4 3pts per game the rest of the way to get the record
rob31369::I like the Warriors coming back against the bad teams, but they neeed to do it against the elite teams, too.
darwinislord::I had no idea of bad the Suns roster is until I just looked at it.
the.city.::yea when your best player is dragic, you're screwed
Doanface::Suns lose Cavs win  Great day
tman8010::So close to clinching it. Come on Warriors!
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Its tougher when you have no one though. Look at Derek Fisher he was awful on any other team but Kobe use to get him open jump shots. Monte use to have games where he would go 2/20 now hes on the Bucks now he can go off and when its not his night have Jennings take over. It can go either way. Dragic was better in Houston last year when he started a team that had more talent average 18 as a starter.
WarriorsWarrior::Great win clinch sunday!
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::Dragic just went off.
dreballs::mediocre talent can do that on a completely talentless team. Monta used to do it a lot
JahiiCarsons-ASUSFINESTPG::read my comment above. You would benefit from it.
gary_bettman_hearts_the_coyotes::I was really sweating this loss! Thank goodness everything turned out alright! Geaux suns!
Bwoodrow10::good game suns
WarriorsWarrior::good game phoenix goodluck to the faithful
Ben7253::good comeback win by the Warriors! Magic # is down to 2!
mrkennedy23::Can't wait til they seal a playoff spot against Utah.  That's a team I'm confident they can beat.
easyrawlins1::They should come out motivated!
mrkennedy23::They better be.
john.finegan23::Warriorsssss winnn! Ill take it dubs good win, 6 games reamining until playoff time cant wait, watch out for my 2 teams the bulls if they get healthy and the dubs good road victory every road win is good wherever you get it now lets beat the jazz sunday and be that much closer to clinching a spot for the first time in a while.
Semaj_WSU::Never heard Klay talk so much ahah
SB4LlFE::that was just some terrible basketball
SFWildcard::terrible coaching
RStapp35::Look Jackson is clearly not the most talented or experienced coach. That said he certainly has grown in the last year and is coming into his own. Verdict is still out.
SFWildcard::Lee doesnt know that they dont have any foul to give ,
SB4LlFE::jackson drew a play where curry passes to no one for backcourt violation
ballerbooboo::another 2 points added on....WTF?? lol wonder if it help any gambler....
Nathan401466::I'd like to know the last time a losing NBA team shot over 60 percent from the field
ballerbooboo::that just show you if you're a bad team..one quarter can hurt you....LOL
JackTalkSmack5::good job dubs.  hold on to that 6th seed.  can't play okc or spurs.  will get killed.
SFWildcard::Seriously dude, Pop will just make Jackson look like a fool
RickeyHenderson2008::time to troll the lakers
SB4LlFE::phx / Ws games used to be so fun to watch a few years ago
mrkennedy23::Run-n-gun vs run-n-gun.  48 minutes of hustle and reckless shots.  Pretty awesome.
JWiLLgsw::Warriors gonna be dangerous in playoffs
BayAreaFan40::sweeeep
RickeyHenderson2008::is that it? finally?
klippyk::Gambling is that deadly combination of being addictive and stupid at the same time
JackTalkSmack5::wtf is going on with the game clock?  its not moving...
SFWildcard::Jackson is going to be eaten alive by other coaches in the playoffs
JackTalkSmack5::Just hoping Curry, Lee, Jack, and Thompson go off.
mrkennedy23::I'm just hoping he was high tonight.
ballerbooboo::DRAGIC  wanted to score more points so he went for a 2 instead trying to ACTUALLY make it a game by shooting a 3...lol
IAmJonasJones1::or if he hits a 2 and the warriors miss a ft....  ...don't think too hard...
Semaj_WSU::Stupid refs... game is over...
Computer_Wiz_Dude::gambling
IAmJonasJones1::The Warriors tried to give the Suns the win but thankfully they didnt take it
IAmJonasJones1::Suns lose!!!
RickeyHenderson2008::nice
RickeyHenderson2008::good, rather have curry at the line than jack
mrkennedy23::My bad. I thought you were a suns fan.
RickeyHenderson2008::no lol
JackTalkSmack5::wow, this 18secs just doesn't move
K-WADE::this might be the longest final minute in nba history
klippyk::Nice free throw form. Reminds me of andris biedrins
K-WADE::O'neal classic turnover
5 min of Funk::Gd trying to lose unreal
JackTalkSmack5::come on dubs!
5 min of Funk::How do you not know out of timeout
mikexgswfan::curry taken out for the turnover he caused. good coaching
Drun2400::it was for defense. Bazemore is a better defender.
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::no, he was taking out for rebounding
JackTalkSmack5::whats going on?  the channel died.
AthleticWarriorRaiderPaisa::suns hit a 3 to tie
SB4LlFE::wow, another stupid play.. one of jackson's worst coached game ever
RockyMountainWay1::huh?
5 min of Funk::Wtf r they doing?
john.finegan23::One stop lets go dubs
5 min of Funk::Hold the freaking ball curry fool
230_Million_Dollar_Payroll_Championship::gotta get a stop here
HowBoutThemSparties::Update??
klippyk::Enjoy getting swept by the Warriors
