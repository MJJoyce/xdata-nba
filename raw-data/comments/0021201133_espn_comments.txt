solidla::crazy mormons!
oneandonlybabe::Too bad the refs won in LA. Utah should have been back as 8th seed but the poor Grizz didn't stand a chance
BigPappy09101::Funny how you talk about LA on every single board
jason21382::UTAH&gt;Lakers to the very end
hockeygoon79::Whatever happened to ensign.devyn??
lilstu3::Corbin benched him.
too legit to quits::<a><b>I love how everyone is making fun of the Lakers. It will be even sweeter when we hoist the Lombardi trophy this year and watch all the haters eat crow.</b></a>
prismc::LOL so Vince Lombardi played in the NBA

scow79::Anthony Davis:  24 points, 12 rebounds and 3 blocks in 31 minutes.   I'm just glad the Jazz haven't been overdipping their oreo cookies like New Orleans.
nodonovan1377::Good win by the Jazz tonight. Just keep it close w/the Lakers, they will fall back to you.
milk_n_cookies14::Sorry were gonna have to  take Vasquez from you
yesir504::Trust me u can have him lol
Moski87::Hornets/ Pelicans continue to develop and grow, and Anthony Davis is awesome! Future is bright for us. Good Game Jazz fans. Good luck in the hunt for the 8th seed.
McBoogerBallz::wrong forum you should say "lol gl next year Jazz fan cuz Hornet z gunna fak u up so badly that u will have hard time walking... and Fakers will get the 8th seed for sure... so...enjoy your dark ages"   get real son!
jason21382::Ah.........WTF??
winnumber101::What the hell did this guy just say?
WeAreMarquette 2.0::Jerel McNeal rode the bench like a champ tonight.
milk_n_cookies14::a.ss
Landon57991::Good game
blacbird3::New Orleans gave jazz false hope tonight..lol
blacbird3::After lakers beat the grizzlies tonight you'll be put back down to reality
King-of-The-Echo-People::LOL, Lakers fans are the ones who have to face reality. Jazz fans know they have a team that's rebuilding.
JWalk9267::only 3 jazz players have shot free throws
King-of-The-Echo-People::It's pathetic. Kanter would have multiple trips to the line if he was playing. The refs might get a finger cut off if they don't do what Stern says.
FS_The_2nd::Well, Jazz fans, NO has done its job. Thank you and good night
KyberAntillies::Utah &gt; San Antonio
milk_n_cookies14::Why the hell did Corbin even bench Carrol  in the first place?
rbmw263::He found out that Carroll had only been in the league a few years
King-of-The-Echo-People::He was playing too good. Corbin logic.
mikeisildur::he dumb
blacbird3::After we beat grizzlies tonight you'll be right back to ninth seed....
Maximus_Reeves47276::Do not forget to draft your nba team for Today:  http://tinyurl.com/free-nba-challenge2
milk_n_cookies14::Already did it!
dwade grater den jordan 15.0::jazz whod u rather have? hayward or gallo (if he didnt mess up his acl)
JazzFanFromINDIA::Hayward !
milk_n_cookies14::Hayward
JazzFanFromINDIA::3 more assists Millsap for a triple-double.
dwade grater den jordan 15.0::I WANT 2 PARTY WIT U
King-of-The-Echo-People::I'm just surprised he actually decided to rebound this game.
milk_n_cookies14::FLASH!! OHHHHHH!!!!
WeAreMarquette 2.0::#FreeJerelMcNeal
rbmw263::G Time makes up for an awful first half
mikeisildur::In STYLE
dwade grater den jordan 15.0::LAKERS THINK THEY WILL WIN THE TITLE BUT CANT EVEN CLINCH 8TH  #PATHETIC
mikeisildur::Wow, from 1/8 to 9/17.  Way to recover, Hayward.
milk_n_cookies14::Damn Hayward lookin hella good
Moski87::Anthony Davis is awesome! We gotta start building a better team around him.
Moski87::I mean his future with us has always seemed to be in doubt. I would like to keep him, but knowing Dell Demps, anything can happen. Going to be an interesting offseason.
rthomas_83::The Hornets could start by cleaning house. I like Monty, but he can't coach. Dell is an incompetent GM.
Moski87::For who? Who could you possibly get back for him if you do trade him?
FS_The_2nd::Don't know. I was kinda being halfway serious
FS_The_2nd::We can start by trading Eric Gordon!
JHazlem::gotta love jeffersons push shot
milk_n_cookies14::eh
milk_n_cookies14::so..
JHazlem::you're gay
avsnugsroxbroncs21::good finish jazz!
dwade grater den jordan 15.0::HAHAHAH @ LAKERS
TheJTram::Anthony Davis can become the next KG (No lie) as long as he adds muscle/weight to his build and continue working on his offensive game
JHazlem::game over dudes
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Commissioner Gordon and Monty Hall had words and now Gordon is at the end of the bench sulking like a child. Lol
rthomas_83::Can't wait til Gordon is traded. He's been made out to be a bad guy since he's been in NO.   Before he was traded, 100% positive rep on and off of the floor.
mikeisildur::And people want the Jazz to get him?  No thanks
FS_The_2nd::Gordon deserves to be benched.
dwade grater den jordan 15.0::i want 2 fly 2 india and party wit jazz fan
rizzo is da real deal 1::link
dwade grater den jordan 15.0::redtube.com
JWalk9267::Hayward's picked it up a bit but he still had a bad first half which isn't acceptable
JazzFanFromINDIA::He ain't Lebron.Good Game Overall !
dwade grater den jordan 15.0::HEAT &gt; FAKERS  LA FANS SUX
dwade grater den jordan 15.0::jazz dnt even deserves 8 scede but I HATE LA
mikeisildur::looks like a lakers fan pretending to be a heat fan to me
milk_n_cookies14::No one deserves an 8th seed its just whoever sucks the least
avsnugsroxbroncs21::jimmer should go to the jazz. he's mormon he'd fit in!
The Charlotte Bobcats finally didnt lose by 20::Let's all take a mind off this game, and read my name
dwade grater den jordan 15.0::LOL @ REAL SALT LAKE   HE SO MAD RITE NOW!!!!
FS_The_2nd::Apparently Monty chewed EG's a$$ out and now he's getting benched. For those who were wondering
rthomas_83::Eric Gordon is BY FAR the best player on this team.   I hope they trade him. The Hornets are F'N garbage.
rthomas_83::Hell no...
FS_The_2nd::You a Hornets fan?
milk_n_cookies14::It was a good  call tho
Real_Salt Lake::Can't believe I still watch this garbage league
rizzo is da real deal 1::link
mikeisildur::Ganon
King-of-The-Echo-People::Zelda
mikeisildur::Holy balls.  This is ridiculous.  The Hornets have never seen such preferential treatment in their lives.  All for the Lakers
adamsbrian88::#$% you stern
JHazlem::i like kanter, he plays hard and has definitely been improving
