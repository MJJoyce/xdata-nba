Jeff::Snell needs more minutes, he's very productive when he does get some pt.  It will just help him develop that much faster. especially for a team struggling to score.
Richard::Just another loss for a bad team, Bulls have problems that will not be straighten out for years.
juvanee::Chicago loss at home court again.
Teams stink::I actually was stupid enough to believe the bulls had started to have some kind of decent team, after 3 wins in a row and then I saw them play this game.  They are complete garbage.  No decent player to lead that team, period!  They can't buy shots with this bunch of bums!
Chuck::Could we possibly see 6 wins in a row for this Bulls team?
stuart::Seraphin was traded by the Bulls for nothing except to dump Hinrich and his salary.   Was this a good deal for the Bulls fans?
Danny Butterman::Nice game from Nene, but damn, learn to shoot free throws!!
Tony Anthony::Both teams moving the ball pretty well in the 1st. It's nice to watch.
Miami Best::chicago scrubs might as well clean their garbage team
Lkhagva::Boozer didn't play good. He should have 30 pts and Wizards should score 10 pts less if he worked on defense.
