david508540::Evans off the bench really gives us some major offense for the second unit. Even though the second unit is playing well themselves. This all bodes well for the team in the future.
awallock8::Nice...inconsistent minutes for Jimmer again. Goodness gracious.
warkoch::classic jimmer jockey
david508540::That was my question of the day, was Evans going to take a back seat to Salmons. He put his ego aside and did the right thing.
arsenal1470::props for Evans for playing off the bench ....
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::I'm out. GG and GL Grizz. GN all GO KINGS!
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::DMC was #2, but should have been #1 because 1 was just a dunk by griner the dude
panthergang::Is there anyboydy else that cant resist the  blackjack once the games are over
panthergang::nobody &gt;&gt;&gt;
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::I don't bet at all
305sincebirth::I still say DMC and tyreke and a draft pick for dwight and another player would have been legit. oh well just a random thought....
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::not doing that for a rental
305sincebirth::true
jeffymacleod::should have traded tyreke evans for a first round pick to the timberwolves along with thornton for pekovic. if evans aint gonna start might as well get an up and coming center who is averaging a double double when starting
arsenal1470::not thornton ...
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::he doesn't have to start to be useful
jeffymacleod::why isnt tyreke evans starting? not a kings fan like most of the world
jeffymacleod::sounds like he isnt a star to me, trade him
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::he was hurt last 2 games where the kings blew the doors off C's and Wolves, and he wanted to not mess it up by starting and volenteered to be a bench player.
rolando77::DMC's dunk was monster! Grown man bidness.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::good job kings
JBurhenn253::big game for zeke tonight! nothing makes for a better night than to see IT handle his own and watch my dawgs beat our rivals!
Mikecito::This game was amazing.  Jimmer only played 6 minutes and he still pulled off a win for the Kings! It took everyone else like 5 times that long.  Jimmer!
yorkkallday::nba player fantasy draft lebron goes #1 dwade not in #12 see whole thing here http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/
Psychrates::THey're gonna cheat IT out of ROY.
dahojas::by FAR Kyrie deserves it motr than IT. Kyrie is a franchise top'm player that will eventually be an allstar, IT will never even sniff an allstar vote. Get real dude
david508540::By far? I think only because Kyrie beat IT head to head.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::IT can be an AS, but Kyrie deserves it
Psychrates::Nope. If he sustains this level of play, he changed the Kings' season. He's far more valuable and putting up damn good #s.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Kyrie changed the cavs team
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::well Kyrie deserves it easily but IT could be top 5 in voting. If IT was starting game 1 then maybe he gets it
KeithDFL::Good night you sac of f-u-c-k-e--s--rs   what a bunch of lame $@% fans sitting on their $@% when they were winning the game in the end toonight.. lol
KeithDFL::Kings SUCK&gt;&gt; LOL
Goon-::Thorn should be in the discussion for most improved.
KeithDFL::Most improved at cokckckck s uuuccckkkerrrr
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::maybe, but Lin shouldn't win. I say it because he got almost no time last year so to improve on that is very easy. Thornton has played great last 3 games
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::If we got Davis and can have AD/JT as PFs with DMC/Hayes/Whiteside as our C's, that would be great
dahojas::Dude you really need to learn more about the game. The past bit JT has been phenominal and unstoppable, i'd say even out performing anyone on the team. No one should start over him right now
Psychrates::I like Davis over JT and Whiteside over hayes.
DaleHammers4::anyways, night guys, great game again
KeithDFL::Night f - u - c-k - e r... Tell your fans out there to maybe stand up and cheer and perhaps your city will build a stadium... lol  and get some good players
david508540::They did stand up and cheer, what are you blind or just stupid?
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::gn GO KINGS!
rolando77::Keith, Chef, your mom is calling from upstairs. Your pizza rolls are done. You know it's almost bath time, and you've got to get a good night's sleep. You're going to work on your multiplication tables tomorrow! Night kids.
KeithDFL::OH I love pizza rolls too... they are delightful.... sometimes they can be muy caliente if they are over cooked..
david508540::You are a tinkerbell arent youKeith? Yup cause, any guy would not use the d word. Icant even say it, I feel like I would be insulting my manhood. 8 year olds eat pizza rolls, whats wrong with you?
rolando77::Don't forget to plug in your night light.
KeithDFL::Rolando.... are you frustrated... are your thongs in a wad... lol.  I am quite content with my comments about your Sac Kings... where is Chris Webber when you need him... OH  GO Lakers  how about that loss you had to them in 2000   hahahahha.... SO... I am not a kid $@% hole... lol
KeithDFL::Rolando.... why are you so melancholy?  Because of the copius amount of bull $@%! about the Sac fans...
david508540::Meloncholy!? Hahaha what a weirdo. Are you melncholy,LOL Keith do you often get bullied at school, of course you do.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Lob to Outlaw, DMC jam, IT up and under. Plenty of options for SC top 10, hope 1 of them is there
pedrobear1::But i only caught the top 5 of sc and number 1 was Britney griner dunking (-__-)
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::she's the man
Psychrates::SC hates us.
pedrobear1::SC only like OKC, LAL,LAC NYK, MIA and CHI
DaleHammers4::lets hope they play it out and continue it next year team has massive potential, just hope they reach it
Psychrates::Someone like that, or hell...AK47.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::AK47 eh
Psychrates::He's trade bait then. They'll need another complimentary player, not a  scorer. Not enough ball to go around. Someone like AK47.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::well AD is a PF, but if we get a good SF then yes Reke can go
Psychrates::IF we get Anthony Davis or MGK, Bye-Bye 'Reke.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::i know
KeithDFL::I did not bet  lol  I just am a fan of League Pass on DirecTV
DaleHammers4::for your sake, i hope they win a lot of games this year *rolls eyes*
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::HEAD@$$
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::IDIOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
KeithDFL::sac of balls.. lol
DaleHammers4::my god its funny watching all these bettors get madder than hell when they lose a "sure bet" against the Kings guess they should pay attention to how they are playing lately lol
KeithDFL::Sacramento F-u-c-k-e-r-s sux lol... worst fans in the league.. hahaha
KeithDFL::Listen your team will always sucks..... they suck suck suck... fanssuck too  you all were winning that game in the end and the $@%!$ just sat there on their fat $@%!$.. lol
KeithDFL::how many gold teeth do youhave  lol
KeithDFL::Are you Mr T... LOL&gt;... i bet you are as dumb as he looked  lol
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::you must have no life, I pity the fool
Psychrates::That's the way to use Tyreke.
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::I don't always bang dudes, but when I do, I perfer my mom -John Salmons
mark52587::perfer? really?
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::keep crying dik
Palmz28::All caps makes a statement but unfortunately that statement is "I never say or type anything of substance so hopefully yelling will get me some kind of attention". Any press is good press?
Psychrates::THAT IS THE WAY TO DO IT.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::with evans playing
Psychrates::Evans played properly, but still went into hero mode with 2 mn left...
Goon-::Marc Thorny's on a tear.
KeithDFL::KIngs Suckers.. lol
KeithDFL::You first a s-s f-u-c-k-e r  lol
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Get out troll
MNSPORTS93::PS Chef, you are still pathetic.

Psychrates::Yeehaw.
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::LISTEN SANDUSKY FU.CKERS YOUR TEAM IS GARBAGE. GETA LIFE. IDIOTS. SHORT BUS LOSERS
MNSPORTS93::LOL HE STOLE THE SHORT BUS INSULT I USED ON HIM. Weak, bro.
charliedryden::haha this guy is really trying his hardest to $@%! people off. good try kid.
MNSPORTS93::Alright, I'm gonna leave now, sorry again Kings fans.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::GN and GL to your wolves
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::KINGS SUCK
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::WOLVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
springfresh33::OWWWWSUCKKKKKKKKKKK
KeithDFL::Kings have the worst fans... what a bunch of weird people... Who lives out there in that place.. lol
Psychrates::Drunken Delta Breeze. Best experience.
Psychrates::We're afraid to cheer because we assume we'll lose. Truth.
alekb1::Nice to see ignorance on full display.  Yeah living is Sacramento is terrible.  I mean it's only 75 degress half the year and the fans working Mayor Kevin Johnson just saved their team from moving.  Other than that it's a pretty bad place and the fans aren't that into it.  Go back under your bridge troll.
scarfaceCA::well i'm glad you watch sooooo much NBA league pass because that's such a good examination of how a city is....good job kiddo ; )
KeithDFL::Sac Suckers
KeithDFL::Well your crowd sucks d-i-c-k  ol
KeithDFL::Well you place sucks  what a bunch or weird fks
KeithDFL::Not mad... lol.. i just tell it like it is dude.. lol... :)  I watch al the games on TV NBA league pass and the fans are so quiet at Sac games... go their finger up their aws
scarfaceCA::i live in that place you $@%!
DaleHammers4::no they dont, we are just tired of paying to go to a game when the owners refuse to pay for good players it will pick back up
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::u mad?
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::MICOPENI.S THORNTON IS GAY
MNSPORTS93::Really witty.
DaleHammers4::just ignore his trolling man, soooo not worth the effort
KeithDFL::Cuz I know they are Thugs
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::MARCUS THORNTON NEEDS TO GO SUCK A CO.CK
rolando77::the latest update from his mom's basement.
MNSPORTS93::Get back on the short bus chef.
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::WAT DA HALL IS A SHART BUS?
OOHnirav::I'm kinda a bandwagoner for the Griz, but this was a well fought win for the Kings despite Cousin's lack of play time. One question, since I haven't been following the Kings too closely this season. Why isn't Tyreke starting anymore? And why did he play such few minutes? Is he in the doghouse for something, or he coming back from injury?
OOHnirav::Thanks, Pedro and Dale and ashergrl. Question answered.
OOHnirav::Good to know. I'm not particularly fond of the Kings, but I am always a fan of good basketball above everything else, and Tyreke definitely showed promising things in the beginning of his NBA career.
DaleHammers4::np dont worry about him, hes just slowing back into the lineup after injury
ashergrl::He's coming back from an injury - missed the last two games.  He was actually scheduled to start tonight, but he told coach, "They're playing well this way. Let them start and put me in when you need me." Team player :)
OOHnirav::Oh wow.. I thought he was the best player on the team, so it surprises me that they went in that direction.
OOHnirav::Ah, well I was just basing it off his rookie season and the fact that Cousins has been billed as locker room cancer for some time now. I'll take your word for it, since the basis of my opinion is pretty weak.
DaleHammers4::actually Cousins is easily the best player on the team JT and IT are both pushing for that status though Evans is good, but he pushes things WAY too much
DaleHammers4::first night back from injury, he asked coach to bring him off the bench tonight since the team was playing so well without him
pedrobear1::it was his idea i believe they were playing well without him so he asked to come off the bench
Psychrates::They're gonna cheat him outta ROY.
Forever KINGS::<b>Main Reason is the Emergence of Isaiah Thomas (IT) He is now the Starting PG. Great kid from UW (Univ. of Wash.) This Rookie was picked up as the Last Person from the Draft. No. 60 out of 60. He's Ballin' </b>
DaleHammers4::Evans is maturing rapidly this year, you gotta give him that, him and DMC both are things are looking up in Sac
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::which I'm shocked about
The Amazing Chef Minnesota::AT LEAST U ADMIT IT BITC.H
pedrobear1::well horrible d by the grizzlies and didnt matter who was on cousin or thorton the were dominate nice job kings fans and goodluck
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::ty, GG GL
KeithDFL::King Thugs.. lol
rc021363::Alright, GG Kings!  Until next time..... Nite!
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::GG GN GL
KeithDFL::Sacramento you must have the most unlively crowd.. One would think they were losing.  I have NBA league pass, and the Kings fans just sit on their $@% and do nothing... Da,m
rolando77::Go to the game and cheer then. Show them how it's done. Oh that's right, you have league pass. Thanks for the observation Sherlock. Check out those polar ice caps. Guess what? Democrats and Republicans disagree. Shocker.
chadwi12::at least they dress sharp... lol.....
DaleHammers4::used to be better, most Kings fans gave up when the Maloofs decided to screw over the team in an effort to move Sac used to be one of the best places fan-wise
