Jimmy::Westbrook didn't even accidentally get an assist?  Never seen a PG play 30 minutes and register a cheerio in the assist dept.
KMike::What's Adams been averaging for minutes so far this year?
tirthapada::I just don't think the Pistons are using Andre Drummond to his full potential yet. The big three have to gel with Jennings, otherwise, another boring season for Detroit. Hopefully, they will figure out the Chemistry.
KMike::That's what I was hoping Jennings would take to a little more along with Smith, playing off each other. Tonight Smith has played more inside at times with success, and Jennings is dishing it to him.
KMike::Pistons have a ways to go because they're still trying to figure out what combinations work best, but they're a hell of a lot more entertaining than a scant two years ago when they we're just terrible.
Josh::why would you have Jackson at point there probably going to lose if they don't switch that up and plus Oklahoma is at the top of their Conference but that doesn't mean they couldn't beat them so I'll have to wait and find out
lil d::Why every game okc shoot damn near 50 free throws a game! Over half of Durant points come from the line no wonder he score so much and his field goal percent is good. I realize when Durant don't get his free throws in he don't have a good game I'm not even doggin his game he can score but I think he's overrated and Westbrook is the better player
kokkopop::Perkins time on court ( OKC thunder) -14 pts, Adams +14pts. Coach needs to do what is so blatantly obvious.
OK Beer Drinker::How about Adams!! Perk might as well head back to Houston and fight with ladies. He seems to do better at that.
KMike::Durant is a hellava player.
