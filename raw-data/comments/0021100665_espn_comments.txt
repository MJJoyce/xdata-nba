bomborivera1::Rick Adelman is a magician. How the hell did he know *Tolliver* was the secret weapon tonite?
bomborivera1::Oops I meant to post that on tonights game!  Forgot I was looking back at last night's board! Lol
Kaaay17::Who is JJ Barea kidding he was like 2-10 against Jazz 3-7 against Kings...
walnutkid07::Minne thinking about signing Fisher? Couldn't hurt their chances.
EastSacTay::Sad to say it but it's time to move Reke.  The offense moves the ball so much better without him. He dribbles way too much and then settles fall a fall away jumpshot.
-LOS LAKERS::send him to the Celts
-LOS LAKERS::J.J. Barea &amp; K-Love fighting on the bench . . ?
luvnbayes::Can one player (Rubio) make THAT much of a difference?  He can when he was providing the liitle bit of savvy and intelligence that the team had.  And they miss Rubio especially on the defensive end.  The Wolves were 18-12 when he started, and now are 4-12 when he doesn't.   The future looks bright, but not until Ricky returns.
themightyrule10::let's be real here-   JJ barea shoots and controls the ball WAY too much, unnecessarily, and I guarantee that's what Klove was calling him out for on the bench last night. JJ is NOT an offensive threat, pass the damn ball and TRY to fill part of the massive void left by ricky rubio.  JJ needs to understand his role. We can't keep wasting games.....sooner or later the numbers will be against us and then the wolves will be watching the playoffs on their couches
luvnbayes::You are a true fan.  I knew the playoffs were out of reach the second I heard about Rubio's injury.  The team's IQ went down a ton along with his knee.  I predicted 9-16 for the last 25 games without him, so far they are 1-4.  By the way, I agree about Barea.  Another terrible Kahn decision.  He wants to shoot everytime he touches the ball and can't guard a soul.
brooksja55::sooner or later? the numbers are already against us
Antiquity001::I guess Kevin Love doesn't realize JJ is the one with a ring.
dozgod::at least twins season didn't start yet
Andrew-Baugh::Awwww poor tumblewolves :( f*ck you :)
NikezOnMyFeet::ShittyWolves
sklater::So, was chad here tonight?
scubasteve520::I'm a curious outsider. Before the Rubio injury, I looked at the T-Wolves roster and thought you guys had some potential. Maybe in a few years things will be better when players like Rubio and Williams have developed. But it seems to me like your record should be better than it is. Can a Minnesota fan please explain this to me?
luvnbayes::The short answer is Ricky Rubio.  With him, the team plays with some savvy and intelligence.  Without him the Wolves are a bunch of dunderheads.
travishilstad::poor finishes to games...we were just finding ways to win games rather than lose them right before the Rubio injury. Also we started the season slow with Rubio coming off the bench. With Rubio as a starter our win percentage is pretty good, without him it is poor. This is a young team developing and have received a major setback. We should have a better record, but we dont. Also Darko was playing significant minutes early in the year before the discovery of Pek
RIP Brick Rubio and His Horrible FG Percentage::James Hardens beard &gt; Twolves
scubasteve520::Chuck Norris isn't even &gt; than Harden's beard
karelp::It's starting to look like Rubio was really valuable.
themightyrule10::The wolves should have made a move for a point guard. Offense has talented scorers but no flow. also, Anthony Randolph and Michael Beasley deserve more playing time.
polomontana::Adelman is a horrible coach.  He acts like Wesley Johnson has to be in the starting line-up and now this Martel Webster guy. Start D. Williams and Barea at point. Mix things up a little. One of the reasons Marc Cuban picked Rick Carlisle in Dallas to coach is because statistics showed he was quicker to change line ups. This showed in the playoffs when he started Barea early against Miami and it took Spoeltra until the last game to start Chalmers over Bibby.  Adelman acts like he can't change line ups and adjust. Start D-Will and Kevin Love with Barea at point and see what happens.
Psychrates::You're gonna go to the playoffs this year. From a Kings fan, shut up and enjoy what you have.
polomontana::Exactly!!  The idiot Kings fan hasn't looked at the NBA standings in the West.
MNSPORTS93::haha not if we keep playing like this...
themightyrule10::It's ridiculous to keep michael Beasley and dwill on the bench like he does. Also, keeping Anthony Randolph in his dog house is getting old.....
themightyrule10::and Wayne Ellington can certainly contribute, but adelman refuses to change things up
kgrovesBYUfan::GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO KINGS!!!
THE AMAZING CHEF BACK FROM THE DEAD::OK WOLVES FANS A TRUSE HAS BEEN REACHED WITH NUGGET FANS WE DONT TROLL THEM ANYMORE.

kobe-needed-gasol-and-shaq::[blink]Wtf happened to EVEN [/blink]
Jg2.o::Thank god Rick has freed Anthony Randolph a bit.  I've been saying it over and over - - Get the kid some dam minutes!!!
RIP Brick Rubio and His Horrible FG Percentage::I thought Rick was the COY?   How come he cant come up with a plan to beat easier teams?
kenbomc::Not sure we know how to play without Pek.
RIP Brick Rubio and His Horrible FG Percentage::Remember when the Wolves were .500?   Me neither... lolz...
Timberwolves NBA CHAMPS::remember when the cavs were .500 ...... oh wait nevermind
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Well I'm out, GG Wolves. Another big win without evans, he needs to be a bench player when he returns. GN all, GO KINGS!
Forever KINGS::<b>Tyreke is the Kings 2nd Leading Scorer Avg 17.1 ppg.  He needs to be in the Game, not on the Bench.  GO KINGS!!</b>
pistola916::Kings starting to look like a basketball team. Watch out in a few years when this team grows and matures in their new downtown arena in 2015!
MNSPORTS93::As a Wolves fan, I wish you nothing but the best.  We have been where you are before.  Well, we're still kinda there I guess.
Forever KINGS::<b>Kings are Improving. I will be at the New ESC Downtown in 2015. They will Surprise some Teams this Season with Young Talent. GO KINGS!!!</b>
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::with some draft picks they are going to be better
spong3bobrox::Does anyone know why Love and Berau got in a arguement?
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::no
Registeratsportsbettingstar::Question: "What is Bosh's first name?"    Heat "fans" : "uhhh... Rupaul?"
david508540::KL is an a$$hole. He always be taking headshots with elbows and stuff. Cousins gave him one early just to let him know, how Big Cuz gets down.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Evans should be benched when he returns next to jimmer, this starting 5 is doing great the last 2 games
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Well both teams have bright futures
david508540::Thats sounds like a perfect rotation. Just wondering if Evans ego will allow him to put the team first.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::I wouldn't be shocked
david508540::Yup, its good to see them improving. Just hope Tyreke "the Sneak" dont mess it up when he come s back.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::he needs to come off the bench, it's important to improve this season to get better for next season
david508540::They have had great defense last two games.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::kings defense has been better the last 2 games but it needs to be consistent
XxLeprechaunxX::against inconsistent offenses though, but good defense nonetheless
XxLeprechaunxX::yeah both teams have some things to figure out, but they are both worth watching and have very young talented players
XxLeprechaunxX::yeah NBA success seams to be all about defense surprisingly
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Kings can really score but have horrible defense and needs to be a good passing team.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Wolves brighter because they have the best PF in the NBA, a good rookie pg, and the better coach, but both have the playoffs in their sights in the coming years.
Kyrie Irvings poor passing skills::except for Wes Johnson, Luke Ridnour, and J.J. Barea then ya i think we do
kobe-needed-gasol-and-shaq::WTF happened to Evens?
Forever KINGS::Tyreke injured his ankle 3 games ago on 3/14 vs Pistons. X-rays Negative. Nursing injury. Watched games in civvies. Listed as Questionable. Kings are Winning w/o him :-)
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::he got hurt and has watched his team get 2 blowout wins
david508540::He twisted his ankle or somethin. Hope he stays on the bench.
Kyrie Irvings poor passing skills::hi
XxLeprechaunxX::Robbie Hummel has 22 points in the 1st half against Kansas
Registeratsportsbettingstar::Inside jokes with complete strangers
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::anybody still here?
Kyrie Irvings poor passing skills::ya
david508540::Lil JJ was in Loves face, wonder what they were mad about besides the score.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::okay
Kyrie Irvings poor passing skills::Man we suck without Rubio there goes our playoff chances...oh well better draft pick that means
XxLeprechaunxX::in the second round
arsenal1470::Kings starting lineup should be IT,MT,JS,JT,DMC and Evans should be the 6th man
Psychrates::THe line up is fine as is if you put Jimmer in @ SG.
XxLeprechaunxX::he does fit a 6th man role pretty well, but i dont think he would like that
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::like it or get traded
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Evans and Jimmer. As long as Evans stops shooting jumpers and MT shoots less I'm fine
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Ohio wins wow
XxLeprechaunxX::wow, what an impressive game too
dallasmavs258::lmao @ the wolves fan who said the wolves are one of the best teams in the NBA. 7 year playoffs drought counts for nothing it seems
crossovr11::Yeah and the kings have done SO much better!... bull $@%!.

Crazy Tatted Nuggets fan::if your looking for a cheap h.o try happyhappy joyjoys mom.  she is very cheap
