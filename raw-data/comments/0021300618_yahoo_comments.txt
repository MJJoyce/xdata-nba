doomshades::Rudy Gay has been quite an efficient scorer for the Kings. He significantly improved his FG percentage from 39% in Toronto to 51% in Sacramento.
sasquatch::Rudy made his uncle proud with tonight's performance.
Josh::Solid win. They didn't let the Pelicans build off the momentum they had heading into the half.  This team looks like it's starting to find it's identity.
Uan theTruth::As an analyst, I see Thornton was pretty worthless except he did play a little defense.  Acy was worthless except for the offensive rebounds.  Thomas still gets beat on defense almost every time.  I agree with the professor.  Not impressed with winning against one of the worst teams.
Professor::As a former coach now analyst of the NBA, SAC has not impressed me here.  Thomas still gets beat by whoever he defends and was 6 for 17 on offense.  The coach is oblivious to his problems.  Good game Gay.
Professor::Fredette is impressive the way he comes cold off the bench and can hit threes. His percentages and numbers look similar to Ray Allen.  He has looked great on defense this year as well.  As an analyst I would recommend giving him more chances.  It can't hurt.  We haven't seen much out of Thornton, Acy, or McLemore this year.
John::I wasn't impressed with our SAC guards,  Thomas was 6 for 17 and got beat consistently on defense.  Thornton and Acy have been worhtless on offense. However Fredette looked great on defense and great percentage coming cold off the bench.
jimmer jerk::Isaiah Thomas may get all the minutes but our hero Jimmer still makes more money.
JoshM::Fantasy question... Trade proposed to me. Anthony Davis (my player) for Lebron James(his player). What do you think? Thanks.
jimmer jerk::Look who decided to join in the conversation. Jimmer Jerk gdp pulling out the race card as usual.
