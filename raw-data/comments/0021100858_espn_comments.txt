yeahgodisgood2me::I found a betting system a few months back called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I discovered this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it. I am posting this for anyone that is looking for a system that actually works. There is a reason this system is all over Google as highly rated, it works
Blazelover13::Now, WHY didn't Philly do this to Toronto a week or so ago? So weird. Keep marching, Sixers. Even if you have to play the Heat in the first round, this time they'll be in for a surprise...
Kobe_in_my_team::Raptors, what a joke of a team    LOSERS FOREVER
hhkal::I said I'd check in...wow! Nice to see the Sixers take control in the 4th quarter but holy s*** at that Flyers game! Woo!!!!!!!!!!
bernotas22@yahoo.com::PE NIS
FIDEL CASTRO MY MAN::breaking news 49ers alex smith found dead  Thirty witnesses have been interviewed so far after the shooting death of Alex Smith, but there is no suspect...
arrogantespncommenter2::not funny
tank_dogg06::More Turner, Less Meeks plz k thx
DyersEve06::who the $@%! is alan anderson?
screwhead2305::philly is lucky to play in the East.. so many bad teams. good luck if yal can make the playoffs
Petro19::...and the sixers beat another bad team...yawn...Great wins for the Phils and Flyers!
pappydiving222::Hey, that's exactly what the Sixers need to close out the season with this cupcake schedule!
Petro19::it's not really going to matter - they're going to either play the Heat or the Bulls (if they make the playoffs at all) in the first round and get bounced.
pappydiving222::FLYERS WIN! PHILLIES WIN! SIXERS WIN!
jdp86::Yes!! Raptors inch closer to that lottery pick
bernotas22@yahoo.com::gonna draft another lithuanian
eessbb12::Idc if the sixers are beating up on bad teams, at this point any win is a good win. Also good to have Hawes back at such a crucial time.
bernotas22@yahoo.com::Linas Kleiza MVP
RememberTr00::Sixers blow
Ty21253::In 24 mins of garbage time turner gets 6-6-8 smh
Sour_BACK27::What a weak message board, anyway...........  WHY did Calderon only play 22 minutes?
Ty21253::FREE TURNER
bernotas22@yahoo.com::Linas kleiza is the best
LBJDWCBBIGTHREE1::You know what I just realized, when it's not a Heat board, there are so many less trolls, and you can actually have a conversation, that's nice.
phillysgreatest88::Good win Sixers!  At least one team can make us proud tonite!  Phillies are on their way too!
G0AT420::lol what a miracle on the 2h over..
LBJDWCBBIGTHREE1::Someone please tell me how the hell the Sixers bench is so much better than their starters.  It's freaking impressive
DaKing0325__::I don't know but it works
LBJDWCBBIGTHREE1::That it does
tah.adin::SIXERS = PLAYOFFS:)
DaKing0325__::Even tho its the raptors it's good to see philly finally realize how to play basketball again
mistersquare::Thanks for the effort Sixers.  I'm glad I took you guys instead of Indy.  WTH is going on with Indy?
23germany::craptors might get 66. at home
MirBay_Watson::I must admit, I am pleasantly surprised right now. Still dissappointed that it took THIS long for it to happen, but glad to see that the Sixers at least didn't quit on the season.
23germany::pls account for the fact they played CBA teams last couple days
MirBay_Watson::Good pass, Turner!  Hustler's Row is back. Good timing.
mistersquare::Elton Brand, just retire dude.
MirBay_Watson::You know what? I'm glad the Sixers finally decided to wake the hell up, but all this is for naught if they ended up with the #7 seed and have to face Miami.
DaKing0325__::The way I see is you'll have to face  Miami soon enough anyway

swami30::philly goes up 12 and wins by 3 u heard it here first
swami30::raptors +5 locked in
mistersquare::This looks like a fixed game in favor of Toronto.  Biggest trap game was BOSTON after that huge win in Miami yesterday.
swami30::50/50 u still got a good chance if philly presses the gas
mistersquare::Sixers -5
swami30::wut u got?
mistersquare::Wanna trade picks?
khop311::really need overtime so toronto hits the over
CubbieOccurence::This Vucevic guy is good.
MirBay_Watson::Yeah. Ticks you off that Collins went totally away from him AND Allen.
TimDuncangetting1forthethumb::If Philly doesnt score 30+ this quarter.....well......lets see what happens .....
MirBay_Watson::Good pass.
mistersquare::Thanks in advance for the tank job in the 4th quarter Sixers.  You guys should be ashamed of yourself!
MirBay_Watson::So, is this low scoring affair a good for bad thing?
TimDuncangetting1forthethumb::I will make a complaint with the FBI.
TimDuncangetting1forthethumb::Philly is fixing the game....I hope they get put in jail for this...Collins especially...
Nauldy00::TimDuncangetting1forthethumb - Philly is fixing the game....I hope they get put in jail for this...Collins especially...
ThaDard::Yea, the big bets are flowing in for Sixers Raptors
TimDuncangetting1forthethumb::Youre a fking joke, Phjilly.
PIDI9093::2 fukn points in last 5 minutes.  after opening with 13 points?  IT IS THE COACH!  WTF Collins?
TimDuncangetting1forthethumb::Philly...I hope you fking lose everything....
ThaDard::Seriously, Collins must have something against Turner. The leash seems tighter with every passing game
Ty21253::Free turner
Chuloflow::Lets  go TORONTO
