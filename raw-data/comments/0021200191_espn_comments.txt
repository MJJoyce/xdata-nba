WeAreTheMenInBlack::TP was $$$ as usual.  NEXT!  GO SPURS GO!!!!!
June 24th Is Kobe Bryant Day::Manu may be shooting like crud so far but he's still good for some amazing "Manu moments".  DeRozan is gonna hear about that one forever.
ImOldschool1964::That's why MANU is still VITAL to a possible SPURS championship run...he has always been a streaky shooter but he brings an intensity and an intangible that doesn't always show on the stat lines - he is a game changer, ie- he's a bada.ss!
Truth-Big Ticket-FedEx-Jet::Wow, 2-19? If I were a Raptors fan, I'd be pretty angry.
nba is the worst::Raptors fans complaining that Derozan's Wadeish flopping game wasn't rewarded enough are funny - he had a game-high 8 ftas, twice that of any Spurs starter.  It's obvious that the key was the 2-19 shooting of a Raptors player.  Hang in there folks, the wins will start coming soon!
Truth-Big Ticket-FedEx-Jet::No they won't.
nba is the worst::Raptors will get their share - There's a lot of crappy teams in the league.
Zeke Mansfield::Ughhhh Bargnani...34pts against Pistons then 2-19 yesterday???   Ed Davis. Ed Davis. Ed Davis.
epitome1986::so when did tim duncan have his bionic body implanted?
gstolls1967::I have made about  $3,000 a month  on average over the past 2 months now by following this betting system called Sportsbettingstar. When I found this site it was on the first page of Google when searching the words Sports Betting System. This system works. Hope this helps a bettor out there not having much luck.
1221Da::I've been following a system for betting lately called SportsbettingStar. In only two months time I have averaged $3,000 a month profit. I found this system on the first page of Google by searching the words Online Betting System.
Zippppppppp::That Bargnani stat line can't be real
YeahTerps420::lol
bwp2bruce::Please, that's a great stat compared to Odom's 1 point, 1 rebound, 1 assist performance aka the triple single
jj333s::Typical Spurs team grind the whole season and be right there at the end of the season Popovich gets it done year in year out, Go Spurs!
AustinBeal::Raptors fans shouldn't be blaming the refs for the loss. Raptors shot 36 percent while the Spurs shot 42 percent. That's why the Spurs won, so quit whining.
HiTekk_::Raptors finally draft a black guy! Its Terrence Ross!  Raptors' fan reaction : http://i.qkme.me/35u5dx.jpg
Fusiontron::Spurs need to blow out the Wiz.
bluekaze21::Duncan had 20 and 17 boards last game. 17. a few more of these kinds of production and im starting to call him optimus prime.
Vaquero In The House::The Raptors play a outstanding game, this was just an awesome win by Los Spurs!  Go Spurs Go!!
KyleFromWork::Bargnani 2-19 lol
BGSSGB::San Antonio Spurs, the New England Patriots, and Detroit Red Wings. Hats go off to y'all organizations. Simply amazing how you guys can just keep rolling year after year.
makar130::Bargnani???? Mago?????? i said, Fago...........stoopid italian rooster, without brains.... why Italy is now a third-rate team,  because team leaders are Bargnani and Gallinari ant they have not heard anything about teamwork basketball, Gallinari at least been playing defence.... Send him back to Rome, let this $@%! better  wash the Colosseum floor.....
SB4LlFE::didn't you craptors' fans say that your team is a playoff team during the summer?
wnsj89::ARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSS
DoctorBlast::What's with all the OT games lately. Is this a record?
TheJTram::Am I reading this right? Barg went 2-19? What happened? He was on fire when he was playing us
Heinrich.Himmler::he was a scrub this game
TorontoSportsDynasty::This is ridiculous Bargnani keeps sucking. Trade him.... he is half the Center Nowitizki is.
DoctorBlast::Considering that neither of them are centers, you're only half right.
TorontoSportsDynasty::2-19.......Bargnani wow
UNLVrebelsFan95::great game
CandySparker::Cheers San Antony Sparker!
Plargo::Once again, NBA refs show less than zero respect for DeRozan.  Dude was getting murdered all night on his way to the rim and gets noooooooo whistles  Bargnani had no business being on the floor in the last 4 minutes.
bgafferstany::i thought derozan actually got some calls today.  if he stopped whining im sure he d get more, or if his last name was bryant.  eatthatbutt??? you are one of those idiot haters.  34 points 2 nights ago.... he had a $@%!$@ night and his minutes were reduced.  we re the best worst team at least!
eatthatbutt::bargnani has no business being on the floor ever.  He is possibly the worst center i've ever seen, especially when you look at his contract.  4 points on 19 shots?
toronto-vigilante3::Bargnani had no business being on the floor in the last 4 minutes. ____________________________  Seems to be a common sentiment this season....  Raps have now blown 6 games late this season....and counting.
JoeyDorsey4MVP::you can even consider our two point win over Indiana a blown lead as well
manoocena::Blaming the refs is not going to solve your problems, they were numerous calls on the Spurs that were not called. There's a reason your team is 3-11 and it certainly is not just refs, that might turn 1 or 2 games but doesn't justify the other 9.  Once again Tony Parker closes, if this was Kobe or Lebron they'd show this in ESPN 100 times.
ImOldschool1964::Ok, we get it, you work for ESPN...thanks for the clarification,,,lol
neverzero::a lot of times the monthly fees break down to less than four dollars a month (just checked it's only 3.33 a month for me anyway)... Be hard pressed to get a good salad for only 3.33.
bgafferstany::hahah i laugh at every comment made by an "insider".  monthly fees would be better spent on a salad....
ImOldschool1964::If Kobe or Lebron had a performance like Parker's, ESPN's s.emen would be all over the front page of ESPN.
eatthatbutt::lebron wouldn't take 27 shots to get 32 points.  Kobe might though.  Either way, they'd be all over sportscenter.  I wouldn't call it closing though.
Tiagoooo::Exactly. And Spurs actually got hacked on back to back plays in 1OT (Duncan and Green).  They simply were letting them play out there.
toronto-vigilante3::@raptorsrepublic Oh you needed an update? My bad, thought you assumed. Raps lose. ________________________  Hhahahahaha...well done!
toronto-vigilante3::Refs need to start getting calls right Derozan gets hit way to much in the paint. _____________________________________  You know, the Raps established going to the hole early, and they got the calls, yet late in the game, that changed...and it changed for the Spurs too.  I don't know how the refs are calling these games anymore.
976Daniel::why do the raptors suck
Borderlands 2 sucks::Craptors: inventing ways to lose since 1996
Phatepiclewts::17 offensive rebounds isn't going to save you from 36% shooting.  Raptors should have gotten some good shooters in the offseason. Instead, they acquired Landry 'the Brick' Fields.
8486Chase::Who's gonna win Arena bowl XXVI
8486Chase::Who is gonna win Arena Bowl XXVI
8486Chase::Bargiani for MVP! LOL
kagannagak::raps need to fire casey. Every game we come up losing by one or two baskets or in overtime. He isnt calling the right plays.
.NYC IS THE BEST 68::Casey is nice
jays hit moonshots::colangelo needs to go he's not bringing in the right players   whats casey supposed to do when colangelas big contract guys(derozan bargnani) shoot 13/47
.NYC IS THE BEST 68::take out derozan he had a nice game
tnfins::way to pull out a hard fought victory spurs.  Pound the Rock baby!   Now back to my regularly scheduled NFL Sunday, including a win for my dolphins
tnfins::Same to you bro.  Hopefully our Fins can start to resemble our Spurs!  Fins Up!  Go Spurs Go!
skytheguy21::hey another spurs/dolphins fan, you got good taste
.NYC IS THE BEST 68::Dolphins won
.NYC IS THE BEST 68::Refs need to start getting calls right Derozan gets hit way to much in the paint.
Dan0934::Bargnani SMH!!!
Deven3091::Raptors suck, but they played the Spurs very well. I'd give them an A.
.NYC IS THE BEST 68::Bargnani 2-19 not a good sign after a 34 point game only if he was consistant raps will be scary good Derozan and Lowry both are consistant, valancianous still gets his double double. Bargnani needs to step up for raptors to win. now there going on a 7 road trip the need to win at least 3 of those games.
supe540::Bargnani with a game for the ages.
Pedro5371::i just seen bargiani 2-17 and literally started pissing my pants of laughter at how pathetic my city team is lollll
robdiaz2191::splitter needs to get more involved
LakerHeadsReckoning211::Tony Parker sure has turned his season around these last 3 games!
MetsoooNLoooChampsooo2012::Bargs almost single handedly ruined my +7.5
TheFeedMachine::Bargs is in full on tank mode I see.
Td4mvp3::rapts showed me alot today...that young team is only gonna get better
8486Chase::Jk, I'm still here
