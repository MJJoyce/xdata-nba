Geotheleo::I'm going to like the Bulls' new guard, Augustin. Once he gets his basketball feet under him he's will return the speed back into the Bulls lineup.
Cyril::Larry Drew finally realized it was stupid to not play John Henson starter's minutes.  Now, how long will it take before he realizes the same thing about Antetokounmpo?  The smart thing for the Bucks would be to find a gullible GM who would take OJ Mayo off their hands, and then just play the young guys all the minutes they can handle.
