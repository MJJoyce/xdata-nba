ray::is denver that good of team anymore?  I haven't watched them in a couple years.  they looked bad...  just cause there was no flow to their offensive game.  I would like to give the jazz defense credit for part of that.  but I don't think the jazz has very good defense.  I thought it was over for the jazz when they didn't score a field goal for like 8 minutes in the 3rd quarter.  but either denver got lax on the defense or the jazz figured a way to work around it and score.
PKM::Utah +500 sounds juicy, they are finally healthy and Lawson might be rusty.
Anton::Jazz are not tanking properly...
James::Utah is better than their record, and Denver isn't as good as theirs. Denver got outplayed on both ends by a team who has nothing to lose.
Dan::Haha, Denver gets drubbed at home by one of the worst teams in the NBA and the Broncos lost to the SuperChargers at home on Thursday Night. Where are you "Anonymous?" LOL!
Steve Moore::Someone told Denver about how good the draft is going to be and this is the result. Jazz folks  don't get your undies in a bunch, everyone's tanking to take your place in draft
Delmarco Boyland::How valuable is ty lawson
landshark::#$%$.... DENVER WAKE THE F UP.... NBA FIX IN AGAIN...... ALL IT TAKES IS 1 PG 1 REF... PAYDAY!
ray::denver is playing really bad.  jazz should feel very lucky to be ahead against them.  I hope they (the jazz) realize at halftime they better make some improvements or they will lose.
Curtis::The Jazz will win 30 to 35 games this season, as long as the fab five (Kanter, Favors, Alex, Gordon and TB) stay healthy, which is a lot more than the 15 games I thought they were going to win this season. I base this off of Phoenix which has a winning record and based off the rosters, the Jazz roster is better than Phoenix.
