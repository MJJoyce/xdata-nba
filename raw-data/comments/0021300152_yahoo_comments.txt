GC::this looks like a positive sign for Denver. as usual there is no superstar or even a system that was adapted by George Karl, but the paint and rebounding game is still there. less 3's or jump shots and more paint pts by Hickson and Mozgov and attacking the rim by all, then maybe an 8th seed or even 7th. but when you look at the west, it is really hard to even put Denver in top 10, i hope we get a playoff spot. GO DEN!!  good comeback by OKC.
Person Dude::Westbrook is the most mercurial player in the NBA. Sometimes you absolutely hate him for his ballhogging ways and when Russell Westbrick shows up instead, but other times you love him when he goes off and has a monster game. That and the fact that OKC needs him.
DaveM::Denver shot 52 percent from the line, missed like 17 free throws, and lost by only 2, so there's no real excuse to losing this game. Hit your damn free throws. However, Ibaka had Mozgov wrapped up like he was performing a form tackle in the NFL on that last inbounds pass and no foul was called. Tough loss but valiant effort from a team in a rebuilding process. Denver should be kicking itself for not going after Dwight Howard if they were intent on building a 1/2-court team. Denver needs a few more pieces to get back into "contender" status.
bluuzman::What is Durant's low fat game this year? He's averaging over 12 fat every game and had 16 tonight. And he still had 27 fga that actually counted.
Brendon::Jeremy Lamb looks like he's pretty useless.
clint::make the free throws you win the game Denver.
Nawmy DB::Nuggets missed 18 free throws; must have attended Howard-O'Neal school of free throw shooting.
PKM::Unfortunate fourth quarter for the Nuggets.
Anton::In OKC home, Durant always gets minumum 10 to 15 freethrows thanks to refs.
chuck d::Not playing a true center really working well for OC; Hickson looks like a superstar
