knowlto::Ahh, I see Stuckey and Knight are sucking balls again...
houz537300::no CP3,no win
roger_z0::Clippers need a new coach, it solved NY problem
leeboljm13::You've got that right.
spyderx2::The drek of NBA.  OT needed to score 87 &amp; 83 points.
Tebow Hater::The Clippers are doing what the Knicks were supposed to be doing for a while now: consistently playing well over .500 basketball. There's something about playing in NY that makes players suck. Ask the Islanders, Jets, Mets, Knicks, etc. they always have good players and always suck.
TheFinalPlay::another 4th quarter Choke? This teams plays like Lebron.
Gofmanator::Screw the clippers. I had detroit +6.5 for the second half and the clippers out scored them by seven. I must have the luck of the polish
lilgetz36::Chris Paul is the best, Blake Griffin is #2
sethbball20::The Pistons are so close right now, it's not even funny. I could see them being like this year's Clippers team. They are 1 big piece away from being a contender.
NBA_refs_are_weak::a CONTENDER? for what?
LAndofTroyfan2::Ralph Lawler is the worst play by play commentator, EVER!!
leeboljm13::Lawler's okay but Smith has got to go
1Realthing::I'm still not sure why laker "fans" troll clippers comment pages, but I am sure that you are a tool!
Mountainrockis67::I've been following a betting system called sportsbettingstar for a few months now. I have made over 3K a month for two consecutive months since I started playing this system. If you google "sports betting system" you will find the system on the first page of Google. It is the best system I have tried in many years of betting
yorkalldayy::the real big 3? scalibrine luke walton and kwame brown http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/p/best-nba-memes.html
Soonerhopeful1::Are the Clippers good enough to come back from  10 points down in 4th with 5 minutes to play, or was it luck..?
MKG_Floater::It was Chris Paul

gt1master_ike::Game on the line, CP3 wants the ball  Yea he has some blunders in late situations  but the dude has won games for the clips they would have lost last year.
CandySparker::Paul Lotta Love!
drmcfunk::Vinnie has to go,
ratso1::keep chuckin
bmccor08::preposterous 9 games in 12 days" - seriously? these guys are professional athletes?
tatashady::Chris Paul is a cheating little $@%!$.  I hope someone takes him out.
esfahany::Hes got a chip....
esfahany::Clippers aren't looking good as of late.....they lost their urgency......
bryan36492::2nd best player
t casey::They lost their 3rd best player, Chauncey Billups. They won't be the same team without him unless they replace him with someone of equal value.
esfahany::Let see...........Mo, Joe and Curly..............OK.........Put Mo in as his replacement.....
esfahany::Good for Lakers...
ratso1::easy over
dabulls2012::What's the Clips record since they lost Chauncey?
pioms::Not to make excuses, but the schedule has been brutal... A lot of it has to do with lack of energy. Lot of the guys out there look a step slower than they did a month ago.   I know everyone plays the same effed up schedule, but they were getting a lot of deflections, steals and blocked shots that were leading to fast break points. That's pretty much gone at this point.   Been playing a lot of slow halfcourt offense.
dabulls2012::12-12...interesting...
ratso1::only 40 needed in fourth for over, lol
ratso1::defensive powerhouses
ratso1::can someone please launch a DNS attack against fade the bookie
shivyjr::and lightspeed1000
LightSpeed1000::youre mad?
LightSpeed1000::rondo dishes out 15 assists in his sleep. CP3 is overrated as f_)__
jdrman2007::lol rondo couldnt shoot sand if he stood on a beach with a cannon.
MKG_Floater::CP3 scores 19 in his sleep. Rondo struggles to get 10.
pete23nba81::CP3 controls the game better than Rondo. And unlike Rondo, Paul can actually shoot.
shivyjr::rondo also has better players your point
dabulls2012::What do the Clips have to do this year in the playoffs in order for Vinny to remain the coach next season? As a Bulls fan that watched this knucklehead eek out two .500 seasons with much better talent than those results, I couldn't wait for the Bulls to let him go...I was STUNNED when the Clips hired him right away...now that they have a real team and a legit shot at doing some damage in the playoffs, what's it going to take for him to stay?
shivyjr::garnett is good ray allen is still good paul pierce and that all i got
LightSpeed1000::better players? blake griffin and deandre jordan are better than everyone on the celtics. its not 2007 anymore, you f**king loser.
fliptide...::what "better players?"  45 yr old Garnett?  Clippers NEED A Real Coach
fliptide...::TWO "Why the Hell"  1. Why the hell did the Clippers need OVERTIME to beat ....the Detroit Pistons?  2. Why the hell did they only score 89 points??
1Realthing::Didn't the lakers lose to detroit?
shivyjr::cause they were cold shooting the ball
shivyjr::George Uchiha had ex parents who were clipper fans who put him in foster home because they were tired of his stupid a.ss and he probably stayed their till he was 18 and now he was lucky enough to get a job at mcdonalds and has an crap apartment in the middle of the ghetto i get it now
