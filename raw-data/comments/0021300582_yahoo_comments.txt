Beatle::It looks like Orlando has a whole team of players who would be good backups for almost any other NBA team. It's amazing that almost every game is not a blowout and they have actually won a few games. At least it shows they are trying and that's about the best they can do.
Dave H::Jordan should look at a trade for some veteran help!. One good proven sharpshooter, and a Big center to help Big Al. Go Bobcats!
Nolefann::If Orlando thinks the draft is going to help them, they are in for a rude awakening. Should have used that 17 mil trade exception on help instead of letting it expire for nothing in return.
Justin::big al always dominates orlando
donald::Not sure why McBob feels the need to shoot 3 three-pointers a night, but for tonight at least, it's working.
Amir::Is Big Al going to hit All stars game or they send Noah again?
Vataughn::I swear we can't hold a good lead.
cjk::Way to go Big Z keep it up!
Mario::I would think the - 24 next to Nelson's name might give this coach a clue
Dave H::Would love for them to get Omer Asik some how! would be good  !  just sayin! looking to get better in the paint
