wcmcgeeiii::I liked Coach Smart coming in, as he had a good attitude and seemed to know where to take the team. Now he is looking like Westphal with constantly changing rotations and playing time. At this point, play the young guys and let them work together for the future. This season is all but lost anyway. And maybe stand up for the players and take the T. That is what a good coach would do when his star is looking like he is going the wrong direction with the refs.
kapernick is squidward::the name keith smart is an oxymoron
youngndumb7::I am happy that Seattle will be getting a team back, but it is unfortunate that its this team.  I would take Isaiah Thomas only, and hold an open tryout in Seattle to fill out the roster.
dog_has_fleas::Wait until the sale is final brother, I remember when the deal was "done" for the arena. Things change all the time and Stern clearly wants the franchise in SacTown.

ryensgin::The majority of Jazz fans that post on here amaze me.  What ridiculousness and thank heavens that none of us are in a position to make decisions for the Jazz.  So much blindness and negativity it's disgusting especially for a competitvie team with a WINNING record and in playoff position.  Honestly if you are real Jazz fans, when is the last time Utah EVER made a big trade during the season, involving core players??  The biggest in season trade in franchise history probably was Kyle Korver.  The only other big trade I can remember was Ronnie seikley in 97 and he refused to come play for us.  Yet you demand that we trade big al who does so many good things for us.    Do you not realize that the Jazz were down 77-71 when Corbin put Millsap and Jefferson back in.  From that point we outscored the Kings 27-14 and won the game.  Since 2008 Al leads all centers in points and rebounding averages, yet you wonder why Corbin plays him?????  Unbelievable.  http://yfrog.com/ob13kmzj.    Corbin has done a excellent job in his first REAL season with a team that has not played together hardly at all.  We are a playoff team, yet all you can think if is to whine.  Relax, I really doubt that we will sign Al to a deal in the offseason, so you will probably finally get your wish, to see favors and kanter get starters minutes NEXT season, but until then, can't you just enjoy this season without all the negativity???
2noodlekaboodle::I agree with everything your saying ryensgin. Except the biggest midseason trade the Jazz have made has to be D-Will for Favors/Harris/Picks.
JPHoks1981::5 games over 500 in the west without our starting PG and Hayward out the last 5 games. Yeah I have no problem with that. Corbin is doing a great job in my mind
JPHoks1981::I also agree with everything you said ryensgin nicely done.
scow79::Keep drinking the kool-aid brother!!   Empty stats are great!!  I'd also contend that if we did have one of the best front courts in the NBA, then we wouldn't be getting routinely out rebounded every game by the opposing team and wouldn't be 23rd in defense right now.  No team Big Al has been on has ever cracked the top 20 barrier in defense and no  team that Big Al is on ever will.
dewdude9000::I agree with just about everything you said.  I love that Al can score, but I also hate that he lets other centers and smaller guys score in the paint as much as he does.  The effort is all I would want from him sometimes, but sometimes you don't even get that.  With Favors or Kanter they are at least giving a 110% play after play because they want to get more time.  I wouldn't mind if they don't make any moves because we definitely have one of the best backcourts in the NBA.  The one reason I would like to see a move is that it doesn't help when you have probably your third best player coming off the bench. (talking about Favors)
ryensgin::I agree 100% effort is all you can ask for or expect
landcplus6::I am enjoying the season and some of the good things Al does on offense.  However, you have to admit that he is a huge liability on the defensive end.  Yes, he scores 16-20 pts a game, but he probably gives up 18-22 a game due to his pathetic defense.  Right now (last 10 games) with less than 25 min/game, Favors is averaging 11 pts/game but plays terrific defense.  Give him more time and the overall benefit to the team would be much better than having Al in there.
landcplus6::I hear what you're saying ryensgin. I am happy with what they've accomplished and I've been pleased that Al has done a much better job of passing this year as opposed to last year.  Frankly, I never had any expectations for Al to be a good defender.  I just see an opportunity for the Jazz to improve over the long run by getting Favors more minutes.  Al gets us maybe a couple of additional wins the rest of this year, but playing Favors more the rest of this year (which will only happen if Al is traded) has the potential to get us many more wins next year or the year after.  Limiting Favors minutes by not trading Al will reduce potential wins in the future by slowing his development.
ryensgin::Yes I agree al is a bad defender.  But why do people have high expectations for him on D?  He's never been a defender.    No player is perfect, you have to enjoy the good a player brings and deal with the bad sometimes.  I think the Jazz with big Al have greatly exceeded expectations as a team.  We were supposed to be bottom feeders after Sloan remember?  That say, I don't think he is the future of our franchise.  He was a quick fix for losing boozer and I'm happy with what we've accomplished in his time here.  Kanter and favors will get their minutes next season.  Remember both of them aren't backing up big al though.  One backs up millsap...
danjorams::I don't believe you want John Salmons taking your last 2 three point shots in overtime to get back into it.  his offensive game is just horrible. and thortons isn't much better as both are just black holes for the basketball.  glad to see they getr 36 and 26 minutes respectively with those awesome shooting numbers.
dog_has_fleas::The best part of the top of this forum, none of the first dozen posts or so mention Jimmer.
danjorams::but now you just did.  can't stop thinking about him can you.
laynestaleys05::All the sudden I'm a HUGE Kings fan  - Seattle
NYeltigre::WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PISSED IF UTAH LOST
TAC0REV::Burks &gt; Tinsley and Watson combined. Any intelligent franchise wouldn't put either of those useless hacks onto the court ever again.
Darkflame07::Burks is better offensively but he hit jumpshots tonight that he usually struggles with. I would like to see burks get more minutes at the backup pg but I still don't think that he is the future pg of this team, it's just not his strength.
NYeltigre::Burks played well tonight but struggles at PG most times. I loved watching him get time though
watchDreplay::why are the kings keeping cousins obviously he doesnt like playing for them.
quazzychicken::the kings are keeping him because they cant move anybody while in the middle of new owner mess they arent a team intill a new owner is named wether its sac or seattle
max5616::You have to stop farting blood
ensign.devyn::If I was doing that, I would absolute agree with you, as that'd be horrific

LaurasFiance::Hey everyone, I know that most people are on here talking sports, but was wondering if any of you had 30 seconds to get on Facebook and like a picture for my cousin Melissa. She has a chance to win free braces if she gets the most "likes". It would really be great if you could "LIKE" her photo. Here is the URL.

bills4XAFC::Kings Suck!
rush717::WOW...That's insightful........
scow79::https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BCUUQ95CMAAzr_o.jpg:large  Philly gets Will Smith at their game, Utah gets Carlton.   Sounds about right.
NYeltigre::is he really a jazz fan?
Darkflame07::I don't get cousins. Seriously how stupid do you have to be to not realize you could be an allstar if you would just shut your mouth. What an epic waste of talent.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.
free derrick favors::Carlton from the fresh prince of bel air was at the game. looool
free derrick favors::probably cause the sundance film festival
NYeltigre::its over im pretty sure and has been for about a week
rbmw263::Carlton and Antione Walker apparently go to Jazz games.  So random
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::If I was a head coach, my big men would be required to watch one hour of film of Dennis Rodman playing every day.
Boneshank::If I was the head coach of the Jazz, my first call would be to Malone to come be a big-man coach.  Say what you will about him, the Mailman brought it each &amp; every night out.
Boneshank::But tell me that wouldn't scare the bejeezus out of the guys, seeing a 50yr-old Malone walking into practice everyday, still ripped &amp; in better shape than any of the guys 30 years younger.  Just don't let him coach them about anything outside of basketball or conditioning...
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Kawl Malone gonna do what Kawl Malone gonna do. Hawdees!
mikeisildur::I feel like that might have some unintended consequences..
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Totally worth it.
Boneshank::LMAO.
rbmw263::there is literally zero chance the Jazz trade Big Al unless someone comes offering something absurd for him.  which isnt going to happen
vergatease::scow knows what he is talking about.
TRSling::I like favors, but he isn't nearly as good as Jazz fans think he is. He was rate 30th in players under 25 years old on ESPN. The Jazz offense needs a player that can demand double teams to open up the offense for other players and that isn't Favors - it may never be. Al is a phenomenal low post player and he has really improved his passing. He should be playing along side  Favors to make up for his defense. Milsap is the odd man out.
scow79::Well if ESPN said so, then who are we to argue?  If they tell me something about the LA Lakers then I'll believe it since they're basically riding the Lakers' t.aint every night.  ESPN knows very little about the Utah Jazz so their evaluation of Derrick Favors means jack s.hit to me.
rbmw263::Favors will never be as good as Big Al in the post but he has the potential to be better in basically every other part of the game.  Namely, defense.  Cutting/rolling to the basket etc
scow79::Easily 20 points a game.   Favors has never ran the PnR with a PG who has the skill set to run the PnR.   Shumpert sucked.  Mo Williams and Devin Harris are terrible at it.  Tinsley?   Please.
Boneshank::mikeisildur "I disagree with that assessment. No matter how hard Jeremy Evans works, he will never be Lebron James. So much of it is just genetics and sheer god-given talent. Otherwise anyone could be in the NBA."  I agree, but you're not picking a superior physical specimen of a prospect to compare to the target player.  LeBron James is superior to Evans physically, not just in all the other qualities that make someone great. James is starting out with a winning DNA-lottery ticket already.  This is not the case when comparing the prospect Favors to the target Jefferson -- Favors is already the superior physical talent. Now he just has to utilize it &amp; put the pieces together to surpass Jefferson in virtually every way.  Of course, Corbin needs to realize this too, which would help get the ball rolling.
rbmw263::Exactly.  Burks/Hayward/Favors PnR like its going out of style.  Can you imagine D Will and Favors in the pick and roll? Favors would be averaging 20 per game
scow79::I don't care if Favors has better footwork than Big Al or not.  I do care that the Jazz develop Favors as a PnR player, which is what he should be with some post play thrown in.  If you think Favors is anything like Big Al, then you're an idiot.
mikeisildur::I disagree with that assessment.  No matter how hard Jeremy Evans works, he will never be Lebron James.  So much of it is just genetics and sheer god-given talent.  Otherwise anyone could be in the NBA.
rbmw263::Big al has the best back to the basket game in the league IMO.  Favors can develop a solid post game for sure, just not the best
Boneshank::Was gonna say Adams, but okay, let's go with Finley.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::And who says he won't? It's up to Favors how good he gets. People seem to forget that work ethic determines how good a player gets. Michael Jordan with Al Jefferson's work ethic is Michael Finley.
lester4586::favors is a good physical player who can rebound and dunk but his offense will never be as good as big al kanter is just 6 fouls on any other team he is just big no talent and thats why the jazz will stay where they are those are the player they want wouldnt even make the playoffs without big al
rbmw263::No talent? cmon man.  He is 20 years old, been playing ball for like 4 years and is already better than half of the league.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Ha. That's why I said "arguments."
Boneshank::"favors is a good physical player who can rebound and dunk but" ... See, you started off okay, but then just lost all credibility when you started spewing uninformed opinion as fact.  Perhaps the Jazz wouldn't make the playoffs this year without Jefferson. Maybe not even next year.  But I (and I believe many other Jazz fans) would be totally fine with that, if it meant we actually developed the youngsters to see what they were capable of.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::LOL. I love the "arguments."
lester4586::big al is leaving after this season and the idiot jazz fans will have what they want heyward, kanter, millsaps, and whoever else none of those players can score none get double team big al can and does foye wide open three because of al
Boneshank::Hey lester4586, let's play a game then.  You pretend that you're Jefferson, and this forum is the Jazz, and the end of the season is right now.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Well since Derrick Favors is the ripe of of 21, I'd be willing to wager his game develops more than it currently is at.
mikeisildur::What's annoying is they brought him in specifically to augment Deron Williams, then immediately traded Deron Williams.  Great.
rbmw263::Traded Deron Williams for guys they apparently plan on letting rot on the bench
scow79::One can dream....
scow79::Please don't say that.   If they re-sign Big Al then I just might hand in my Jazz fandom card.
rbmw263::Might as well dream about Jeremy Evans starting..  Our FO has a boner for Al
rbmw263::Im going to sue the Jazz for robbing me of the glory that is Derrick Favors.  24 minutes.  what a joke.
rbmw263::He's so much fun to watch.  AND....get this...he plays defense
Boneshank::I thought that end of the court was where Frankenjefferstein simply caught his breath so he'd be ready to do seven pumpfakes &amp; a push shot on the other end?  You mean he's misleading us???
rbmw263::I know right.  Apparently, its half of the game.  Whoda thunkit.
scow79::Is that what that is called?   I've forgotten what that is after watching Big Al for the last 3 years.
free derrick favors::<sub></sub>
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Watch the last 12 seconds of regulation whilst listening to this.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-H-MWJ4f14#t=02m05s
mikeisildur::Yeah I found that, now find me the last 12 seconds of regulation
R Barron::Do it  http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=b6lruok
2noodlekaboodle::Your biggest hold up is Garnett has a No Trade Clause in his contract. I don't think he would want to go to LA. Boston would have to blow their team up first, then try this trade, KG is too loyal to Pierce and Doc Rivers to leave otherwise. Also, if your the Clipps, and have Bledsoe for next season, and CP3 isn't signed, why would you trade him until you know you have CP3 locked up for next year?
Wombat1247::YEP - SOUNDS GOOD TO ME
scow79::I could actually see that one maybe working.   I've heard Boston has some interest in Big Al.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Agree to a buyout with Odom, then see what Bledsoe can do. If he sucks, it's only costing $1.7 through next year.
nashjam::Nothing is more Utah than the sounds of John Coltrane and Miles Davis....and The Osmonds
mikeisildur::Wasn't ensign.devyn at this game?  Need to ask him what it was like to have the hilarity unfold right before him.
ensign.devyn::Hey man, it was so funny. I was one of the ones jeering him out of the arena. I love watching Cousins live, because you know you'll get to see some great basketball, and some of the funniest reactions, tantrums, and in this case, throwouts ever.
Derelictmy::Stop playing with your jimmer!
scow79::When asked about the last possession where Al’s three was a tad short, Tyron Corbin: “It was a good shot.”  Boy do we have a genius running this team or what?
rbmw263::Guarantee he was sarcastic.  I hope?
scow79::No, he wasn't.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Is that for reelz?
scow79::Yeah.  tribjazz even commented on it to your right &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
mikeisildur::It was like 3 feet short.  And EVERYONE saw it coming.  That's why I burst into uncontrollable laughter and probably disturbed my neighbors.  WHY, Ty, WHY?
UNTisPathetic::Try having Smart
UNTisPathetic::I'd like to apolgize for using the N word earlier on this board.  While it was wrong to say, I must admit I feel alot better.  Once again my apologies.
jason21382::At least Utah won, and Jimmer's team lost. Good game.
scow79::http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1283828/Tyset_medium.png  Guys, I found Corbin's clipboard from last season.   It looks eerily similar to this season.
Boneshank::Looks like a sketch of someone's junk hanging out from below a t-shirt.   I guess when your coaching ability sucks balls as much as Corbin's does, it's bound to show up on the clipboard eventually.
jf20219::Looks complicated
michael107117::The NBA needs to vote on the Kings sale at the All star break, not in April.
UNTisPathetic::See you guys later-  btw im a gay black.
TheMightyShadow::Was pulling my hair out watching the Jazz go to Jefferson over and over down the stretch, when it was clear to anybody with eyes that he had nothing going on against Hayes.  Painful  to watch.
jason21382::Time to make some trading moves Bring someone big time to the Jazz.
lester4586::some of your fans are ignorant saying trade big al the jazz have lots of talent that can compliment each other and win the coaching is the problem millsaps needs big al look at his numbers since big al and they also need a point guard
ensign.devyn::Hey, trade Big Al.
lester4586::utah is no place stars want to go and play and their fans are idiots
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Another ignorant blanket statement. Don't be a troll. The game is over. You wanna have an actual conversation, then we're all for that.
lester4586::nobody want to go to utah after the trade and their contract is up they will leave
Boneshank::Unfortunately for the Jazz, you're not far off the truth.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::I wouldn't go as far as to make that blanket statement, but as a whole, yes, free agency is not the way Utah will build a winner.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::Well that's not going to happen, but some moves do need to be made.
mikeisildur::I'm sorry, I could not stop laughing at the Jazz's last play of regulation. It was just basically the Jazz's coaching/starting lineup situation for the whole season, perfectly summarized in 12 seconds of tragic comedy.
TremorsIsTheGreatestMovieEver::If only it had been set to the music of Pagliacci.

RickyWolfioGOAT::CHARGERS ARE DONE FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS
R Barron::I'd trade Jefferson for a first rounder and a backup pg at this point. Hoping for Bledsoe though
lester4586::you are right he is no good and the jazz will get stars to come play there oh i forgot the jazz have kanter he is a better center
lester4586::he is better than anyone on utah team and it is not even close maybe the jazz mgmt see that too and i hope he leaves because i like him but not utah utah suck thats why they cant win people want gordon heyward to be a star not even close neither is millsaps
Boneshank::Wow okay. You've got some issues.  I misunderstood &amp; thought you might be engaging in a sensible basketball discussion.  I didn't know you were six, though. Sorry. Carry on.
lester4586::jefferson leads the team in points rebounds and blocks maybe trading woill be good because he is a free agent and should leave hopless utah
Boneshank::And Jazz management, if they were even halfway intelligent, should be trumpeting this fact to the rest of the league's GMs in hopes of unloading the Jefferson albatross.
dkgoode::Jefferson is the most consistent player the Jazz have right now. Jazz just need to keep playing Burks at PG n they wont need another backup.
dkgoode::Jefferson is the most consistent player the Jazz have right now. Jazz just need to keep playing Burks at PG n they wont need another backup.
Boneshank::Consistent, yes.  He is very consistent in taking 17 or so shots to score 15 or so points, while consistently soaking up 38 or so minutes every game, consistently leaving Favors or Kanter glued to the pine so they can consistently not learn &amp; improve.
Boneshank::I'd trade Jefferson for a washing machine right now.
Boneshank::Well then, maybe one of those old folding chairs that Yi Jianlian was working out against back in the day are still kicking around.  They played defense equivalent to Jefferson.
scow79::A washing machine is not fair value.   It would actually move in the paint on defense and could box out.
Boneshank::I didn't say it had to work.
scow79::I was going to go lower and say a box of crackerjacks
R Barron::I'd rather have Kanter and Favors get more minutes

lester4586::millsaps is better thats why al leads the team in everything but millsaps will be the one the jazz keeps because noone else wants him
King of the Echo People::Don't pay Jefferson, trade him. Millsap is the one to keep between the two.
Boneshank::Exactly.  Millsap plays hard. Sure, he's undersized for PF, in stature. But not in effort.  He comes up big quite often, in big time moments.  Plus his versatility allows him to play with either Kanter, or Favors, or both.   Kick Jefferson to the curb, wearing Corbin as the boot.
A Country Boy Can Survive::Tyrone Corbin should be fired
