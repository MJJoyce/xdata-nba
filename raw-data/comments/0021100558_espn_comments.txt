Elton Brand::I am the greatest power forward in nba history.
higginbombers::You are not Elton brand plus I don't even like Elton brand Kevin love is one trillion times better
14lbenson::GO BUCKS GO!!!!
mmostello::WOW! Great effort Sixers. I get losing to Chicago, but the Bucks? Evan Turner and Jrue Holiday went 5-25 combined! The Sixers are up to their old lazy tricks from last year; not bringing their "A", "B", or even "C" games vs. a 4th class team. Weak.
cyclonextrem::Bucks beat the heat twice and the Lakers all in a week...
cyclonextrem::Bucks are better than you think
BadgersPackersBrewersBucksWarhawks::bucks are dangerous
OptimusPrime4.0::Wow the sixers are inconsistent like crazy
mmostello::True!
Malcyon1::Ersan = the next Kevin Love.
higginbombers::Tubby is a tubby. Ersan is the next Kevin love
TubbyTime334::No One = The Next K-LOVE
truesportfanman::The mustard's off the hot-dog for the sixers.
12356816323::anyone else think brandon jennings is incredibly underrated?
BadgersPackersBrewersBucksWarhawks::you mean overrated?
-FEARTHEDEER-::Anyone like this trade? Beno and SJax for Wesley Matthews?
BadgersPackersBrewersBucksWarhawks::Sjax for anyone would be great he is a bd influence on brandon
chazzzzz1965::Another close game another loss what a shame
GeorgetownDCman::When did James Franco become a rebounding beast?
Celtics17Banners::Time for Boston to take over 1st where they belong. Home sweet Home.
jman_5000::Lol remember when people thought the sixers were contenders?
Sixers1234567::Evan Turner seriously pi$$es me the hell off.  He can't make a jump shot to save his life and his percentages are just terrible across the board. (fg, 3pt, and ft%)... We benched Jodie Meeks and started Turner at SG for the 1st time this year and he responds with 1-12 FG. I would rather have Meeks starting cuz he atleast can make 3's. Turner is good for nothing.  I say we trade him for Chris Kaman, cuz Hawes is never healthy and we have 6'8' Elton Brand playing center most the game.
korn7860::Good win for the Bucks, hopefully they can get a few more in the next few weeks, Bogut should be back before April, which will be a pleasant site, especially if we only 2-4 games behind the 8 seed yet.  Not saying I want to be the 8 seed, but considering the issues with Sjax, and all the injuries, I would accept it.
korn7860::Also to note above comment, Bucks are pursuing Crawford among others, maybe a deal like that can give them the boost they need similar to 09, plus we have the exact same wins this many games in as 09 and we finished 46-36 (31-13 from this game on in 09)  I think they can make a similar run this year, and have the schedule to help them do it if healthy and a player like Crawford is acquired.
korn7860::ya, one of the issues I have with Skiles, Jennings rocked the first quarter, 19 points.  Then Skiles sits him until the 6 min mark in the second.  WHAT, 6 minutes of rest for a 22 year old, he should not have gotten rest until he cooled off, he was still steaming at the end of the first.
Purple Drank 631::That's what I really came here for, I heard Jennings was ballin in thee 1st half, so he ended up with 33 points? Not bad.
Purple Drank 631::It's funny every board I go on, there is a Heat fan, or at least somebody talking about the Heat. I'm glad they're a contenders now and should be for a couple years to come, hopefully some rings come with all this joining together.
higginbombers::Ok so I was at the game and this bulls fan all of a sudden screams LETS GO GIANTS he got thrown out
JimboSliceLv42::who likes the heat here? someone brought them up so had to finish the little heat talk about OKC killing them in the finals this year
Frank Reynolds 6::Some of the bulls fans are in denial
Frank Reynolds 6::I don't like them but come on people have to realize they are above and beyond the best team in the east
Rick-Da-Villain::The heat ain't s.hit..they can be beaten like anyone else ...get off their d.icks...@frank Reynolds
JimboSliceLv42::nah heats big 3 is to much for the bulls they are gunna roll over them like last year
sumbrownkid::Roll over?  Those games were close as hell.
JimboSliceLv42::whos gunna beat the heat in the east? bulls are the closest team and they dont really have a shot.
Frank Reynolds 6::What they do win a game against them last year in the playoffs?
Frank Reynolds 6::I hate the heat dude. I am just realistic
dylan2735::Sixers will wake up... Hawes stop being a $@%!$ and get back in the lineup let's go!!!!!!!
JimboSliceLv42::heat will get into the championship and lose to OKC Thunder and every heat fan is gunna be scratching there head not knowing whats going on
Frank Reynolds 6::Yea I can see that.
JimboSliceLv42::yeah and the bobcats will make the playoffs good one
Frank Reynolds 6::Like I was saying no team can be the heat in the playoffs so it does not matter
windy.city.assassin::Remember at the beginning of the season when people thought Phili was good?
sumbrownkid::How about we watch them play instead of predicting.    If Miami is so vaunted then why did they lose to the bucks?  I'm just tired of people treating the heat like some basketball gods when they have failed to back up their talk.  The Bulls overachieved last season.  But hello what's this?  We're number one again?  With more injuries?  And with more games played?  If you're confident in your team then stop talking and just play
Rick-Da-Villain::The heat ain't s.hit..they can be beaten like anyone else..
Frank Reynolds 6::Not in the east in a 7 game series
Frank Reynolds 6::It's not like any team in the east can beat the heat in the playoffs so what is the difference?
Gt_jackets89::Almost blew another lead, but good win, and fear the deer!
WiscCHISportsFan12::Bucks won?! What? No way.
higginbombers::Yes way
JimboSliceLv42::pretenders not contenders
IAMpunter2609::Spot on sixers are mud
berniebronc::Sixers better than last year, but they can't close out anybody to save their lives. They don't have a go to when the game's on the line. They just disappear. AI isn't the answer. They need to find one, and he's not on their roster right now.
milwaukeemonster::what we got a win!!! h e l l yeah!!!
Winnipeg Thrashers::HAHAHHAAAHAHAHAA  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  HAHAHAAHAHAHHA
Winnipeg Thrashers::HAHAHHAAAHAHAHAA  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  HAHAHAAHAHAHHA
NickMull2::They just don't play food d on the road. Period
coverthespread69::maybe if the 76ers wouldve scored more than 16 points in the 3rd, they wouldve won this game
picaac15::What the $@%! are the Bucks doing, beating the Heat twice, Sixers once, cant beat the other teams.. The $@%! is wrong here
Winnipeg Thrashers::HAHAHHAAAHAHAHAA  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  HAHAHAAHAHAHHA

buckspackers23::Well, Good game Sixers fans, see you in a few weeks to start off a back-to-back-to-back.

NickMull2::When it came down to it, Philly just didn't have enough defense to stop the offensive juggernaut of the Bucks
