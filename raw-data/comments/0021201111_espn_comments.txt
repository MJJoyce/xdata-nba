dwade grater den jordan 15.0::nene sux now  just myu 2 sense tho
hamel89::Val is finally getting into his groove now that he's staying healthy!
huskers-PVAMU::Please, im begging you, do not call him Val.
Hank10593::Wall is trying to Kobe his way out of this season. Chucking up shots just to prove that he is worth the max contract?
EHBonacker::24 pts in the 1st. 26 pts in 2nd. 28 pts in all 2nd half?  70% of the money on Wash but line goes up?  NBA is such a fix league.  I guess making 5 million / year isn't enuf!
Chawks116::A technical foul on Acy?
ElPlywood::Ross only gets 8 minutes in a mean nothing game? Ridiculous.
Jumeax::and 6 pts on 25% shooting is TOTALLY worth 18 MILLION
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Every game means something. We are building a culture in Toronto. Gotta earn your minutes plain and simple.
banode123::Congrats, Raptors. That was a painful loss, but it is what it is. Better luck for both of our franchises next year!
hamel89::Raps just need to stay healthy! Can't have the whole roster (other than DeRozan) missing significant time!
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Yup both teams are making the playoffs. Celtics and Milwaukee out. Milwaukee is gonna lose one of their main weapons and Celtics are old as dirt, and this year have been just good enough to have their hand held by the Refs all year. Next year will be different.
lugankid::Celtic wont be out, Green is coming on strong, pierce can still play, bradley is a defensive wiz that can score, and rondo will be back. Plus they have lots of cap room to go after FAs. There is a better chance that Atlanta will be out. Their team will be hortford and teague and thats it.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::What an awesome post game interview from Kyle. "This is our team"
skinnyyy::JV and ACY are the future
PK009::JV been balling lately
mikemcclain1::john wall is a idiot no need to foul dummy
ignasm::And the double- double for JV!
ignasm::Career high for the rookie JV!
GeorgeTownDC29::GG Raps
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Dominant game for Jonas. Hard to win when the other teams 7 footer is playing this well.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Where is Buzzy Beal?
rapfan73::i know right he killed us but respect to him he is amazing!
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::No way!!! Aww man that sucks. Kid has been killin us this year but I still like his game.
rapfan73::injured broken ankle done for season
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Did anyone else see that cool article that by the numbers when Torontos starting 5 is together on the court we are the 4th Best Defensive team and the 5th best offensive team? Only Alan Anderson hasnt killed the numbers. Proved what I have been saying since Rudy got there. We are an awesome team just need Ross and Telfair and Fields to start holding their own and watch the F out.
0ffense::ugly.
JKL11293::give me that double double valanciunas
Boris_Monson813411::You have to try this:  http://tinyurl.com/free-nba-challenge3
BigLeagueCiu::Wizards were so close to getting Valanciunas, such a shame.
LookarooTwentytwo::I bet Ernie would have picked Vesely instead
Real Deal Beal::I doubt it
BigLeagueCiu::LOL
BigshotRob is the Best::Rudy Gay is not a franchise player
Jumeax::you mean 6 pts on 25% shooting is not worth 18 Million?!?!!  Get out!
Joeb7853::24 points in the second half with 3 minutes to play? Washington will be a decent team when they figure out how to play a second half. Top shooters choking late and poor coaching is a big problem. Wall is only a starter, not a finisher.
LookarooTwentytwo::Wall is a pass first point guard. He generally needs people who can actually put the ball in the hoop when he passes it to them which the wiz couldn't tonight
LookarooTwentytwo::Wizards have only 3rd string shooting guards in their lineup (with Beal out)
huskers-PVAMU::Why did they trade a good backup SG for a washed up PG with a torn ACL. The Wizards are making some questionable decisions, and if they don't stop soon they won't have much of a future.
arvinramroop::gonna say it early....GG Wizard's fans
ksmit111::The wiz cant hit anything lol
ksmit111::Dish the ball wall
GeorgeTownDC29::Come on Wiz! Learn to win on the road
PartTimeHomer::Kryptonite.
Real Deal Beal::ugh not Wall's night shooting
PartTimeHomer::Wish he'd understand it, though and work to get his teammates shots.
PartTimeHomer::Teammates not named Okafor.
PartTimeHomer::Nope. That's to be expected, though.
Chawks116::No Gray or Lucas= good team
The Nuggets Big 3 Heart_Teamwork_Speed::John Wall, max contract?
joeyxfly::he is the only player on washington scoring
Real Deal Beal::not his greatest game tonight but yes probly
arvinramroop::ACY GOT HIS MINUTES :)
ignasm::that he did... also got a dunk :)
PartTimeHomer::Holy crap, a foul.
PartTimeHomer::Well, that wasn't worth it at all.
PartTimeHomer::And that wasn't even really a foul. lol refs
steve_cronin61::love how toronto is suddenly a team of 5 lebron james
MMhater1::18 FT in one quarter.  Damn!
LookarooTwentytwo::Garrett Temple has no business starting but the Wizards have no other shooting guards with Beal out. They
BigLeagueCiu::Jonas is BEASTING, so much better than that other JV that plays for the Wizards...
Joeb7853::12 point quarters probably explains why the Wizards are 7-29 on the road. The baskets are the same height in every arena in the league guys.
LookarooTwentytwo::The Wizards players besides Wall can't do s.hit.
Joeb7853::And Wall chokes when it matters.
LookarooTwentytwo::What are you talking about give one example
PartTimeHomer::Well, that's a lie.
ksmit111::Lol are they gonna call a single foul on the raptors?
PartTimeHomer::Nope.
Oriolebullet::Why do they keep throwing up 3 after3
joeyxfly::wow this game is so disfunctional
ksmit111::This officiating is a joke
LookarooTwentytwo::Refs have made this game unwatchable.
LookarooTwentytwo::This is pathetic. Refs need to stop.
PartTimeHomer::Okay, refs.
arvinramroop::ACY TECHINCAL :(
PartTimeHomer::All the cheap calls in the world. Didn't realize we were playing a Kobe team.
MMhater1::They look like they have their daily stipend on the game.
Real Deal Beal::JOHNNNNNNNN WAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Oriolebullet::Minn by10 over mil.  We win out they lose out n were n lol
steelcurtain09::Well... so much for that...
Real Deal Beal::Today is a great day. up 4-0 and winning here too
