Cyril::As the starting point guard:  Felton - 10.3 points, 2.4 rebounds,5.2 assists, 0.9 steals, 39% FG, 28% 3pt, 32 minutes per game Udrih - 9.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.8 assists,0.8 steals,  48% FG, 52% 3pt, 30 minutes per game  So...tell me again why Ray Felton got his starting position back immediately?  Udrih shot much better than Ray, pulled down more rebounds, and he actually had a comparable assist-to-turnover ratio (5.2 to 2 for Ray, 4.8 to 1.7 for Beno).  It's not like chubby cheeks is a great defender, and having Udrih's shooting to space the floor seemed to be an improvement over Felton constantly driving with no place to go.
NBA-Fan::New NBA rule starting 2014: for a team that hasn't made it past the second round playoff for 10 years, its ownership must be given up for open auction.  Not joking.
Will B::Shump cutting his hair and the orange uniforms have lost us at least 10 games. Discuss.
DJCOOLC::One question..who is teaching the knicks how to box out from the 12 coaches. They also need to stop practicing and shoot 500 shots each and driving down the lane instead, because it's ridiculous that nobody can make a shot and they call themselves pros, shooting 1-17 every night
Amir::What is Magic strategy regarding playoffs?  To hit it during 2023?
Carl07::Two mediocre teams. Knicks won because Carmelo the ball hog is out of the critical fourth quarter.
creep::The Knicks can win if Carmelo Yellow can refrain from jacking up 75 shots.
46064::Nice thing about this game - someone has to win!
Sean Lockyer::Good Lord the Magic suck! They aren't without talent and should at least be able to compete for a .500 record and a playoff spot in the watered down east but at this point can Jacques Vaughn do any better coaching this team ? I don't think so. SVG would have this team playing at least .500 ball. No hustle, no physical play, just a bunch of "guys" playing ball......
L.E.S. the lower::4 games behind Toronto,4,that's right 4.I know we can take this division.A little luck,Schumpert grows that old hairdo,yep!
