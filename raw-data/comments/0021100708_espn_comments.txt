GsU -3000-GsU::good team win!
Cardinals542::I hope the jazz get the 6 or 5 spot, because we can beat the lakers and whoever is the 4th seed in the playoff (unless it is Dallas). If we can only get the 7th and 8th seed, I would rather get the 8th because we have a better chance against oklahoma city than san antonio.
Cardinals542::how did afflolo get ejected? The highlights didn't show me how he got ejected. Anyway, good win for my favorite team, go Jazz!
Ruckusmh::Elbow to the face tends to do that.
skeele801::Are you serious?
Steelers7160::Nuggets should've traded afflolo not nene. Aaa is horrible and apparently now a cheap shot. Get rid or him now!!!
Bugginruss32::I think the Nuggets are that bad.  They started off the season well but have been one the worst teams since then.  They will not make the playoffs.  The Jazz shouldn't be that excited beating this denver team.  For crying out loud the nuggs nearly blew a 24 pt lead 2 nights ago against one of the worst teams in the nba at home.
Robert41686::of course the jazz should be excited. We're the team that everyone under estimates, the team that every one thinks will lose. But we are finally proving our selves.
jimmy5804::The Jazz *are* justified in being excited about a six game win streak that includes wins over the lakers and the thunder.
tcrisis::JAZZ FANS UNITE
Joey801bear::All of a sudden the Jazz are the hottest team in the league!
7BAUGHLLIN7::Yezzir joeybear.. Layin all out.. Jazz 7 spot big boy
Free Alec Burks::Oh sh*t no one is here.
Free Alec Burks::Devin Harris was 3 on nba . com
WILSON CHANDLER 21::the board is officially asleep
7BAUGHLLIN7::I think erbody may have overdosed on tylonol
JustineS04::I'm all worried about Diehard!
BarkBarkForPig::has anyone watched the nba . com top 10? how in the world is Durant's 3 pointer number 1 over Love's 3????? Durant's put them ahead by 3, Loves was a buzzer beater to put it into over time. (not to mention the lack of jazz highlights)
BarkBarkForPig::yeah that is true. i rarely find an nba top 10 i approve of, i should just stop caring
BarkBarkForPig::ridiculous. makes no sense at all.. KG had a not impressive oop at all, he actually got rim stuffed but it still went in somehow, and that made it to the top 10. they didn't put millsaps dunk up there, i thought it was pretty impressive
WILSON CHANDLER 21::the only reason i can think of is because it was a later game than all the others
WILSON CHANDLER 21::rigged
March Madness.::If Kobe rapes a girl in the woods and no one hears it, is it really a rape?
WILSON CHANDLER 21::idk
JustineS04::I'm really tempted to send an ambulance out to his house.
7BAUGHLLIN7::Do it! Ben siller starsky and hutch voice..
7BAUGHLLIN7::Herrs to hoping.. Raise beers :)
JustineS04::Well I think his roommate will handle it.
BarkBarkForPig::do you know where he lives?
JustineS04::I know the city and his name.
WILSON CHANDLER 21::http://games.espn.go.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/en/entry?entryID=1166632
JustineS04::I have UNC over KY too, but now I don't like it that much since their PG is hurt.
WILSON CHANDLER 21::i thought UNC was gonna lose today in overtime
JustineS04::Looks a lot like mine, except I had Wisconsin over Syracuse.
BarkBarkForPig::pretty good looking bracket
WILSON CHANDLER 21::did you see obama's? his is amazing
TAC0REV::Jazz have been beasting!
7BAUGHLLIN7::See... Diehard renewd
BarkBarkForPig::haha this diehardnr1 sentences make way too much sense for that to be the same guy
7BAUGHLLIN7::Right there \/
JustineS04::Doesn't the coherent typing give it away?
JustineS04::Different one :(.
BarkBarkForPig::haha where?
diehardnr1::Now its official.... Nuggz lose every tie breaker with every contender....  Not sure if its the D that is so bad or just that teams seem to shoot lights out when they play us...as UTA  near 60% shooting shows.  Faried needs to stop bouncing in and out of his picks and actually SET a pick in order to get the roll---he'll learn  Not sure why Big Al seems to have such a problem defending the paint---maybe too many minutes is tiring him out and a tired Al is a clumsy Al-  The team is still learning and dealing with injuries...hopefully will gel soon cuz this win one lose one win one lose one crap is getting old...  GO NUGGETS!!!
BarkBarkForPig::gotcha
BarkBarkForPig::i'm sorry for my lack of knowledge, but is there a player on the nuggets that you guys call big al? i was really confused when i saw that in your comment
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::Big AL is on the JAZZ...Al Harrington's nickname isn't Big al...who are you kiddin?
JustineS04::Al Harrington.
JustineS04::I don't think everyone putting up numbers on us is a coincidence.  Yes, Al is getting too many minutes. Ever notice how he shoots much better fresh off the bench?
diehardnr1::Seems like it lately.... Gordon with career and NBA numbers off of good D     I think teams prepare for Nuggets by practicing 3s and running plays to get open looks since Nuggz can't switch more than once apparently.......once the 3s start falling, then the paint is open and Nuggz can't seem to learn how to defend the P&amp;R and voila down 20pts.  I worry more about the supposed "D" guys (such as AAA) getting burned game after game  Rudy and Gallo being gone definitely doesn't help either....
WILSON CHANDLER 21::Last Words: JaVale is a keeper
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::yeah if you own an insane asylum
sfy2004::would they lock up DeMarcus Cousins or Javale Magee first?
NickInP-Town::i realize the nuggets have added some new pieces this past week but there is no excuse for this horrendous defense. i could do a better job of coaching how to defend the pick and roll. they look like high schoolers.
JustineS04::Worse actually. Most high schoolers can rotate and your average toddler can count to 3.
NickInP-Town::you're absolutely right...they are completely clueless on their defensive rotations. case in point, ben gordon a few days ago. he tore them to shreds because afflalo (who i thought was a good defender) continuously was coming off the pick and roll the wrong way, leaving him wide open...the rotations tonight weren't any better. I could teach a youth church league how to get open perimeter shots against these guys. it's embarrassing.
WILSON CHANDLER 21::if they get defense they will get a ring
7BAUGHLLIN7::Hes messin around guys.. He just wants us to let him know ppl actually care
BarkBarkForPig::well if that's true.. that's an a$$hole move and pretty sad to do over an espn conversation
WILSON CHANDLER 21::ya, why would somebody who is dying go on an espn board.
JustineS04::Nah, he's not like that.
JustineS04::He has a roommate, so you'd think he would have heard him.
BarkBarkForPig::his roommate sounded like he was pretty preoccupied with how i met your mother though
WILSON CHANDLER 21::hahaha
WILSON CHANDLER 21::ya
NickInP-Town::"so coach karl do you know how to coach defense?" "no."
Free Alec Burks::He probably saw the highlights of the Jazz and Nuggets on ESPN and just lost all will.
7BAUGHLLIN7::Diiieeehhhaaarrrddd!!!! Noooooooo!
7BAUGHLLIN7::Diehard are you liking my comments? You f uckin with  ushuh :)
WILSON CHANDLER 21::no,  but i hope hes alright
JustineS04::Is that you? I can't keep everyone's extra accounts straight.
WILSON CHANDLER 21::sorry
BarkBarkForPig::yo diehard, reply if you're there
BarkBarkForPig::twue
BarkBarkForPig::and Afflalo, for that cheap shot
JustineS04::Mostly GK.
BarkBarkForPig::yeah.. i usually don't get too involved on these boards but i sincerely hope he's alright
JustineS04::He should be ok. In all likelihood the blood is from throwing up too hard. This is all George Karl's fault.
JustineS04::Tylenol overdose is awful. Hopefully he's ok.
yousername::hey jazz fans...im not mormon..i have not told you my affiliation as far as my favorite team and i am not white. please tell me if you agree that the jazz cant win it all in your best mitt romney voice
BarkBarkForPig::for real though, i see tons of hipsters in SLC. weirdos
yousername::yup. weak ones at that
BarkBarkForPig::ehh.. what about next year when hopefully the Jazz have a young point guard? (despite Harris playing well tonight, i still think the answer is to find a young point guard)
yousername::im a casual jazz fan but they arent my favorite. the young guys are really full of potential and i appreciate your response. i think the jazz are on their way up but they arent as good as the nuggets despite tonights performance
BarkBarkForPig::it's down south in Provo where you'll probably find more
BarkBarkForPig::...? i'm a jazz fan but i don't think they can win it all this year. it's just fun to watch the young guys, and finally see them work as a team
Free Alec Burks::What makes you think every Jazz fan is mormon?
sfy2004::wow, how terrible it is to have a population that accepts people the way they are, in spite of our idiotic Legislature. just absolutely terrible. maybe we should start hating like everyone else? right? just hate someone because they happen to be "That Way"?
purple-and-gold::It's about 70% non lds, but only in SLC itself. In Salt Lake County, the percentage of mormons is a lot higher. Mormons seem to shy away from the population centers, they're a suburban people.
yousername::how many are permanent residents...and actually watch basketball, not even throwing in the fact that slc is becoming the next san francisco as far as hipster homosexuals go
Free Alec Burks::it's actually about 70% not lds in slc
yousername::they arent all mormon, over half of slc is not mormon,
EMCanada::I only got 8 Jazz loses for the rest of the season but I think  the only incredibly troublesome games are with San Antonio, Dallas and Orlando. Everything else seems wide open.
BarkBarkForPig::assuming they keep playing like this. ya never know when a slump will show up
JazzFanFromINDIA::Next 6 games stretch will be very crucial for Utah . Road Games except the Sacramento Queens one.  I would be happy if the Jazz finish 4-2. GO JAZZ GO !!
fuzzjar::Well, it's been real peeps.  Time to hit the sack.  Go Jazz.
fuzzjar::sounds fun, but i have to try to convince my wife that i didn't stay up too late...
JustineS04::Sounds more fun.
JustineS04::Night. Sure you don't wanna stay for the ESPN-tervention?
DenverDiehard35::i dont wanna die all alone
JustineS04::Yeah, Vicodin has acetaminophen in it (Tylenol). You mixed it with alcohol, and now you may have Tylenol poisoning. The same thing happened to me (on Tylenol) and I threw up tons of blood. You might want to get it checked out. Where's your roommate.
Free Alec Burks::He stopped posting...... Diehard you there?
JustineS04::The first signs of an acetaminophen overdose include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, sweating, and confusion or weakness. Later symptoms may include pain in your upper stomach, dark urine, and yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes.  Overdose symptoms may also include extreme drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, cold and clammy skin, muscle weakness, fainting, weak pulse, slow heart rate, coma, blue lips, shallow breathing, or no breathing.  You're supposed to go to the hospital if you are.
7BAUGHLLIN7::Diehard dont go dieing on us bro..
7BAUGHLLIN7::Who liked that comment.. Its not funny.. Hes taking that loss really badly..
DenverDiehard35::ill try not to mman  idont feel well
BarkBarkForPig::if you didn't fall on your face and you're finding blood in your mouth that's gotta be bad. i've never heard of that before
DenverDiehard35::im throwin it up and also mu eys vleedin?
JustineS04::I've thrown up blood before. It's bad if it's coming from your stomach. It's not as bad if you broke a blood vessel in your throat from coughing or throwing up.
BarkBarkForPig::blood in your mouth and you don't know what it's from? thaaat's pretty bad, you might wanna call an ambulance
DenverDiehard35::i nsered above
JustineS04::It's less bad if you're coughing. Did you have Tylenol today?
DenverDiehard35::umm idk is that bad?
JustineS04::Are you throwing up or coughing?
BarkBarkForPig::quit drinking, drink water bro. go to the hospital if it gets bad enough. don't pass out
JustineS04::Where's your roommate? Call a cab.
DenverDiehard35::drive
DenverDiehard35::i cant fribe like ths m dude
JustineS04::Why are you going to die?
DenverDiehard35::N o ididn I jst had 3 vocodin for m knees
JustineS04::Did you have tylenol today?
DenverDiehard35::ijus foud blood in my moth lol
JustineS04::Seriously? You're on your own with that symptom. You should probably go to a hospital or a clinic. That's bad.
DenverDiehard35::ugh shti blood
JustineS04::Hey, me too!
DenverDiehard35::my vision is bad and o m not feeling good
Free Alec Burks::I just realized how terrible ROOT sports HD is.
BarkBarkForPig::hahaha for real. garbage
BarkBarkForPig::it's ugly as hell. they're using flip camcorders or something
Free Alec Burks::Flip camera is too nice for that quality. Probably an Iphone 4S or something
scow79::NBA TV didn't even show the Harris dunk.   WTF?
fuzzjar::harris dunking = the exact moment in time the nuggets gave up.
Free Alec Burks::They showed Saps on NBA tonight
JustineS04::Tell me you don't agree, especially from 500 feet away going 60 mph. http://shields.aaroads.com/show.php?image=UT20071191
JustineS04::Thank you, vindication! You can't see the ridges as much when you're driving.
BarkBarkForPig::espn won't let me say t.itty
BarkBarkForPig::haha it does look like a $@%!$ with ridges on it
Cool Sun 13::I think Utah should make an effort to trade for Dwight Howard. Utah is one of the deepest teams in the NBA on role players and youngsters. Which is exactly what Orlando wants.  Here's a potential trade: http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=6p9srxb
EMCanada::Utah would have to make the Western Conference  Finals to even seem like a possibility. Maybe if we can get the 6th seed we can steal a round from the Lakers.
vergatease::yeah no chance in hell he'd consider Utah.
BarkBarkForPig::there's no way in heaven or hell Dwight would live in Utah.  he's a typical super star snob, he wants to play under the spotlights for a contender, period
scow79::Dwight wouldn't resign with Utah
Cool Sun 13::If they can prove to him that they can be contenders, he'd definitely resign. They are a playoff team without him, adding him should make the Jazz an elite team.
JustineS04::Depends on what he had for breakfast that day.
MileHighFan9::About ESPN hating on small market teams we all know its true, Nuggets handedly beat the the red hot Heat two months ago...nothing..same with the win against the Spurs not a peep.
Nostoppage::Burks will be starting next yrs if not he will have starter minutes.
scow79::I don't think Jefferson or Millsap will be with the Jazz.   If they succeed in the playoffs then I could be wrong.
UTES.JAZZ.NINERS::He is getting the same if not more minutes than millsap did back in the day. Give the 20 year old some time. Make him earn his minutes
fuzzjar::he might be able to get there though if he's given the chance.  like i said, millsap wasn't knocking down Js 5 years ago like he is now.
grsshppr::His range is within 2 feet.  He is not even close to the talent of Al or Milsap.  They can both shoot a jump shot, and poor Favors hasn't learned what a jump shot is. I think Favors is great, but he's not even close to either of those other guys.
fuzzjar::I think it could go another couple years like this.  Look at Millsap: he wasn't nearly as proficient a scorer when he was a soph as he is now.  And he didn't get starter minutes until, what...last year?  And he's a stud.
scow79::Favors.  If he's going to ever reach his full potential then he has to get minutes.
fuzzjar::why would the jazz trade either of those two?
BarkBarkForPig::Harris Burks Hayward Millsap Jefferson  You think that would work well?
scow79::And Bell will be long gone
JustineS04::Was there ever any talk of changing the Jazz' name?
BarkBarkForPig::makes sense. all religious opinions aside, i think the SLC temple is beautiful. it's pretty amazing they were able to build that in the 1800's
BarkBarkForPig::woops, guess i don't know my states history too well.. the mormons like beehives?
fuzzjar::they like bees because they are busy workers.  they were adopting a slogan of hard work.
BarkBarkForPig::and i dunno why the hell Utah is the beehive state. i don't see too many bees here
fuzzjar::mormon history bud
BarkBarkForPig::Ok makes sense. People really think the Jazz are the worst named team in any pro franchise? haha geez.. even though it doesn't make sense, i don't think it's the worst
BarkBarkForPig::is there lots of thunder storms in Oklahoma? or is it just randomly named that?
fuzzjar::Actually, "The Thunder" is a very fitting name.  When there are storms, they are crazy.  People here are used to it, but they freak me out.
JustineS04::first time I went to Utah, I thought the highway signs were a certain female anatomy part. You should be the Hornets if you're that into bees.
fuzzjar::hah!  ok....now i get it.  you're a chic, right?  so you would see the anatomy from that angle and make that connection.  But I don't think I've really ever had that point of view.  ;)
JustineS04::The ones on the signs. How can they not, especially from far away? http://shields.aaroads.com/show.php?image=UT20071191
fuzzjar::beehives look like female anatomy to you??  :)
BarkBarkForPig::Nah, way too late to change. Even if it doesn't make sense.  everyone has known Utah as the Utah Jazz for the past 25 years
fuzzjar::that's a great question.  i'm sure there was.  i live in OKC and people out here think the jazz are the worst-named franchise in pro sports.  i don't mind though.  the "OKC Sonics" seems weird at first, but I'm sure we'd all get used to it, just like the NO Hornets.  I still think Charlotte sometimes, but it's not too weird.
BarkBarkForPig::not that i know of.. you would think so huh, since they were the Jazz purely cause of NO. either way, i like the name even if it's in Utah
JustineS04::Yeah, b/c it makes no sense. You and New Orleans should switch names back.
DenverDiehard35::JustineS04 - Was there ever any talk of changing the Jazz' name?
StocktonToMalone 2::GO JAZZ! GO WARRIORS! Byyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeee
BarkBarkForPig::Big market teams get more headlines for going on losings streaks than the Jazz do for going on winning streaks. haha
DenverDiehard35::De ja vu
Cool Sun 13::I think D-Favors could put up superstar numbers once he gets a starting role. He reminds me of K-Love. So many people bashed him and talked about how the T-Wolves were idiots to trade OJ Mayo. OJ started his career off better but look at their careers now.
AshamanKun::You obviously don't watch  the Jazz more than 3 times a year. And you misunderstood what the first guy was saying. Their games are different but both were underestimated. Learn to read.
grsshppr::Really?  Love can shoot anywhere on the floor.  Favors has a range inside 2 feet.  I like the guy and he plays well, but you guys are smoking crack if you think favors is better than Milsap or Al Jeff or even close to K love.  Favors has absolutely no jump shot whatsoever.
StocktonToMalone 2::Do you guys want it to get uncivil? Ha! no just kidding I just got unbanned.
nahhb::nba draft, all nba players are eligible where would u guys put al jefferson? this site had him 18th, seemed too low http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.ca/
grsshppr::this nahhb guy needs to get the HEEELLLLL out of here with his/her propaganda shhhhtuff.  So lame it's not even funny.
BarkBarkForPig::18th? i know his defense is known to be bad, but isn't he one of the top scoring centers in the league?
DenverDiehard35::It's really gotten civil in here.
BarkBarkForPig::hah!
JustineS04::Want a crumpet?
DenverDiehard35::sure wanna wipe my face
JustineS04::Can't have a push-pop b/c 7-11 is out!
fuzzjar::why does this comment sound familiar?
JustineS04::De ja vu...
Cool Sun 13::My man D-Favors is killing it right now, the Jazz should start him alongside Millsap as the 2 forwards. Look like the Jazz are definitely the winner of the Deron trade. The Nets remain irrelevant while the Jazz has finally found themselves the right lineup for success.
scow79::The Nets GM is making them irrelevant.   Can't believe they traded away their lottery pick for a 4 month rental of Gerald Wallace
fuzzjar::yeah that trade blew my mind.  they probably would have been just as successful in persuading williams to stay if they hired someone to wipe his $@%.
JustineS04::I told everyone that 7-11 being out of Flinstone's push-pops was a very bad omen.
BarkBarkForPig::to the guy who said ESPN loves the Jazz: go to the NBA page, the Jazz winning isn't even a headline.  given there was the incredible OKC game that's getting all the attention, there's a headline about River's son declaring for the draft instead of the Jazz blowing out the Nugs
grsshppr::How about when the Jazz smashed that same OKC team the other night?  That was incredible.  I don't care what other people are saying, as Jazz fans we are watching and we can see all the teams that are losing when they try and step in the way of our latest slew of thrashings we've been handing out on the road and at home.  Watch out NBA we are coming to get it.
MileHighFan9::Nuggets handily beat the the red hot Heat two months ago...nothing..same with the win against the Spurs.
BarkBarkForPig::yeah seriously huh. They definitely don't love the Jazz
scow79::They usually have a note to the side saying something like "Struggling Nugs lose again" or something like that.
JustineS04::We typically win and then lose, rinse, repeat, so that probably wouldn't be the headline.
StocktonToMalone 2::The night they won the lakers it said: Kobe, Lakers couldn't get in sync
StocktonToMalone 2::Burks with another 15 points! What's up with Earl playing? I thought he was hurt? haha
scow79::I don't know what the hell Corbin is going to do there.   I think you have to play Tinsley just because he can score points.
fuzzjar::don't think tinsley knew how to run the early-oop.
JustineS04::It's really gotten civil in here.
scow79::It's bc most the Nugget's fans left
JustineS04::You guys had some real charmers too.
fuzzjar::hah!
StocktonToMalone 2::If you take everything Broussard says, then think of the opposite, it usually is true
grsshppr::Broussard is a complete farce and it's an embarrassment to his family and the sport.
scow79::Yeah I think the guy makes up a lot of the rumors he reports.
fuzzjar::heh yeah, his "source" is his conscience.
