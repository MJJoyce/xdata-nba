Pasha::Lets go Kings! Phoenix has good pieces but it will take time so does the Kings.
MrStar7::Green should be the Starting SF of Tucker.
Ogbabyace::FIRE MALONE!!!!
Ogbabyace::Ben McLemore scores 8 point and had a +/- +8 and the Kings win by seven. Ben McLemore is the real reason why the Queen won last night. Take that Jimmer Fredette nuthuggers fan club members
THE_CHIEF::This looks like a replay of yesterday's game almost exactly. o_O
gary::The Suns are one of the worst rebounding teams in the league. Come on you bigs, do something.
Eric::"At lowly Sacramento"  LOL always a jab...
Ogbabyace::Dear #$%$ Jimmer Fredette nuthuggers fan club members,  IDK if you heard the news or not. The only reason why Fredette getting a little more playing time is because Fredette is once again on the trading block. Let's see if ol' Fredette get's trade before the trade deadline even thou we're still months out from the deadline this year. Last year nobody wanted this loser and I think it will be the same this year.
DAVE::there maybe 1500 people at the game
daniel::The reason to play Fredette?  Passing, and shooting.
