danney::Besides Henson starting, he should start Alphabet as a shooting guard rather than small forward. He's production is so little when he is played as a forward. Stats don't lie.
toms::Milwaukee.  Go rockets.
Michael::Larry Drew is an idiot! Start John Henson ya moron!
vergel l::It's like T.J. is the only consistent Rockets player
Michael::Samjon - What you have is a world class player. The have won zero championships. until then the Thunder is like everyone else. They are one sprained ankle away from being mediocre.
D. Darqwon::Wow my back is so hairy and I have no hair on top of my head. Us white folk sure are disgusting!
Marty::As I expected, Lin has a great 1st quarter, got cold sitting on the bench and spend most of the game there since.  McHale is definitely BAD for JLin's career.  The soon Lin can get out of Houston, the better.
MC::All I have to say is that the Yahoo! Rockets comment board is always filled with the same trashy people.  Who has the time to make multiple fake usernames...Get a life people.
Uncle Dunk::Good win for Houston but not good enough to become play off team. They allow the Bucks to score more than 100 not showing any good effort on defense everybody was having fun and Mc Hale sitting waiting for the game clock run out to collect his money....Pity not good enough character to be an elite team.
Kicker::Parsons and Lin didn't have a good night, so what. NOBODY is going to have a good game every game. They've already established themselves as being solid players. Haters can keep on hating all they want due to their miserable lives LMAO.
