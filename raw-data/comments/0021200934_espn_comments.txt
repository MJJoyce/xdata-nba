LEBRON IS A DEER HUNTER::Tough loss for Boston. Still hoping they get a 6 seed and play the Knicks in the 1st round.
Dodgerblog2013::He don't want Leheat?
Trizzle0047::Lol
nhraven52::Knicks will sweep them.
CelticPatriot17::laughable
BostonHerald::Durant is a wussy... A whiney lil wusssy... Remove w insert a capital P.... I hate Lebron ... But he's a player.... Thie Blunder are a bunch of hypeds wannabes promoted to sell the game interntionally... And yeah.... That means Daddy Stern is their Lord and Savior
I worship TV::Grow up kid, you know nothing of Durant. Just because he isn't a thug like Bostons team doesn't make him a wussy, and by the way who the $@%! says wussy anymore?
Matthew Borba::47-16 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 34-28
BostonHerald::The Blunder SUCK... Westbrook is a disaster dummy waiting to implode  Durant is a wuss who is alway looking for a call and can't play a lick of defense Ibaka is a human pogo stick who is clueless on pick and rolls Perkins just plain out sucks..... This is a Championship team..... Really????    REALLY??.?
tonysooners1981::You're just pissed that the one championship you bought was all you got.  Now those guys are ancient and Rondo is all that is left now.  Have fun fightin' it out for the 8 seed for the next oh...decade or so.  Shortcuts never last.  OKC was put together the right way and will be on top for a long time.  Sorry bout' it kid.
Jimmy30313::All we got? How many titles has OKC won again? This is Boston, we will always be contenders
Dodgerblog2013::His Celtic pride is showing
I worship TV::I love the hate from Boystown. Keep it coming.
BostonHerald::Is Westbrook on meds..... If he wasn't playing basketball he'd be robbing old ladie leaving CVS
Celtics1634::Not a championship team at all.  That's why they got waxed vs. the Heat in the Finals
ThunderHornz::Lol- silly seltics
Celtics1634::Get off your high horse.  Both teams won on their home court
Dodgerblog2013::Thats because Stern ordered the Thunder to lose.
oblique15::does not change what he said  plus the Thunder look like crap every time the go up against the Heat
Matthew Borba::The only reason it was even a 12 point game was because KD wasn't hitting shots he normally does, and RW was on a hobbled ankle.
Jimmy30313::Even heat fans were saying Boston got robbed haha
Dodgerblog2013::Well thats like hearing things on the internet. It must be true
Jimmy30313::Im willing to put this down to an off game.
CrimsonEyedDeath::I'm willing to put this down to a typical game from a bad team.
Jimmy30313::Yes, but not typical of the Celtics
ToTheTop55::Been betting with an online system called Sportsbettingstar for a few months. I have made over $3,000 a month now for three straight months since I started following it. This system was on the very first page of Google when I searched for  Sports Betting Systems. It is extremely popular and if you have not heard of this system I highly recommend it.
jonlesterscurveball::i hope these thunder fans realize they won because of free throws kd went 6/16 and had one nice move on a 36yr old center
tonysooners1981::It seems like everyone on the Celtics is 36 years old.
rondo2KG::honestly that game didn't really mean much in the grander scheme of things.
Dodgerblog2013::It did to those Grand dads on the Celtics
bostonceltics344::Give credit to Thunder,KG was missing key shots and the bench turning the ball over, and 27 points from the free throw for the Thunder.
kitastrophy34::lowest scoring this year for the Thunder and they still get the win!
Mieryekit::Good D on both KD &amp; RW.. just an off night for us.. that's OK!  Let's start the NEW winning streak..!   -GO C's! ^_^
bbeaver288::Jason Terry needs to start over Courtney Lee. jason terry is better and more experienced
ThatsGoodSoup7963::His preferred role.
rondo2KG::Terry is a 6th man forever
Celtics1634::Brandon Knight after getting dunked on: "It wasn't in the scouting reports that the clippers threw lobs lol"  At least he can laugh about it
fuqet::Doc needs to play Shavlik. He was the leading scorer in the China leauge. I bet he would be instant offence off the bench.
Celtics1634::This is such a ridiculous comment.  This has to be Shavlik himself.  No other explanation
Dwayne_Johnson23::I like it more when we win
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Damn.
WhyMeESPN::Very simple, Comrade Stern wants a Heat vs Thunder rematch in the finals. Watch the officiating when either of those two teams play and you'll have no doubt...unless you're blind
LAKERS We The Best::has Kevin Garbrick stop jacking up bricks yet at one point he brick 10 straight shots LOL
bbeaver288::If the lakers are the best why are they losing so much?(:
owl3030::KG is so old and slow he can't even swing his elbows fast enough to catch someone.
lance_baldwin_lbst::You celtics fans are going a little crazy. Yeah you guys have a good team, but you can't compete with the Thunder or Heat come playoff time.
cowboyinorange87::even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and then
coach p33::we will. were clutch. we always get better come playoff time like last year with the heat.
TresMilagro::Not too unexpected, but we did beat them at home. Hell, how many teams this year have swept the Thunder?
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::If a couple of KG's shots would have went in it would have been a different game
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Yeah that's true, I'm just glad it wasn't worse. We stuck in there tho huh?
alexj26602::i still feel like we had a chance though
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Damn that was a hard loss, at least our next game is a for sure win! At least we split the series 1-1, I'm still proud of our celtics and props to THE TRUTH. Without him it wouldn't have been as close as it was!!!!!!!!!!
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::"Every night, we can't go out and expect to put up 100 points and the score to be 120-100. "  Definitely wouldn't want that since it would mean you were expecting to lose by 20 every night.
I love THC::Harden&gt;Westbrook
marcusmart::2 assists for Westbrook. We're not gonna beat the heat if our Point Guard gives us only 2 assists.
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Yeah I do but to be honest it should have been a blow out, the fact we stuck in there and prevented you guys from running all over us, I think we deserve it!!!
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Not to mention that Avery Bradley was pressuring him all game, I think instead if trying to pass it he was to busy trying to score on Bradley!! Good D Bradley, major PROPS
marcusmart::PROPS for your own player lol. I'll give him props, you can give OKC props for the win.
I focus on my team rather than talking trash about yours::Westbrook is pretty good but sometimes he plays with a Shooting guard's mentality.
richiemets7::the knicks are actually #2 in the east
CrimsonEyedDeath::You spelled 'Celtics' wrong there, suchita.
I love THC::the East has one elite team.
suchita36::Knicks will be first round exit in the playoffs again.
richiemets7::no a617guy the celtics r in 6th so they arent #2
ncjcrsu::If anyone hasn't seen it yet, Bill Simmons' article on bad contracts was actually a good read.    I loved the couple shots he took at Cleveland.
pimphofoo@yahoo.com::His articles are hit and miss but that one was good, although it was brutal seeing three Warriors contracts in the top 10. Bogut is terrible ugh. Then of all things same day Monta comes to Oakland and kills them and Bogut had his typical meaningless game.
Boomtown405::I wont read anything that idiot writes.
a617guy::It's #1) Heat, #2) Celtics, then the rest of the NBA.
poopwonk1::#1 Stern
lance_baldwin_lbst::#1 Thunder
spursdrtd::Is there a team besides the Heat from the East that would have a winning record in the West?
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Believe it or not our BOSTON team can compete with the best of them.  Hearing people write us off only adds fuel to the fire that's already been burning!!!
spursdrtd::Oh no doubt the Heat are solid. But beyond them?
suchita36::Celtics game the Heat more of a challenge last year than did Thunder.
suchita36::Remember:  The East won the last Championship.  And it looks like, the winner will come from the East again.
Lemon Grab::spursdrtd - Is there a team &gt;&gt;&gt;besides the Heat&lt;&lt;&lt; from the East that would have a winning record in the west?
CrimsonEyedDeath::Things the Celtics will not be doing this season.  Winning the NBA Title.  Making it past the first round.  Getting any younger.  Beating the Heat.
CrimsonEyedDeath::Should have said 'not beating the Heat in the playoffs'.  But keep thinking the Celtics will win the NBA Title.  That'll comfort you when your sorry team is fishing after they get bounced in the first round.
Cswillwin::avg age of Cs 29, heat is 30
Cswillwin::0-4 on everything u said, cs match up the best wit the heat
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::We've already gotten young so yeah it would be kinda hard to get any younger
richiemets7::celtics suck
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::Fan of someone we SPANKED many times
richiemets7::standings
Cswillwin::knicks r done bro
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::You are mentally handicap.
_BleedingBoston::Yesterday on the Amare Stoudemire out for 6 months thread, there were so many cocky Knicks fans thinking they actually have a chance to win the east. Even though they haven't won a playoff series in over a decade
1STOCKTONN4TIVE::That's funny because even if they had him I don't see them making it to the 2nd round
richiemets7::dude check the standings ur team sucks
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::C's can still make a run.
Flyguys623_::DBS &gt; BB
_BleedingBoston::At one point, the mods banned me every time I posted under DBS. I wish I could go back to that name
Grapenuts580::Thunder Up!!!!
WhyMeESPN::Every time I hear somebody say that with their southern drawl it makes me want to throw up
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::shut up
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::But GG
Celtics1634::My _I Am A Celtic_ account got banned and I pissed off the mods big time in the process.  They went back and got rid of all my comments
_BleedingBoston::But I've had this account for a couple months now. New record
_BleedingBoston::I gave up a long time ago
_BleedingBoston::Just this name and DaBostonStrangler last year
Celtics1634::What was your banned name?
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I bet you were mean. I don't even try anymore.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::They ignore me now.
Celtics1634::Nah.  I just sent them a really condescending email
Flyguys623_::sup uk
_BleedingBoston::http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1_rKW3HL9GE#!   fly, watch this..... FILTHY
Flyguys623_::damn
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Sup Fly? Banned?
Flyguys623_::idk
Celtics1634::Why banned?
Flyguys623_::ive been banned
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::DJ, what are your thoughts on the PP for Josh Smith trade?
Celtics1634::I don't ever want to see Josh Smith in a Celtics uniform, especially not with a max contract like Ainge was going to give him.  No thanks
Celtics1634::That's a good point.  I remember reading a bunch of stuff too that said Smith and KG don't really get along.  They looked fine to me the other day on the court going against each other.  And that's saying something considering KG basically hates everyone.  On the other hand, I heard Doc say that he wouldn't want to coach Smith because of the type of player he is.  Either way, it's not happening with our cap the way it is
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::You think Doc is going to deal with that? No way. He'll be under the basket where he belongs.
Celtics1634::And if he stops shooting 3's
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I think Smith can be a superstar under the right coach.
Celtics1634::http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1_rKW3HL9GE#!  Unbelievable
_BleedingBoston::Holy $@%! sick dunk
Celtics1634::Poor kid
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I'm letting you know in advance that I'm probably going to hate this.
Celtics1634::Ohhh right.  I didn't even think about that prior to posting it.  Just thought it was an incredible play
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Who was it over?
Celtics1634::I doubt it, highly doubt it
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Damn you.
suchitta36::We should break 80 against the Bobcats, maybe as many as 82.
_BleedingBoston::The Bobcats are putrid. The Celtics should be able to crack triple digits on that swiss cheese defense.
Celtics1634::You're not fooling anyone troll
suchitta36::Neither are the Bobcats, we got this, I think.
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::I miss Rondo
Celtics1634::He went to a terrible college
Celtics1634::Of course I forgot about that.  It doesn't fit my argument
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Neither man focused on academia during their tenure in college and it is widely known that Rondo has a very high IQ.  And I don't care how well the C's are playing without him. Lest you forget the slump  by Pierce and others prior to Rondo's injury?
Celtics1634::I'm assuming you mean basketball IQ (considering one went to Kentucky and the other went to freaking Duke).  I'll give it to Rondo but I'm deducting major points considering how well the C's are playing without him.  I mean, if he's so smart, shouldn't have he figured this offense out instead watching it flourish without him?
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::True. But Rondo is a lot more intelligent than him.
Celtics1634::Not even you believes that
UK_will_beat_up_Aingeifthistradegoesdown::Kyrie sucks
Philipcarpenter11::if only the c,s could have rondo ,green,and Bradley all healthy then we would be really good but good game anyway go celtics
_BleedingBoston::I don't mind this loss. The Celtics hung in there but the Thunder were too much for them to handle.
Celtics1634::I concur
suchita36::I think Doc. might need to give Kevin tons of rest down this stretch to be ready for the playoffs.
2524thomas::Doesn't matter cause they are a one and done team...
Dribbird.::Thanks Nostradumbass.
suchita36::Who knows how much Terrence Williams and DJ White can help this team?  And they will need some minutes in NBA to showcase what they can do, and to sharpen their skills.  But Bass was strong on the boards.  Needs to bring that every night, maybe he felt threatened by DJ White for his starting job.
Celtics1634::I think White can help.  Not so sure about Williams, but the depth is better than nothing
