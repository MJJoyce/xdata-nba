sodas32::Jimmer is a rookie!!! He has scored 17 and 13 and has looked really good in a couple of his games. His shots are short, which is predictable because coming from college to the NBA is a big difference with back to back and even back to back to back so he is tired. Plus the lockout so all the rookies were thrown into the fire. And Outlaw, Salmons, Evans, Cousins, Thornton don't even know what a pass is except to not pass up a shot. HE WILL BE FINE IT'S CALLED GROWING PAINS EVERY ROOKIE HAS THEM!!!
Greg_T60::I love what I saw from Faried last night, but really hope fans don't make him the next Tebow. We all know how that's working out. Give him time. He's a rookie  Having said that, not a bad 1st day on the job for Faried http://www.nba.com/video/channels/top_plays/2012/01/03/20120103_top10.nba/
brena555::With Tebow, its not all about any athletic ability, plus much of the Tebow hype is national, not the local fans.  The thing I like about Faried is the story line of a condensed season where its likely players will be hurt and/or tired and how George chooses to play all the talent he has on this team.  Faried will likely get more chances to prove himself this season than in most normal seasons for a rookie under Karl. I don't get excited about many college players, but saw him enough last year to be excited about his prospects with the Nuggets.  Last night was a good start to seeing what he can do.  Thought it classy, him taking the ball at the end of the game and searching out an official to hand it to.  Be polite to the officials, and it will pay him dividends later on which is important in this league.
Eric6203::I think the Denver fans are smarter than the Tebow nuts.  We are not going to put up a billboard demanding Manimal start anytime soon.  I think he looked good and I think GK may move him up to be a change of pace player like Bird is.  I have to admit the kid does bring excitement to the game with his energy and effort.
joeyeasley65653::my grandpa died 15 years ago and noone gave a $@%!
colintrapp::still don't
OFrog::Sac is reflecting what bad ownership does to a team. They have stripped the payroll down to nothing, where the NBA forces them to add salaries. They get junk players, Salmons, Hickson, Outlaw and start or play them heavy minutes. They put a roster together that could not be a worse assembly of mismatched parts or redundancy if they tried to do that. WestPhal is going to pay, like every coach hired after Adelman was fired. Maloofs have destroyed the franchise, burned the fans and tried to sneak out of town.

It's just like the March Madness Bracket except for the NFL Playoffs and the person with the best bracket wins $300 in cash! You pay just $4.95 and someone wins guaranteed! I am also playing their dailystreak where you just pick which teams win each day with no spreads involved and again, a winner is guaranteed each day. The site is so awesome and just wanted to let you all know! Good luck to you all.

mountainboy33::F U C K  ALL  OF  YOU!
mshipp_215::They need to trade Faried...no reason he shouldnt be playing more!!! Stat line like that in 10 minutes then wont play him for another 2 games...thats crazy! Let him shine somewhere else if they dont want to give hime the chance to do so.
brena555::Just shows how deep Denver is.  As I stated above, the thing I like about Faried is the story line of a condensed season where its likely players will be hurt and/or tired and how George chooses to play all the talent he has on this team. Faried will likely get more chances to prove himself this season than in most normal seasons for a rookie under Karl.
Runchamp420::He's a flipping ROOKIE!  For the time being, he's just like Chris Anderson, a bench player that brings a lot of aggression during his limited minutes.  Can't be a starter (yet), Faried still has a ways to go.  Give it until, at least, mid season.
paul2285::He will get his playing time, just be patient, Karl is hesitant to play rooks He will be a beast!
Rick P. Johnson::WTF? Stop posting...
mountainboy33::Great Idea!.....except for one thing...... Then he wouldn't be on our team. Worst idea ever
WhyUHatin47::Faried is a star in the making.
brena555::He reminds me of a taller Calvin Natt, should any older fans be around...
bearsbball11::I see him being the same type of player Birdman is, only better.
soloartist11::Did anyone watch top 10 tonight? They completely snubbed the Rudy to Faried oop. Some of the plays on there completely sucked.
brena555::East coast bias and earlier game times for them is one thing, but I agree, the Nuggets have been having multiple top 10 plays most every game that beats many of the ones they show.  But ESPN had Rudy to Faried #1 in their top 10 for last night.  His block was also a top 10. A link is listed above, although the link actally goes to Tuesday nights games, but you can find Wed. nights from there.
rockiesfan37::I know this is far away but I believe home court will be as important for the Nuggets as anyone else in the league. Nuggets have to take every game seriously and wrap up one of the top seeds to be a true playoff contender. I like their chances given their depth and the density of the schedule this year.

bearsbball11::Hahaha
Denver1153::yeah it was a great game and all but is anyone else bothered we had 26 team TO's?
brena555::They didn't stay focused in a blowout is all it was.  But also, a young team that is what, 50% new, and still learning to play with one another, which means they could get a lot better by years end.
bearsbball11::Not really. If you're complaining or worrying about things after a blowout win, you have your expectations set way too high lol
bearsbball11::Haha of course I can. There better not be anyone getting into arguments, because of course I'll win them lol
DenverDiehard35::do you go to skool out of state too?
CowbellsbeforeSinger::Yay! :) haha wow. Good! That way I can still get into random arguments and have you back me up with stats! Haha woohoo!
bearsbball11::Hahaha I'll be back in June :) And I'll still be on the boards while I'm in Florida
CowbellsbeforeSinger::Ahh yes I almost forgot about you traitorness.....grr haha jkjk that's cool though man. Better be back eventually I'm watching you O.o   ok that was slightly creepy.....I've had to much coffee
bearsbball11::I'm gonna try to go to the all-star game though!
bearsbball11::I had to go tonight, last home game before I leave :/
CowbellsbeforeSinger::Dude that's just not fair man lol. I still have yet to go to a Nuggets game.....which makes me sad
bearsbball11::I was at the game tonight and I was at the Spurs game with the J.R. dunk last year too.  The Nuggets save all their best dunks for me :)
CowbellsbeforeSinger::<b>I am your father</b>  I'm way to easily entertained.....

barcakingsofspainalways::Gallinari...what have I done to you man. This is the second time this week you ended up with the same amount of points in my prop. I played Gasol and you both got 20...killing my wager. I played you today and you only got 8 with Evans killing my wager..what have I done to you man...can't believe it.
DenverDiehard35::thats why i have a strict "no nuggets players" policy on my fantasy teams so i can watch the game without worrying about fantasy results
DenverDiehard35::Nuggets=Best team in the west
antistratfordian::Rudy Fernandez had the dish of the year so far with that no-look, behind-the-head lob.
brena555::I worry about his shooting, and wonder if his being on the list of shooters who can't shoot is accurate.  But love the rest of his game so far and hope his shooting comes around.
cordovader::Rudy enjoys a lot the style of play of the Nuggets, it´s going to be fun to watch
tstruck6024::Fun game to be at even though it was over in the first 5 minutes. That no look alley oop was awesome. Place went crazy.
jonny0916::$@%!
jonny0916::Kings need a coach
Bobby_Rayburn11::the kings had all the hype and talent for things to fall into place this season, and right now it is not looking good.   Tyreke needs to step up as the main leader, kinda like kevin martin did.  Cousins needs to shut up.   But the biggest mistake on this team is ownership who are just fine coasting along on the bottom of the barrel
EastSacTay::Paul Westphal is an IDIOT!
convolutedthought::lol...sac is complete opposite of denver.....denver epitomizes team ball....no ego no selfishness, while sac each players wnats to shoot noone wants pass
helmsey::They have some nice pieces but they do not know how to play "team" basketball.  Their coach need to teach the young players NOT to play me-first, statistic padding basketball.  Almost every Sac possession is one-on-one bball instead of moving the rock around. Not going to win too many games that way.
dking1963::Why did all of the low life losers show up on this site?
