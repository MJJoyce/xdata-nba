RSpesher::I'm not a Knicks fan, but I hope for their sake that Amare never comes back.  He could only make the team worse, and it'd be nice to see a decent basketball team in NY for the first time in my life.
shomu1978::They were decent the first time in your life???? What are you...13?  They were in the Finals in 1999... and they have been to the playoffs after that including last season.
Van Buren Boys 2012::what kind of dumb @ss comment is that!?  You do realize the main reason they lost to Memphis was lack of a presence inside right?  Hmmm, what position does Amare play again?  Melo has been ballin out of control, but if you honestly think he's going to play like this all season with no other consistent scoring help, you're out of your mind.  We need Amare, and we need him to avg about 20 and 8 (which he does typically).  Defensively, yes we need him to commit the way the rest of the team has.  But I don't think that will be a problem because...THE REST OF THE TEAM HAS.  When has a team that he's played on ever been commited to defense?  It takes a special kind of player to be willing to be the only one on your team to play defense, and usually its because they're somewhat lacking offensive talent (i.e. Tyson Chandler).
Van Buren Boys 2012::Not to mention NY owes him somewhat for making basketball relevant again before Melo got there.  All he did was break the record for the most consecutive 30 point games as a Knick
AnthonyS64::yeah man, getting another good player back from injury is a very bad thing  /sarcasm
DanNYC2816::he'll make them better
Canyoudunk86::I knew after yall rated Carmelo number 14 he was gonna go crazy this season. I hope whoever put Carmelo as the number 14th best player in the world is biting his tounge.
doof54::By making Carmelo Anthony their starting power forward, the Knicks have positioned themselves to have no chance against teams with skilled BIGS at center and power forward - The Grizz!  The Knicks go on a road trip and drop three games, and ESPN touts their undefeated home record.  Stupid!
njkaplan::Check the standings as the season marches on.  You'll see several teams with crap road records.  The Knicks just finished a rough stretch.  But let's leave that out of the equation shall we?
nba is the worst::Knicks are 4-3 on the road, including a good win in San Antonio.  They competed in Memphis, the "no chance" thing is an overstatement, since Woodson didn't even play Camby.
Td4mvp3::spurs &gt; your team...fact!
zeller2395::hey espn, NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE KNICKS. THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY TEAM IN THE NBA. DON'T PUT THEM ON THE FRONT PAGE EVERY TIME THEY WIN A DAMN GAME.   -America
njkaplan::If find this to be a rich one.  I can't remember the last time I saw the Knicks on the ESPN home page.  I also don't remember the Knicks getting their own show called "The Decision" - wasn't that some selfish $@%!$@% from Miami.  And doesn't Kobe make news every time he blows his nose.  Yep...I hope the Knicks make the homepage everytime they win so it pisses you off to no end...hater.

deejays2::I'm a knick fan, i love my team but we should all save the ring talk for at least 2nd round of the playoffs.  With that said the same goes for any team in the league including the Heat.
Truth-Big Ticket-FedEx-Jet::Knicks continue to tear it up from 3 point land. <b><u>17-3's!</u></b>
Lakermagicshowtime::I hope this fools realize is November. Still 1st round fooder.Statement game hahahahahahahahhahahaha the Lakers were a horrible mess under Mike Brown and still blew this Pistons team away, statement hahahahahahaha so what kind of statement is the trashing the Knicks got in Houston?
Lakermagicshowtime::somebody here said it was a statement game\ \
Lakermagicshowtime::6-3 since firing Brown at the end of the season they will be the top team in the West. Not in november
deejays2::ridiculous is the lakers playing with all those allstars and Hall of Famers and barely winning games as of late.
Lakermagicshowtime::Calling a November game against the Piston a statement game is the most ridiculous thing i read so far today
nba is the worst::Who called this one a "statement game"?  That's what confused me, I thought you were talking about tonight's Nets-Knicks game.
Lakermagicshowtime::Yeah but that will change soon enough, the LAkers are a contender once they get healthy and are 6-3 since they fired Mr Potato Head and our team have won so many championships to know that wins in November are nearly meaningless.
nba is the worst::"fooder"?  Not another felton joke...  Hope you realize both these teams have a better record than the 7-7 lakers!
nba is the worst::I was talking about Knicks and Nets - who play a statement game tonight
Lakermagicshowtime::So 3-11 is better than 7-7 wow those are some math skills
papuchi24::LMAO I laugh how everyone is putting the NY Knicks in the same category with the Miami Heat.  I guess that's why we have fans.  Knicks have a great start but they will  not be a top three team in the eastern conference when it's all done.  They are atleast 4th or 5th, an old rasheed wallace and jason kid doesnt make you a title contender, sorry guys. go Heat!!
deejays2::he has his facts straight last week wade and lebron where asked who posed the biggest threat to them in the east they both replied the knicks.  Wade said it's scary cause they doing it without shumpert and amare.
papuchi24::after 13 games and 1 head to head match up??? lol
nba is the worst::Err - it's November dude - anyone can make predictions about what teams will or won't finish top three, but it's just meaningless speculation.  In reality, the heat are up by 1/2 game.  The reality in April 2013 remains to be seen.
nba is the worst::Heat 10-3, Knicks 9-3.  Knicks 104, Heat 84.  The heat are the ones that are  "putting the NY Knicks in the same category", silly...
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Jeez, the Knicks are playing like freaks.
nocs4eva::Knicks got this
nocs4eva::What's p. Knicks giotto this
knickstape82::just remember this we dont have our 2nd best player and our best defensive player
The_Spaz_LA::Amare probably can't make them better than they already are and you've already got your last year's DPOY.  Shump can defend, but Tyson is more of an anchor than anyone in the league not named Dwight.  Also, Kidd has been really good on D, so Shump and Stat returning won't give the Knicks much of a boost, though I may be wrong, but do they really need a boost at this point?
rbermea::This wasn't a game. It was a statement. Knicks are gonna rule New York, not the Nets. The Nets can go move back to the Jersey Shore back to New Jersey! We don't want two New York teams in the NBA. There should be one New York NBA team, and that's the Knicks! Fight for NY: Round 1. Knicks 115, Nets 98.
DavidAGledhill::Hard to make a game against one of the worst teams in the league a statement game.  And yes, I'm a Pistons fan.
gstolls1967::I've been following a system for betting lately called SportsbettingStar. In only two months time I have averaged $3,000 a month profit. I found this system on the first page of Google by searching the words Online Betting System.  I hope this post helps anyone out there that might be looking for an easy way to make extra income like I was
luckeyes4u::great game by Charlie and Prince, like a combined -35. the pistons are just bad.
x_chip_douglas_x::bobcats&gt; knicks
mcook813::The Knicks are living by the 3 ball. That never wins championships.
i came for cheese::<b>there are those nights when you are shooting bricks, it's just how you find a way to score..so 3 point shooting teams will have that on some nights.but right now the knicks are making those 3s so good for them at this time.</b>
mms557::Mavs?
i came for cheese::they look like the orlando magic few years ago.relied heavily on 3 pointers.but a good weapon if they make it though.
Lakermagicshowtime::And what happened to that team once it got to the finals?GOT TRASHED
johndomenow::check out this cool shot! haha for fun  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ItMCluuCC4
meatpacker15::The Knicks live and die with Steve Novak.  If he can't shoot they lose and if the can, they win.
Gmenftw::false. this is only the second game that he's scored double digits. you sound like an idiot...
jasondmce1978::Nice to see Sheed contributing for you guys.  He was an absolute bum when he was with the Celtics.
dwade grater den jordan::ny nix sux still \ FACT
Spursdc::J.R Smith is a reptile. He has to live the rest of his life with all that mess on his body
FREETEBOW::Jared Jeffries &gt; Tyson Chandler
screamingreenz::Knicks are too old.  The 82 game season will catch up with their roster.
Dr.Jones77::Heat will beat the Knicks 4-2 in the playoffs.
barcodedlife::The knicks will humiliate the heat in the playoffs, if they meet.
Khaos0924::wow, you are that confident huh?  Barring injuries from both teams, it will be a terrifc series, won't be 4-1 for sure.
castillo364::lol i know the reason to melos success...it cause hes not forced to share the ball. last year when amare was out and lin was out he was on fire. but when they came back his stats drop alot... i bet money that when amare get back it will happen again. hes the Go-to guy to score atm.... these analyst can say what they want but melo is not a team player...bottom line.
DavidAGledhill::That's a lot of ifs.  Not gonna happen.
Khaos0924::If Melo can keep up his hot  shooting streak, and keep the Knicks in the top 3 seeds, and go at it against Miami to at least 7 games in the ECF.  I think he will change a lot of people's minds about his selfish image.
Mr. Bradford::The amount of 3's the Knicks put up every game is loony, but since they make so many of them, why not?
Rose let Jack drown::Who shot JR?
I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL TODAY ---::Anybody know where I can buy a Boston Celtics pre-game warm up suit, with an extra extra large cup?
Sherriann Ryan::the heat have gotten pretty lucky in a few games this year i think there record is giving them to much credit at the moment
NYSportsFan360::Im a KNicks fan and I have the Miami Heat as the best in the East, KNicks as #2 and can make the Eastern Conference Finals  Memphis currently best in West but I think Lakers can be better than them come playoff time
Sherriann Ryan::when the trade deadline passes i will make another judgment but for now i think the knicks are about the pick of the litter in the east and memphis in the west
Carbon-based::Melo sucks
NYSportsFan360::Melo is great and a MVP candidate
Sherriann Ryan::yeah pretty close
Sherriann Ryan::you can't be serious he is balling
the holy grail belongs in New York::if there was an NHL season there would be 3 championships in NY this year
Sherriann Ryan::the thing about nhl is that it is garbage
NYSportsFan360::<b>NY KNicks are great and......the NY Giants are great too  its all just great  </b>
NYSportsFan360::well the NY Giants are defending Super Bowl Champions and they are dominating tonight
Sherriann Ryan::i know, but  they have not shown a lot yet
Sherriann Ryan::the knicks are far better than the giants
