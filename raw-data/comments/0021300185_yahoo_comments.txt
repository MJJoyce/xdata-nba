The Natural::Another Rip City comeback! 9up!
Steven McCormick::With all those high-PPG shooters on Portland's team and Robin Lopez's rebounding. . . I'm surprised the Bulls got as close as they  did in this game,  Maybe this is a sign of things to come.
SWIFTSLICK::P U Chicago. Brilliant way to blow a lead. Noah not Rebounding, Deng just sitting around watching, Rose isn't helping at all. Put Hinrich in.
timeout::I like the bulls but only the ones in the financial section.
Justin::Rose needs to have limited play this season.  82 games per is just too many, given he is still not 100%.  Management of Chi-town need to limit the # of games Rose is to play this season, which is still early.  In MY opinion, I state 20 games, 10 in December and 10 in January, minutes even being limited.  February/March, THEN increase his time and should Bulls be in play-off contention, all the way in April, beyond.  To run him hard now, it's stupid.
NADALRECORD::Indiana would be a great franchise too if they had Jordan.
David::I'm trying to figure out which game was the greatest in NBA History. Was it Game 1 of the 1992 Finals or Game 6?
On the knoll::Another night, another loss for the Bulls, who now find themselves 4.5 games behind Indiana in the standings.
Ronald::Chicago stinks just like its fans.
Tony::Obama came from Chicago didn't he? Wonder if Rose will be able to keep his doctor or will he have to sign up for Obamacare too?
