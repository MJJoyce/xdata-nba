henry i::Hopefully the Mavs can pull this one and continue running a good game in their floor.  Carter was really in the zone when the second half started during their early encounter with the Nuggets.  Nowitzki,Ellis,Marion,Dalembert,Caledron and the rest of the Mavericks should all be pump up playing in this kind of situation.
Kevin L::So glad to see my Nuggets getting it together. Finally putting themselves in good position to be over .500. Let's finish off this game.
Bjetlog17::Calderon is like 41yr old injured Nash. What a joke!
fup duck::Dallas is unpredictable
fup duck::Denver played a nice game, but they sure could use Chandler to start playing better
Wake Up::The little man the Bulls gave up scored 17 and now Rose is gone, maybe forever. Stupid, stupid Bulls.
Anton::The Bulls could use Nate lol...
Conservatino::Again, Dirk failed to carry Mavs. Where are Dirk's 50-point games with high FG percentage? It seems the guards must carry the main loads right now.
Trip Seeker::So, Samuel Dalembert is the key to success for Mavs. He got hurt and Mavs can't go.
Melvin::Can anyone tell me why the Mavs seem to be having difficulty facing the Nuggets? Can't remember the last time the Mavs won (post-Carmelo era).
