Not My Problem::Boy, Hayward needs to realize he's in a contract year.
Travis J::another win, 17 and 2, still the best record in the NBA, where are all the haters tonight?
RRockit::Stephenson keeps the Pacers alive in the first half, but watch out, Paul George always shines in the second.
Dogtrainer7::Nice balanced attack considering both George and West had off shooting nights Go Pacers!
AronG::Hayward is better than paul George but since he's white and on Utah no one pays attention.
Anton::Like I said before, Stephenson is better than Paul George and this game is a clear evidence.
Chance::Pacers gonna start another streak prolly 8-9 games
Justin::and as a jazz fan its tuff to think about how the jazz drafted Gordon Hayward in 2010 and then Indiana drafted Paul George with the next pick..
Justin::the sooner Ty Corbin realizes that Gordon Hayward isn't a shooting guard, the better off this team will be.. he is a proto-typical small forward and he and the jazz could both be better if he would play his natural position
PKM::Hard to believe the Jazz can win this one.
