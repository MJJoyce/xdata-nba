Tony Anthony::Such a disappointing loss. The Wizards grabbed 15 offensive rebounds but scored only 6 second-chance points. If they converted more on their second chances they could have built a sizable lead and won easily. If you let yourselves get into a close game with a more experienced team, you're going to lose every time.
Anton::Please play Glen Rice Jr. I remember his dad was one the best shooters.
Nate W.::I'm not a Wizards fan, but I am in DC for the holidays and attended this game.  The Wizards are a decent team.  They have the right pieces and positions and have potential to be a playoff contender.  John Wall is a legit NBA PG.  They had great ball movement tonight.  They just need to knock down the open shots and improve shot selection overall.  Ariza can't shoot 3-14 if they want to win more games.
Amir::With this officiating Dallas is legit contender.
Patrick::Dirk sprained his ankle and came back MINUTES LATER. Meanwhile, Wade sits out an entire game due to "soreness".
PKM::Wizards 500 good job
Steven::Wizards just can get above the .500 mark!!
C::Who ever made this New Year's day schedule should be shot.  These games suck.  This game or Minny Vs NO are probably the best...
a j::Whitman takes Booker out when he had 19 rebounds and puts in Kevin "waste of space" Seraphin. When Booker sat down the Wizards were up by 5...and they lose by 9. Way to go Randy! What is your W-L record for your career now? 200 games under .500, isn't it???
Commenter::Both teams shooting so well ...
