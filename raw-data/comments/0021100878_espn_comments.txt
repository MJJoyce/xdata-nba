thegoidenboy18::I  think this team would be better off bringing Amare off the bench with the second team when he returns. That might be what pushes them through the first round of the playoffs.
LifeInInfrared::Jeffries and Amare play awesome together, so I like that idea.
T.E.R.P.::The Wizard's to put it mildly suck.  How did they go from playoff contender to bottom feeder in such a short time.  They couldn't win a game if they were spotted 30 points in the first quarter.   One more game and this miserable season can be put on the shelf with the past 2 seasons.
stone419::That was a good ol' fashioned beatdown last night. the wizards should be ashamed of themselves
Clayton Bigsby 23::I this team will win 73 games next season foshizzle
Elton7323::fail knicks probably has the easiest schedual in the nba and still barly above .500
Giants-Knicks-R-back::Neither of your statements  makes any sense. #1 to say the Knicks will only lose 9 games next year is really you just being bored. You embarrass the rest of us knowledgeable Knick fans. #2 Cut and paste the strength of schedule list and prove it. You can't so you won't. On top of that, you ignore 7 new CONTRIBUTING players this year, Injuries, new coach etc....learn the game before you speak up on something. You look silly.
woodyattjon::Is it just me or has Knicks defense (for whatever reason) improved under new coach?
thegoidenboy18::Their level of effort has improved. They tanked under D'Antoni to get him fired.

Thetimpanikid16::People wanna call the Knicks overrated?  13-4 since Woodson
one way21::good job woodson
oldirtyzoo::Its a NY team, haters will forever call the Knicks overrated.
chasclem288::65 points and 17 come from the free throw line.  This league needs to cut a few teams. Playoffs coming. NHL is always solid . MLB makes a tweak for more excitement..  Is there a team in the NBA that can pull a shocker in this shortened season?,( Probably the right amount of games over a longer period.) I don't think there is but it will interesting. OKC,SA,CHI,MIA.  Any others? REALLY.
truckstopface::that's the way it always is though. 4 great teams or less and the mid pack teams that "IF" they play well and got lucky they can pull off a run. The rest have no chance. Miami, Bulls, San Antonio, OKC in the first group of best bets. The Knicks and Celtics, Lakers are the only teams that has the talent to make a decent run, they get injured players back or rest some older players. This is my opinion.
asoltanizad::LA,IND and MEM

Lin_Diesel_17::Jeez man. Iman Shumpert is down too? I mean this is getting ridiculous with the injuries.
oldirtyzoo::Washington needs to get their OG name and logo back. What a god aweful logo they have: a broken arm holding a ball? Hideously ugly. Go Knicks for 6th seed!

KORNETS::UR A FRAUD, FLAGGED
KORNETS::LIKE I SAID BELOW, DONT FORGET THE NETS HAD SOME OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE VICTORIES OF THE SEASON. ON THE ROAD, YES THE ROAD, WE BEAT THE BULLS, CELTICS, SIXERS, ATLANTA, INDIANA, SAN ANTONIO, LA CLIPPERS, MEMPHIS, DALLAS, KNICKS, HOUSTON, DENVER, PHOENIX, UTAH, &amp; DENVER!! THATS EVERY TEAM CURRENTLY OVER 500 EXCEPT OKC, LAKERS (WHO WE LOST TO ON THE BUZZER IN LA ON A MIRACLE SHOT BY KOBE), MAGIC, AND HEAT!!
catplayball2::Thanks. Net beat sixers and put back Knicks to 7th. Nets keep the good work on, and beat Boston next.
New_York_For_The_Win::Yeah I would Appreciate that too
New_York_For_The_Win::Yeah and you can't beat anyone on your own Arena, and that sucks
KORNETS::HUH?
Michaelprestby65::Is your name Carlos?
AzCards09-10::I am sick of the Knicks. They suck, but are on tv everyday. They are barely above .500 in the East which is pathetic. If they were in the west, and had to play western teams they would be in the 14th spot of the west. That is great that they are from a big market, but I would rather watch a talented team than one from a big city. They get way too much coverage for a mediocre team. That being said congrats on the win. Man, poor wizard fans.
sanfranchristo::In case you haven't noticed, the "West is so much better than the East" argument has broken down over the last few years. Probably still a bit better top-to-bottom, but do you really think Clippers are better than Boston at #4? Or Houston is better than New York (now) at #7? Not to mention that the two best teams are probably Chicago and Miami (we'll see if OKC or SA get to the finals to challenge that).
KORNETS::GO NETS GUYS!!
New_York_For_The_Win::Good night too. Good luck to your team
New_York_For_The_Win::Wow you lost me. At first I thought you were a frustrated Wizards fan, Then I thought you were a frustrated Nets fan, and now you're a Suns fan. What's next??????? Heat fan?
AzCards09-10::Good night. Good luck to your teams. Go Suns!
New_York_For_The_Win::Maybe when they move to Brooklyn they will get more fans and more covarage
New_York_For_The_Win::I am from New York, But the Nets are not a Big market Nets are like the Islanders
AzCards09-10::Wow, my English was awesome in that last post...
AzCards09-10::I have stopped watching them, but without NBA league pass I get a finite amount of games I can watch every night. A lot s of port fans I have talked to feel the knicks get way to much national media. Keep playing them in their local area, but a lttle variety would be nice. The other teams that get a lot of national media attention at least deserve it. The Lakers, Miami, Boston, Chicago, Thunder are very talented and should get the attention. Knicks not so much...
RICHIEBABY617::FALSE......U have lowsports iq and small hands clown
AzCards09-10::Hopefully your nets and my suns are awesome too!
AzCards09-10::What can I say? I am an optomist!
KORNETS::AWESOME? ARE U HIGH?? LOL
AzCards09-10::I did mention that he has been on a tear lately. Before Woodson he wasn't playing super great though. I think he finally has stepped it up, but of course his numbers will be better without amare, and lin taking shots. He is the 1st second and third option on offense now. So he should be scoring a lot right now. Knick have some other great weapons too, but he is the majority of the offense right now.
New_York_For_The_Win::Melo overrated? He doesn't defend? You both clearly have not been watching the Knicks lately. Melo has been AMAZING since Woodson took the Knicks
AzCards09-10::Ya, I am not a knicks hater by any means. I root for them against most teams. I just went on a tangent because lately every time I turn on the tv the knicks are there. They have a lot of potential, but haven't been a great team this year. Maybe with a healthy amare, and the return of linsanity they will be awesome next year.
KORNETS::WE ALL KNOW HES OVERATED, HES HORRIBLE ON DEFENSE AND A BALL STOPPER, HE ISNT EVEN PRODUCTIVE U CAN GET A BETTER OFFENSIVE SET WITH BALL MOVEMENT
AzCards09-10::I just think he is overrated.
New_York_For_The_Win::Ok now I get it, you're just a Melo hater
AzCards09-10::The Knicks probably will be better next year, and if they are good I won't mind them getting the deserved attention. Fair point that they have a  few stars, but most teams do have some sort of great player like that. I like Stoudemire a lot. He was my second favorite player for about 8 years. If stoudemire was playing I wouldn't mind watching them. I am not a melo fan though. He is a selfish ball hog. Historically his teams have had better records and cohesion when he doesn't play. He has been on quite a tear recently though.
New_York_For_The_Win::The thing here is that the Knicks have superstars too, just like Lakers, Miami,Boston, Chicago and the Thunder, and that is why they get all the media Knicks will be a lot better next year though
New_York_For_The_Win::If you're sick of the Knicks just because they're on national TV almost every night, do not watch them and problem solved, and stop crying like a little girl
AzCards09-10::The nets should have a much better season next year, it it crazy how they had so many injuries. I hope lopez can stay healthy. He could be an allstar next year if he puts more effort into rebounding.
KORNETS::THANK YOU!!!! THE NETS SHOULD BE ON TV WAYYYY MORE THEY ARE STACKED TOP TO BOTTOM WITH TALENT AND IF U DON'T THINK SO READ MY POSTS RIGHT BELOW, WE UNFORTUNATELY HAD THE WORST CASE OF INJURY BUGS IN THE HISTORY OF THE LEAGUE (NO EXAGGERATION WE MADE A RECORD)!!!  NETS ARE YOUNG AND EXCITING AND NOBODY FUCKKIING KNOWS ABOUT THEM CUZ GAYYYY ASSSS ESPN DIRESPECTS THEM EVEN THO THEY ARE A BIG MARKET TEAM!!!! HOW GAAAAYYY!!!!!! N!!!!!! E!!!!!!! T!!!!!!! S!!!!!!! NETS!!!!!!!! NETS!!!!!!! NETS!!!!!!!
Michael38061::...when NJ completed their sports complex, they bought the NY Nets
Michael38061::They were the New York Nets in the NBA. They played at Nassau Coliseum in Long Island. Originally an ABA team before the merger in the early 70's
imissoakley::I stand corrected in some sense, Michael, the Nets technically did have a New York team. But in the NBA....?
Michael38061::You never heard of the New York Nets (with Dr J)?
imissoakley::As a fellow new yorker, I have to disagree. The Nets have never been considered a New York team, nor a large market team. Their move to Brooklyn may change that, however.
Thetimpanikid16::the only reason why people watch the YES network is to watch the Yankees lol get a clue....
KORNETS::NETS ARE CONSIDERED A LOCAL NEW YORK METROPOLITAN TEAM SHOWS HOW MUCH U KNOW, UR CLEARLY NOT FROM NY LOL
KORNETS::UMMM ITS NEW YORK MARKET U IDIOT, NETS ARE ON NY TV IM A NEW YORKER FROM QUEENS U TOOL!!
New_York_For_The_Win::Nets a Big market? Nice joke LOL
KORNETS::N!!!!!!!!! E!!!!!!!! T!!!!!!!!!! S!!!!!!!!!!! NETS!!!!!!!!!!! NETS!!!!!!!! NETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    BEST TEAM IN THE METRO AREA BY FAR!!!!! YOU ALL KNOW IF IT WERE NOT FOR INJURIES NETS WOULD BE CHAMPIONSHIP CONTENDER EASILY!!!!!! LOOK AT ALL OUR TALENT?????  8 STARTERS, 5 ALLSTARS, 8 GUY WHO CAN DROP 20+ ON ANY GIVIN NIGHT!!!!!!        DERON WILLIAMS, BROOK LOPEZ,  GERALD WALLACE, KRIS HUMPHRIES, MARSHON BROOKS, ANTHONY MORROW, GERALD GREEN, JORDAN FARMAR, AND EVEN MORE SOLID BENCH PLAYERS LIKE ROOKIE STUD JORDAN WILLIAMS, SHELDON WILLIAMS, DAMION JAMES, DESHAWN STEVENSON, SUNDIATA GAINES, &amp; THE JOHAN OF PETRO!!  (WELL OTHER THEN PETRO THE TEAM IS STACKED WITH TALENT, EVEN THE BOTTOM 3 PLAYERS ARE SERVICEABLE!!    OUR BENCH IS THE HIGHEST SCORING IN THE LEAGUE WHEN HEALTHY!!!  (GREEN, MORROW, FARMAR) ALL 3 OF THOSE GUYS COMBINE FOR 45-50PTS PER NIGHT AND HAVE PER'S OF  18,15,18!!!!!!!!!!!!
truckstopface::Nets don't school anyone...but hey look at it this way. Nets are always in the shot for winning the Lottery.
KORNETS::DONT FORGET THE NETS HAD SOME OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE VICTORIES OF THE SEASON.  ON THE ROAD, YES THE ROAD, WE BEAT THE BULLS, CELTICS, SIXERS, ATLANTA, INDIANA, SAN ANTONIO, LA CLIPPERS, MEMPHIS, DALLAS, KNICKS, HOUSTON, DENVER, PHOENIX, UTAH, &amp; DENVER!!  THATS EVERY TEAM CURRENTLY OVER 500 EXCEPT OKC, LAKERS (WHO WE LOST TO ON THE BUZZER IN LA ON A MIRACLE SHOT BY KOBE), MAGIC, AND HEAT!!
AzCards09-10::It would have been cool to see, and the playoff race in the East might be more interesting if more teams were in the mix.
KORNETS::I DIDNT SAY FARMAR IS AN ALLSTAR I AM JUST SAYING WE GOT TONS OF POTENTIAL AND NICE PIECES, THANK YOU FOR BEING OPEN MINDED.  IT WOULD OF BEEN SOOOO INTERESTING TO SEE THE TEAM HEALTHY!!! WHAT A SHAME!!
KORNETS::SERIOUSLY, WE HAVE SUCH A SICK TEAM HOW CAN KNICKS FANS ARGUE THAT THEY ARE EVEN CLOSE TO AS GOOD? STOP THROWING NUMBERS AROUND CUZ WE HAD AT LEAST 5 GUYS INJURED EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY GAME THIS SEASON!!!! AT LEAST 5!!!!! NOT ONE TIME DID OUR STARTERS ALL PLAY THE SAME TIME!!!! LOPEZ PLAYED A TOTAL OF 5 GAMES AND SCORED 40PTS &amp; 30PTS IN HIS ONLY 2 REGULAR MINUTE GAMES!!!  WALLACE WAS AWESOME TILL HE GOT HURT!!!! BROOKS WAS GREAT TILL HIS INJURY AND IS COMING ON STRONG TO END THE SEASON, HUMPHRIES IS AN ABSOLUTE BEAST AND EASILY BETTER THEN AMARE AT THIS STAGE OF THEIR CAREERS!! DOUBLE DOUBLE MACHINE!!!!  MORROW SCORED 42PTS BEFORE GETTING HURT!!! FARMAR HAD A CAREER YEAR AND HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST TEAM PER BEFORE GETTING HURT!!!! ONLY 1 OF 4 PGS WHEN STARTING TO AVG AT LEAST 17,7,3,1.5 ALONG WITH DWILL, CP3, &amp; JOHN WALL (&amp; FARMAR!!), GREEN IS THE MOST IMPROVED PLAYER HANDS DOWN!!! 20+PTS PER GAME AND DOMINANT FROM 3PT AND IN THE LANE AWESOME ATHLETE!!!  DWILL?? BEST PG IN THE LEAGUE HANDS DOWN!! HE GOT CP3S PASSING AND DROSES DRIVING!!! THE WHOLE TEAM IS INSANE!!!!
AzCards09-10::Agreed, knicks aren't that great. The nets weren't going to do anything this year though. They have a lot of great pieces that you pointed out, but they definitely don't have six allstars. They have deron williams who is a legit allstar. Kris humphreys is pretty good, but not quite there. Jordan farmar isn't even close, but is fun to watch.
fdavidson1106::What's your seed in the playoffs again?
KORNETS::U KNOW DAMN WELL IF WE WERE NOT PLAYING WITH A 7-8 MAN LINEUP WITH ONLY 2-3 STARTERS ALL FUCKINNNG SEASON MAYBE WE WOULD OF WON THE EAST NOT JUST MAADE THE PLAYOFFS, DEFINTELY BEEN BETTER THEN THE KNICKS AND IF U SAY NO UR STRAIGHT UP LYING OR IN DENIAL AND U KNOW IT!!!
