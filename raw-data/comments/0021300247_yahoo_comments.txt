Ralph::Let's play Giannis as much as possible.
Alfons O::Sullinger earned more PT and he is the best player on the team, he should be starting and playing the most minutes.
Steven N.::Finally the coach know what to do. Starting Henson and playing Giannis. I know Giannis is only playing because Butler is out but he deserves more playing time.
Alfons O::Looks like coach is starting his best 5 players, and giving out the PT to the best players, wasn't doing that in the first 5 games, that makes a big difference, I mean they are not going to be world beaters but not too bad ... talking Celtics here in case you were wondering.
Alfons O::Sullinger is very talented, I think he was injured most of his time with Ohio State, back problem, now that he got surgery he is looking better than ever before.
Alfons O::Sullinger moved up in the dapth chart to #1  center, still the back up forward, he is so good he can play 2 positions ;;; I am sure that's just an oversight, but then this is yahoo and the NBA. Olynyk still listed with an ankle.
Marlowe::Finally! Starting Henson!
Daniel D::Let's face it. The Celtics simply aren't as bad as everyone expected. Keep beating the teams you should beat, like the Bucks and you'll wind up with a reasonable reecord. Not spectacular or even playoff worthy but much better than the naysayers predicted. No tanking.
William::The Celtics need to keep improving and work on their consistency. I see us winning a close one! Let's go Cets!!!
Commenter::boston wins easily 95 to 75
