Brewcrewchamps::Harris has been a BEAST in the summer league!! Play him skiles!!!

yescrewpack::This is a good trade for the bucks!! Lost two position in a draft that we will get the player we want if we are picking 12 or 14. Lauer and livingston were going to sit the bench anyway! I would like to see us trade the first two picks for a proven swing man and then sign the turk!!. Feel a big season coming for the bucks!! Lets hope Skiles don't screw it up.... As bad as we normally draft do we really need to keep the string going??
yescrewpack::Have you ever really looked at who we have drafted??  This is a list of our #1 picks since 1980. No wonder we always $uck!! 2010	15	Larry Sanders	4.0	3.0	0.4 2009	10	Brandon Jennings	16.8	3.5	5.4 2008	8	Joe Alexander	4.2	1.8	0.7 2007	6	Yi Jianlian	7.9	4.9	0.7 2005	1	Andrew Bogut	12.7	9.3	2.3 2003	8	T.J. Ford	11.2	3.1	5.8 2002	13	Marcus Haislip	3.5	1.5	0.2 2000	15	Jason Collier	5.6	2.9	0.3 1998	19	Pat Garrity	7.3	2.6	0.8 1998	9	Dirk Nowitzki	22.9	8.3	2.6 1997	10	Danny Fortson	8.2	7.2	0.7 1996	4	Stephon Marbury	19.3	3.0	7.6 1995	11	Gary Trent	8.6	4.5	1.0 1994	18	Eric Mobley	0.0	0.0	0.0 1994	1	Glenn Robinson	20.7	6.1	2.7 1993	8	Vin Baker	15.0	7.4	1.9 1992	8	Todd Day	12.3	3.4	1.5 1992	23	Lee Mayberry	5.1	1.3	3.6 1991	18	Kevin Brooks	3.3	1.1	0.4 1990	16	Terry Mills	10.6	5.4	1.3 1988	13	Jeff Grayer	N/A	N/A	N/A 1986	22	Scott Skiles	N/A	N/A	N/A 1985	22	Jerry Reynolds	N/A	N/A	N/A 1984	21	Kenny Fields	N/A	N/A	N/A 1983	18	Randy Breuer	N/A	N/A	N/A 1982	20	Paul Pressey	N/A	N/A	N/A 1981	21	Alton Lister	N/A	N/A	N/A NOT VERY GOOD!!!
Brewcrewchamps::Trade the 1st and 2nd to the lakers for Gasol!! We have a great bench and all we need is a center who can pass and score! Put him with Monta and Jennings and this would be a great team! We have plenty of young guys sitting the bench already so what's the draft going to do for us??...
Road dog Red::The Tics looked REALLY good last night...bradley and Rondo make up the fastest background in the NBA....and i mean Cheetah fast..with a turbo charger strapped on his back
acefspradez::The Bucks finishing off another mediocre/sub par season.  Typical.  Not enough wins to get in the post, not enough losses to really help with some high talented draft(s).  Herb Kohl....GTFO of Milwaukee....better yet, WISCONSIN!!!   PLEASE!!!!!
acefspradez::Who knows.  I'd really like to see some consistency with this team once...consistent successful seasons that is of course. They can trade for players, fire coaches or GM's, but in Milwaukee's case...IT'S THE OWNER plain and simple.  He may be good at owning department store chains, but he stinks at owing a pro sports team.
Road dog Red::WTF was the monta Elis trade about..he didn't play last night
Road dog Red::Ryan Hollins... is he related to Ron Artest???? he's got those far away looking eyes
Road dog Red::watched the game (rerun) last night... Sean Williams is just the guy they need... Big with a high energy motor.. the Hawkss are Buzzard pie
Road dog Red::Celts win in FOUR
riverhawk20::so the c's are a 4 seed but go on the road b/c the hawks have a better record? why don't they just seed teams by record then?
History.....Buff::Pierce sprained a toe?  Get the wheelchair.  The actress is acting.
Celtics1634::You mad?

Funnyman4WI::Good job of closing out the season Milwaukee.  Seriously changes need to be made by the Bucks.
mynameisjayee::What? where? there is rondo! Play defense to rondo... uh uh! where is the ball F*CK! where where where? OMG?! Boston scores!!!!
wolrahc6::rajon rondo
Celtics198628::13-9 in the 4th quarter. The teams were so over it.  Bring on the Hawks!
Celtics198628::Rondo shot the ball once...looks like he wanted to make sure he kept the assist streak alive no matter what! ha ha Check out this Metta...World....PEACE! remix  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yow-_pJbYQ
Nebula 9::Rondo finishes the season avg. 11.7 apg.  The highest avg. since Stockton 17 years ago.
Ceddy_Bu___The___Down_South_Rap_Sumo::pabswag All the hawks have are Johnson and smith. Boston has double the weapons Atlanta has and a better defense ..................... If you think the game is that simple, you are truly clueless. Ivan Johnson, Pargo, Willie Green, T-Mac, Marvin Williams, etc. Any of those guys off the bench could go for 15 on any given night and it would be no surprise. Pargo and Green go through stretches where they cant hardly miss. Ivan is tough, gets boards and has great hands on defense. T-Mac is a good facilitator. Marvin Williams has good perimeter defense and can have a hot streak with his jumper as well. This is not to mention Teague. He's pretty good.
celticgreen2012::Yes but those are just role players. Just naming names. Like Bass Stiemsma Pavlovic, Daniels, Moore, Johnason Hollins, Dooling, Bradley. And Tmac is washed up, much less of a contributor then KG, Allen, and Pierce are to the Celtics.
J-SMOOVE2077::hawks in 7 in a thrilla in manilla
IN NOOBS WE TRUST::HOW GOOD WOULD THE CELTICS BE IF THEY HAD JEFF GREEN
lakersthebestever::y did the boston celtics start their best players u should rest them
celticgreen2012::everyone is overrating Jeff Green. i was not impressed by him last year.
cArmAkAze::Rondo doesn't even have to shoot to dominate the box score.
crolson1964::Can we now fire Skiles please!
Kingofsports4843::RONDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BITCHESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
sportsfreak33555::Last chance at that title celtics...Do work
nickrmorello::Home court is in boston, for idiots who keep thinking otherwise, boston won the division!
sportsfreak33555::Its definetly boston jabroni
nickrmorello::how can i 5 seed have homecourt over a 4, this is why i dont watch monkey ball
celticgreen2012::all about the records, goofy rule I know because the Celtics are the 4 seed, but oh well, It will be a tough series, but the Celts will probably win it.
broncomike7562::Actuallu, the Hawks have the home court, because they finished with a better record than us, even though we're "seeded" higher, because we won the division.  Doesn't matter!  We'll still win the series in 6!
celticgreen2012::HC is in Atlanta. Get your facts straight. ATL has the better record, they get HC.
Nebula9x.::No.
celticgreen2012::Ray Allen is probable for game 1 according to Doc.
broncomike7562::That's great news!
MattRamsayMoore::Wow, what was the point of even playing KG at all if you're just gonna play him 11 minutes? Doc completely destroyed KG's #s for the year with this one stupid decision.
J-SMOOVE2077::the key is to get this thing to a game 7 in the ATL.
freebird1963::Key is to score more points then the opponent. What a dumb $@% you are.
happy8pril::Always fun to see a crazy-ass Rondo stat-line.
taco guy99::when do you think game 3 is gonna be?
pabswag::Boston is in year 5 of a 3 year deal. It is now or never. Heat? no problem. Bulls? got nothing. Banner 18 this year for the Celtics. Can't waste time celebrating home court advantage. The Celtics could have easily had it in the first round, but we have starters to rest and another banner to win.
nickrmorello::celtics do have home court, and have for awhile, since winning the division
Chocolate_Thunder.::I was hoping Rondo would not play short minutes to keep his assist streak alive.  Looks like he can still drop 15 dimes in short minutes.
PP owns Rondo::Boston will sweep Atlanta
Chocolate_Thunder.::Not sure about that
ima brave falcon hawk::the hawks are gonna have lots of fans come play off time you will see http://youtu.be/oypKKIvoHYg
pabswag::Good joke
PP owns Rondo::Even though the games are in Atlanta, there are usually more C's fans at Phillips Arena than Hawks fans.
pabswag::Hawks fans can't afford the tickets!
J-SMOOVE2077::i dont know if boston fans know this, but we have been playing without horford for over 3 months now.  im not saying we are better without him, im just saying we have adjusted well to being without him and won a good many games without him as well.
DJCJMastaFlex::^did this guy just say Ray Allen has no Offense? LOL da faqqqqq he holds most 3 pointers cause he has no O ok kiddos
pabswag::Because he is slow, and has no offense.... Of course your better without him. Still not as good as Boston
celticgreen2012::Celtics have a better record without Allen then with him, and hes not ruled out yet, so the jokes on you.
pabswag::Home court is the only things Hawks fans can celebrate. It's not like they will beat Boston in the first round
nickrmorello::lol how do the hawks get homecourt idiot, celtics won division
pabswag::last year the Knicks tickets sold out against Boston in the first round and how did that go?
ima brave falcon hawk::the hawks are gonna have lots of fans come play off time you will  see http://youtu.be/oypKKIvoHYg
PP owns Rondo::The Hawks don't have enough weapons to contend with Boston.
pabswag::All the hawks have are Johnson and smith. Boston has double the weapons Atlanta has and a better defense
ima brave falcon hawk::you sound ignorant
J-SMOOVE2077::ray allen is hurt
PP owns Rondo::Horford is hurt.
celticgreen2012::Allen will play if he can, he is not out yet like your lover Horford. u mad?
INTERSTATE_20GA::HAWKS!! Can't to see Teague own Rondo again!!!!
pabswag::"who's Teague? that guy is a nobody"- Kevin Garnett
celticgreen2012::*wait.
celticgreen2012::No problem, and LOL at Teague owning Rondo. not happening.
INTERSTATE_20GA::Thanks
cchar042::What is the record for most assists in a game without scoring a single point?
Celtics1634::27
pabswag::record will be broken by rondo someday
cchar042::John Lucas with 0 pts, 0 reb, 24 ast
Cubswin56::http://gifura.orzhk.org/src/1332235315120.swf  rondo postgame interview!
J-SMOOVE2077::HOMECOURT IS IN THE ATL SNITCHES!!!!!!
nickrmorello::who court is boston idiot, celtics won division!
PP owns Rondo::Who cares? Boston will sweep or win in 5.
celticgreen2012::too bad your boyfriend Horford is out.
celticgreen2012::yeah they will have more time together now at least.
Celtics1634::Are they dating?
Celtics1634::You mad?
Teletubbie2012::means nothing
celticgreen2012::Cam Newton &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tim Tebow
freebird1963::Who cares but Panther losers.
Kirk-Is-My-Hinrich::Is Pierce ok?
Celtics1634::Out for the playoffs
palmervia::Wizards beat Heat by 34
Teletubbie2012::Wizards &gt;&gt; Heat
PP owns Rondo::Kuechly was the best tackling linebacker in the nation last year.
PP owns Rondo::Cam &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your team's favorite QB
celticgreen2012::Brady, P. Manning, Rodgers, Brees, Roethlisberger, Ryan, Stafford, E. Manning, Rivers  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cam   He still has a lot to prove
PP owns Rondo::I agree with this, especially your comments about Tebow.
celticgreen2012::Ok I will give it to you that Stafford and maybe Ryan might be equal, but Rivers has been in the league long enough to be better at this point. Cam is a beast though, much better then this goof Tebow we are force-fed daily.
Jimmy30313::Brees is the best IMO
PP owns Rondo::Ryan, Stafford, and Rivers are not greater than Cam.
PP owns Rondo::Thanks BC fans for my new linebacker Luke Kuechly! Wooooo! Carolina's defense will be nasty next year.
Celtics1634::Perhaps, but not just because of him.  There better be some pieces in place already.  But yes, he is excellent.  I'm in a keeper fantasy league.  About to trade Tom Brady for Cam Newton!
pabswag::An inconsistent Fantasy beast. Keep Brady!!!
PP owns Rondo::smart move. Cam is a fantasy beast.
