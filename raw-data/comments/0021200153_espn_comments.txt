FootballKingFrans::at least with scola we had a better record
Feces Pantalones::Why would you pay a guy 25 million and another 80 million to NOT be play off contenders?  Absurd.  Irrational. That thought belongs in the pantalones.
1PKr::I could give this team five years and they still wouldn't be playoff contenders. Get real.
NguyenDragon::The team is young... I am not sure why people are having a hard time understanding...
rEdBuLxTaSy::READ AGAIN SMARTA$$!  I NEVER MADE A COMPARISON BASED ON TALENTS BUT RATHER A RESEMBLANCE OF THE USUAL "OBSESSED HATERS" WHOM WILL ALWAYS HATE.    BY THE WAY, LBJ COULDN'T FINISH IN THE PLAYOFF FINALS WITH THE CAVALIERS OVER A 7 YEAR SPAN AND ONLY ACHIEVED THAT WITH THE HEAT IN 2 YEARS. THIS SIMPLY REFUTED THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW A GAME SYSTEM, COACH OR TEAM MATE HAVE NO RELEVANCE TO A PLAYER'S STRENGTH.
Feces Pantalones::^^^ This guy just compared what the Rockets have to LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh.  That team had a implosion the FIRST year and then won.  Not three years but one year.  The Rockets have no where near that type of talent on any end of the color spectrum.  It aint racist, its just a fact.  You just can't take bench players and pay them millions and expect them to learn to beat stars.
rEdBuLxTaSy::IT'S THE SAME BS PEOPLE WERE GIVING LBJ AND THE HEAT WHEN THEY CHOKE DURING THE PLAYOFFS.  IT TOOK THEM 3 YEARS TO GET IT RIGHT.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCES WITH THE ROCKETS IS THE HATINGS ARE MORE INTENSE AND RACIST :)
pistol111847::I agree. Actually they paid 2 guys 25 million and 1 guy 80 million. Nice point crappy pants.
pistol111847::I was a Knicks fan for 50 years until Carmelo acted like a spoiled brat last year and got away with it. First he tanked games because he didn't agree with the offense. Then he got D'Antoni fired. Then he criticized Lin's contract with Houston. I'm sorry but you don't criticize other player's contracts no matter what you think. There's no way I can support such conduct and I think if the Knicks organization had any balls they would have substantially fined him. This is a problem with the whole NBA in particular - the star players have too much power.
SjGMEN77::JEREMY WHO?
rEdBuLxTaSy::SAYS WHO?    P.S.  HOW'S THAT FOR HUMOR? :)
bmoreborn777::Its funny how die hard Lin fans are so transparent, If half of you took your heads outa Lin's a$$ just for a second you would realize that alot of these so called HATERZ were saying Lin would just be average from the start. But for some reason you guys couldn't handle that thought, So you had to feed into the hype and called anyone who thought otherwise a hater or a racist. So after hyping Lin as if he was the second coming and now that its not playing out as you wanted  you want people view lin as some rookie with a little experiance. When will you realize you morons created this situation. You just couldn't let Lin have a normal and decent career you just to feed into the hype and that will be Lins dowfall.
RNYC::Dude no real Knick fan or anyone with any type of basketball sense would ever advocate that silliness.  You live in a world devoid of any facts.  BTW you see who's gone and whose there right?  Melo furthermore, mgmt felt Felton was a better fit that tells you all you need to know.
rEdBuLxTaSy::YOU SHOULD BE GLAD LINSANITY INSPIRED MELO TO PLAY TEAM BALL THIS YEAR.  OTHERWISE THE KNICKS WOULD STILL BE IRRELEVANT HAHA :)
RNYC::You say Lin fans are modest.  I guess you missed all the "Trade Melo and Stat and build around Lin" talk last year on Knicks boards. Modesty is advocating to trade 2 all stars for a PG who has played 25 games?  8 stong ones?  Or maybe you were the prime culprit and now you'd like to temper expectations based on how mediocre he's proving himself to the more he plays.
rEdBuLxTaSy::THOSE CALLING FOR MELO'S HEAD WERE REAL KNICK FANS WHOM WERE VERY DISSATISFIED AFTER MELO CAME BACK AND TANKED ON PURPOSE BECAUSE HE WAS JEALOUS OF LINSANITY TAKING THE SPOTLIGHT FROM HIM.  BUT OF COURSE ALL THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS TRANSLATED THAT INTO "OH LIN'S BETTER" AND BEGAN BASHING THE LIN FANS.  IT'S OBVIOUS WHEN WOODY TOOK OVER, MELO BECAME THE HAPPIEST SUPERBUM IN THE LEAGUE. :)
RNYC::NO ONE expects the rockets to be playoff contenders.  You keep saying that to make yourself feel better.  If anything on that team Lin's numbers should be fantastic whether or not they make the playoffs is irrelevant
rEdBuLxTaSy::HERE'S ANOTHER TROLL DOING THE LIN BAITING AGAIN HAHAHA:)  P.S. READ MY COMMENTS ABOVE AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I MEAN
rEdBuLxTaSy::BTW, IF YOU ACTUALLY TAKE THE TIME TO READ ALL THE IRRATIONAL RANTS BY OBSESSED LIN HATERS, YOU WOULD REALIZED THAT THEY'RE EVEN WORST THAN THE LIN FANS CAUSE MOST OF THEIR COMMENTS ARE VERY RACIST, CONTRADICTORY AND LACKS MERIT.
rEdBuLxTaSy::CORRECTION, MOST LIN FANS ARE MODEST AND THEY DONT' EXPECT LIN TO BE AN ELITE PG.  THEY'RE ONLY SUGGESTING THAT WITH THE RIGHT SYSTEM, LIN HAS SHOWN THAT HE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE AN ABOVE AVERAGE PG DOWN THE STRETCH.  NOW WHAT PART OF THAT DO YOU HATERS NOT UNDERSTAND?  PLEASE KNOW THE DIFFERENCES!    HOWEVER WHAT'S FUNNY IS THAT MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE SETTING THE BAR VERY HIGH FOR LIN AND THEY'RE HOPING HE FAILS, JUST TO GET THEIR POINT ACROSS.  THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE DELUSIONAL AND MISGUIDED.  :):):):)  BTW, ROCKETS ARE IN REBUILDING MODE WITH MOSTLY YOUNG ROOKIES.  ANYONE EXPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYOFF CONTENDERS NEED TO HAVE THEIR HEAD EXAMINE.  :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::BTW, ALOT OF OBSESSED LIN HATERS DON'T BELIEVED LIN DESERVED HIS CONTRACT AND THAT'S FINE BUT TO CALL HIM A SCRUB IS ANOTHER STORY.  LIN CERTAINLY HAVE THE TALENT TO BE A GOOD PG.  HOWEVER IF  HIS TALENTS ARE NOT UTILIZE CORRECTLY, IT'S EXPECTED HE WILL NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE.
rEdBuLxTaSy::CORRECTION, YOU INSISTED THE LAST 13 GAMES BY LIN WERE IN DECLINED.  I SIMPLY REFUTED THAT BY STATING THE FACTS ; IT WAS EXPECTED THAT LIN'S STATS WOULD GO DOWN ONCE MELO CAME BACK FROM INJURY, BUSTING THE MYTH THAT LIN WAS IN DECLINED.  WITH REGARDS TO LIN PLAYING WITH THE YOUNG ROOKIES, ASIK IS NOT AS GOOD A P&amp;R GUY AS TYSON WAS.  LIN DID GREAT IN NY BECAUSE TYSON WAS SOLID ON THE BOARDS.  LIN PLAYED AGGRESSIVE, CUT AND SLASH THROUGH THE LANES AND WHEN THE LANES GOT CLOGGED,  HE WOULD SIMPLY DISH IT OUT TO THE PERIMETER GUYS FOR AN EASY BUCKET.  WITH THE ROCKETS, IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.  MOST OF THE GUYS ARE YOUNG ROOKIES AND WHEN YOU HAVE A GUY LIKE HARDEN COME IN WITH SIMILAR SKILL SETS/PLAYS, LIN'S EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE REDUCED CAUSE THAT'S HIS BREAD AND BUTTER.    NOW BACK TO LIN'S CURRENT PERFORMANCE...I HAD ALWAYS AGREED THAT LIN'S ON A SHOOTING SLUMP THIS SEASON.  EVER SINCE KNEE SURGERY, HE'S LOST SOME OF HIS EXPLOSIVENESS AND SHOOTING RYTYHM.  HOWEVER IT'S NAIVE TO THINK HE CAN'T IMPROVE ON THAT DOWN THE ROAD ONCE HIS CONFIDENCE COMES BACK.  WHAT HE LACK IN OFFENSE, HE MAKES UP PRETTY GOOD ON THE DEFENSIVE END.  (REBS, AST, STLS, BLKS, ETC)
karelp::Let me summarize the positions you've taken on this board.  You've said that Lin's stats went down when he played with stars.  You've also claimed his stats are down because he plays with a bunch of rookies.  I guess you must think Lin would be great playing with a bunch of mediocre veterans then.  Good players play well regardless of the teammates they have.  With Lin, the recent evidence suggests Lin can't play well with any teammates.
bmoreborn777::And i feel sorry for Lin because a large ammount of his fans put him on a high pedestal im afraid he will never live up to the hype.
pistol111847::To start the season with Melo last year the Knicks were 7-13. Then when he came back they lost 7 in a row because he was having a jealousy fit. That makes them 7-20 with Melo. Then when Amare and Lin were hurt and Melo had the whole show to himself they did go 18-6. That means with Melo they were 25-26 last year and OUT of the PLAOFFS....more User ID:http://sportsnation.espn.go.com/fans/pistol111847
RNYC::It is amazing how you continuously like your own off base comments.
rEdBuLxTaSy::HAHAHA IT'S GONA TAKE MORE THAN WINDEX TO HELP CLEAN OBSESSED LIN HATERS FOGGY GOGGLES :):):)
eightbitme::Lin is a serviceable point guard.  I would say he's on Ramon Sessions level.  Maybe.  :-)
Feces Pantalones::No one is hating on Lin.  People are too busy laughing at his game and his fans.  25 million for an average player at best....time to Linquidate.
pistol111847::I'm laughing at your crappy pants..
pistol111847::your login name should be embarrasing - To YOU!
pistol111847::"now" pantalones. Your pants reek and so do your comments.
Feces Pantalones::and your man crush on Lin is embarrassing
pistol111847::Don't smell know but your  pantalones reek
Feces Pantalones::Why would I smell "know"?
pistol111847::Last year a lot of people were saying Lin shouldn't be getting all that money after only 25 games. Now they are saying he sucks after only 10 games. Lin haters are not consistent or objective.  Worth repeating
Vai2012::Jertemy's contribution in relation to his paycheck..............."Linadequate"
pistol111847::Lin haters and baiters are not offering any constructive criticism or intelligence to this conversation. They act like the Rockets problems are all due to Lin which is just stupid. Sure he's not shooting well but his all around game outweighs his shooting problems. He's being paid more to pass (he is a PG remember) than to shoot. There are plenty of shortcomings by all and the coaching staff but they are young and have good potential.
RNYC::They also wouldn't have been in the playoffs without the 18-6, record in the last 24 games.  That was more instrumental.
rEdBuLxTaSy::IT'S POINTLESS TO TRY AND CONDUCT A "CONSTRUCTIVE" DEBATE WITH OBSESSED LIN HATERS.  IT'S LIKE TRYING TO TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS :):):)
pistol111847::To start the season with Melo last year they were 7-13. Then when he came back they lost 7 in a row because he was having a jealousy fit. That makes them 7-20 with Melo. Then when Amare and Lin were hurt and Melo had the whole show to himself they did fo 18-6. That means with Melo they were 25-26 last year and OUT of the PLAOFFS.
palsy360::that's right coach woodson
pistol111847::But you are ignoring certain facts which is hypocrisy. Knicks would not have been in the playoffs last year without Lin. Went from 7-13 to 14-13 with him starting.
palsy360::lin helped so did shumpert, chandler,melo,jefferies,fields (some what),smith,harrelson and don't forget novak. he did'nt do it by him self he needed the other guys to help out too . melo is the reason they made the playoffs. he had the best month of april than any other player
RNYC::the season is longer than 7 games.  That's the whole point.  The longer he plays the worse he gets.  What part of that are you missing?
pistol111847::I think you're a tad obsessive on Lin
RNYC::nah, I actually just like to debate facts.  I hate dogma and hypocrisy.
RNYC::Constructive, everyone including Lin can see what he needs to work on.  Its not going to be easy.  The issue as you continue to forget was the incessant media hype and then Lin fans claiming that he was the Knicks savior after 8 games and a desire for the Knicks to tear it all down and build around Lin, instead of recognizing the teams issues lied with D'Antoni's coaching (or lack thereof).  Again Woodson had the same roster and went 18-6.  So that tells me it was D'Antoni's rigidness.  Melo is playing the 4 and the 3 this season and the Knicks are 7-1.  He rotated in the 4 spot last April while Amare was out and averaged 30-9 on 50% shooting.  D'Antoni had Melo running the PG at times which is why Melo went to D'Antoni and asked him to play Lin.  But Lin lovers forget all of this and think  Lin was the second coming.  So all of this criticism is rooted in his current play and his fans obnoxiousness on Knicks boards all last season
rEdBuLxTaSy::OBSESSED LIN HATERS LOVE TO FORGET THAT MELO DOGGED UNDER DANTONI SO THEY WENT ON A 6 GAME LOSING STREAK.  EVEN MELO ADMITTED TO THIS SO HE WOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOU IF YOU SUGGEST OTHERWISE.  ONCE WOODY TOOK OVER, MELO BECAME THE OFFENSIVE POINT AND  GOT SO JOLLY JOLLY ABOUT IT THAT HE STARTED HUSTLING VERY HARD IN HIS NEW ROLE.  IT WAS EXPECTED THAT LIN'S STAT SHEET WOULD GO DOWN WITH MELO/STATS COMING BACK FROM INJURY BUT OBSESSED LIN HATERS LOVE TO BE SELECTIVE AND DISREGARD THIS IMPORTANT FACTOR. THIS DEBUNKED THE MYTH THAT LIN WAS GETTING WORSE.   THEN IN APRIL WHEN LIN/STATS SAT OUT DUE INJURY, MELO BEGAN HUSTLING REALLY HARD BECAUSE HE NO LONGER HAVE LIN TO BLAME AND HIS REPUTATION WAS ON THE LINE.  MELO LOVERS WERE SO HAPPY THAT LIN WAS OUT DUE TO INJURY AND EVEN SUGGESTED BDAVIS/MELO WAS THE MEN TO TAKE THEM TO THE PROMISE LAND.  THEN THE HEAT SERIES CAME AND THE LOOK ON OBSESSED LIN HATERS FACE  ----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   P:)R:)I:)C:)E:)L:)E:)S:)S:) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
piper at the gates of dawn::black ppl hating on lin have no idea how stupid they sound.. its one of the more hilarious things ive witnessed recently
Vai2012::a solly attempt to be provacative.......nice tly
pistol111847::a black baiter?? Not fair - only Lin baiters are allowed.
RNYC::you're just trying to incite comments. Weak
BXwarriorBX::Looks like LInsanity will fade into nothingness..well atleast the boy got himelf a good check off that 4-6 week buzz he created....unbelievable how quickly we anoint these people as 'great' players these days..
pistol111847::Last year a lot of people were saying Lin shouldn't be getting all that money after only 25 games. Now they are saying he sucks after only 10 games. Lin haters are not consistent or objective.
rEdBuLxTaSy::WELL CONSIDERING 90% OF THE BUMS IN THE LEAGUE ARE OVERPAID...WHY NOT?!  :):):)
BXwarriorBX::felton is 205 pounds lin is 200 pounds fat jokes are stupid felton is just a better pg than lin plain and simple
RNYC::After melo came back right.    18-6 with Woodson, Melo averaging 30 and 9.  D'Antoni was the issue NOT Melo.  If anything Lin should be beasting now since Melo slowed him down right?  He's not why? B/c he caught lightning in a bottle
rEdBuLxTaSy::SUPERSTARS PLAY THEIR HEART OUT REGARDLESS OF THE COACH OR THEIR TEAM MATES.  MELO IS A SUPERBUM DRAMA QUEEN, WHO CAN'T HANDLE A LITTLE BIT OF JEALOUSY :)
NguyenDragon::Wait until he gasses out by mid season...
rEdBuLxTaSy::REAL CLEVER...COMPARING A 8 YEAR VET TO A KINDERGARTEN :):):)  P.S. FELTON PLAYS WITH VETS...LIN PLAY WITH ROOKIES :)
karelp::So anyone who brings up evidence that Lin is overrated and has played poorly is a racist?  Nice...you're a jerk, and the biggest sign of that is you have to type in all-caps to make a pathetic attempt at sounding important and authoritative.  BTW, sure hating a player based on his race is racist, but thinking one is better than he really is based on race is also racist. I personally don't look at ethnicity or heritage when I evaluate players.  Sure I'd like to think my own countrymates like Jan Vesely are great players, but they're just not. Those who think Lin is great just because he has a Chinese/Taiwanese background are off base.  The bottom line is, Lin has played really poorly over the last 23 games...most likely, the league has adjusted to his play.  If he doesn't make adjustements, he will continue to play poorly.
rEdBuLxTaSy::TELL THAT TO THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS. IF YOU ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION, YOU WOULD REALIZED THEY'RE THE MOST RACIST, IRRATIONAL, OBNOXIOUS FANS OUT THERE.  AND IF YOU CAN'T SEE THAT, THEN YOU'RE JUST AS BIASED AS THEY ARE  LOL:)
bmoreborn777::@redBuLxTasy Man are you even a basketball fan, because everywere i go i have the joy of reading your rediculous comments. Not once have you had a valid argument, your either up Lin's $@% non stop, blaming Melo off of speculation, or being a contradictious racist. Im all for liking Lin but idiots like you doesn't help at all. Why don't you leave basketball to real fans because you sir are a pretender. Now please reply with more bias crap about Melo or black people lol.
rEdBuLxTaSy::MELO EVEN ADMITTED HE DIDN'T HUSTLE AS HARD DURING LINSANITY...HE WOULD BE ASHAMED IF YOU SUGGEST OTHERWISE.  WHAT PART OF THAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?  WITH THE RIGHT PIECES, LIN COULD EASILY BE AN ABOVE AVERAGE PG. :):):)
karelp::No matter what someone says, you have an excuse.  I provided sound data, and you provide a bunch of biased and subjective BS.  BTW, Melo has nothing to do with Lin's well-below-average defense, no does he?
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND OBSESSED LIN HATERS ALWAYS LEAVE OUT THE FACT THAT THOSE GAMES WERE AFTER MELO CAME BACK AND TANKED PURPOSELY CAUSE HIS FEELINGS GOT HURT AND HAD EGO ISSUES WITH STATS :)  P.S. PLEASE CONTINUE TO AMUSE ME :)
karelp::Well, he was pretty bad the last 13 games last year while playing with vets.  He shot 40% and had a terrible assist-to-turnover ratioof 1.65.  It's more likely the league has just figured him out, and if he can't make adjustments, he won't amount to much.
Yourdaddy4598::Bricksanity!!!!!!!
pistol111847::you may be ignorant but you are pretty clever - I'll give you that
pistol111847::Hey sources learn to spell ....  BAIT not BATE. Ignorant SOB
NguyenDragon::sources says - you pay for insider but i'm ignorant lol  If he has the money to do so why not...
sources says::you pay for insider but i'm ignorant lol
pistol111847::You like that don't ya? Think you're clever baiting Lin lovers don't ya?? Yourdaddy is more like yourmama!
sources says::sounds like he did bate a Lin lover
cscobra::Surprise surprise Lin showing he was not worth a monster contract...lol who is going to pay 15 mil for the most average point guard in the league. Another way to put it is, the Knicks and their fans are bragging about the awesomeness that is Raymond Felton lol
pistol111847::Caught ya Lin lover baiter!!
NguyenDragon::Its been 10 games...
karelp::You know what @rE, get back to me when you can actually put a coherent sentence toghether.   You just wrote somee mindless and biased garbage that one needs an interpreter to understand.
rEdBuLxTaSy::UP MEAN THE LAST 13 GAMES WITH MELO, THE BALL STOPPER?  WITH MELO/STATS COMING BACK, IT WAS EXPECTED TO HAVE LIN'S STATS GO DOWN.  IS HE NOT A PG?  STOP FLIPPING THE SWITCH...YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH REALITY :):):)
karelp::Yeah, it's been 10 games plus the terrible last 13 games of last season...that's now a total of 23 games.  It looks to me more like the league has figured him out...he needs to make adjustmens, and if he can't, he'll be one of the worst PGs in the league and/or on the bench.
rEdBuLxTaSy::AND 9 GAMES IS ENOUGH TO CONVINCE YOU HE IS NOT WORTH IT? :):):)  P.S.  JUST GOTTA LOVE OBSESSED LIN HATERS =           H:)Y:)P:)O:)C:)R:)I:)T:)E:)
NguyenDragon::sources says - And 20 games was enough to convince you he is worth it  I didn't pay for his salary... Les Alexander isn't complaining so why should you?
sources says::And 20 games was enough to convince you he is worth it
pistol111847::The coaching and the bench have cost the Rockets dearly. They have lost a lot of close games and when you have a backup point guard playing crunch time minutes you will lose those close games.
NguyenDragon::Especially one named Toney Douglas... Release this guy and promote Machado already...
Crooklynism::Im tired of people picking on Lin for his  play, he's the kind of PG that will only be as good as the team around him, thats it, if he was with my Knicks right now he'll probably be averaging 4 more points, 4 more assists and a better FG%
sources says::If he was on my Knicks, there would be way more pressure. that air ball would had him in depression. He would choose not to play at 85%
NYCSportsFan22::lol excuses
NguyenDragon::I figured you knew more about basketball... Apparently I was wrong... Obviously his shooting percentage needs to improve but his strength is handling and dishing the ball...
NguyenDragon::Its obvious Rockets style does not play to his strength... So why the hell did we get him?  Bring in a new coach already...
pistol111847::Why on earth did Sampson pull Lin out of the game with 6 minutes left in the 3rd quarter and the Rockets on a roll?? What is going on??? And why did Lin sit the whole OT against Portland? Anyone see a pattern here?
Swish3And1::Sampson is clueless, he is the worst interim coach of the year.
pistol111847::Maybe he is betting on games...
NguyenDragon::Sampson is a dumbas.s.... I see no other logical  explanation...
President of TROLLS::Bricksanity!!!!!!!
RNYC::Amazing people want to credit Lin with Melos resurgence. The problem was D'antoni not Melo. The knicks are 25-7 under Woodson. That includes 18-6 last season when Melo avg 30 and 9 while carrying the Knicks to the playoffs. It's this type of lunacy that Lin fans refuse to look at.  Last year there were numerous "Trade Melo and build around Lin" post. Stupid
RNYC::That's your opinion and your right to have one, but he's also more integral than Lin and every GM in the league would take him first except for maybe you.    Funny thing is Melo lobbied for Lin to play.
parafal::not arguing for Lin ... Melo is better then Lin no doubt... just saying i wouldnt touch Melo   Huge talent (could be top five talent wise) but after 7+ years he is what he is (dominique wilkens with a poor attitude)
parafal::melo is a self centered head case, with lots of talent and no heart... that will never win a championship
pistol111847::Melo only got the coach fired and called Lin's contract "ridiculous". Whether you agree that Lin's contract was "ridiculous" or not I've never seen another player knock someone's contract. Melo shold have never done that.
sources says::Chandler said that contract was stupid
RNYC::So when the coach is misusing the talent he shouldn't be fired?  You don't think Kobe got Mike Brown fired?  Magic got Paul Westphal fired?  If NE hires an OC that runs the ball instead of passing with Brady. I'm sure he'd be fired to.  The facts are the facts and the record under Woodson is a direct indictment of D'Antoni's style for the talent on the roster.  18-6 under Woodson with the EXACT same roster
Swish3And1::I thought Lin played pretty good today. At one point offense was flowing well and Rockets about to cut the deficit to single digit in 3rd, with other players starting to feel it..... Then what happened, the interim coach benched Lin!!!  Momentum was gone and Jazz later closed out the 4th quarter.    But looking ahead, time is running out for Lin to find his shooting touch. Who cares just start to shoot more, rather than keep passing to Asik!!  Asik is great at rebounding but he sure got slippery hands. :-)
vergatease::LOL what happened to this board? Lets talk about the game, instead of trashing on Lin, James Harden was out and the Jazz were out for blood on this one. The last few posts have been Lin trash talk but did any haters realize the Jazz are near impossible to beat at home. Did you know that they are only 1 of 3 teams undefeated at home? Heat, Knicks, Jazz. This Rockets team is young but they are promising, Lin is good, they just need to make adjustments with him and Harden if these two are going to co exist together. You also have to consider these players haven't been together that long, you have to build chemistry and players need to bond.
pistol111847::Not only was Harden out but his backup Delfino was injured.
vergatease::edit
Laughs2006::Rockets are an average and  will not make the playoffs....its hard in the west anyway....all this Lin stuff is silly though any knowledgeable fan could see he was an average player that had a great run...The problem came when his fans attempted to convince us that he was better than melo and one of the best pgs in the nba. Then started whining when the knicks would not match an offer that pays him max money in the 3rd year which he has not earned at all not surprised at all by his sucess or lack there of if the rockets wanted him to succeed they should have gotten their hands on d antoni.
pistol111847::Interim coach keeps yanking Lin even when he and the team are playing well.
Laughs2006::Im sorry that you bought the hype man its a shame.
rEdBuLxTaSy::ITS NEVER A SHAME WHEN BILLIONS FOUND BBALL ENTERTAINING TO WATCH.  EVEN MELO BOUGHT INTO THE HYPE AND IS PLAYING TEAM BALL NOW :):):)
Laughs2006::LOL ur crazy bro.....as i previously houston blew it they should have signed dantoni with lin he is like steriods for pgs because the ball is always in the pgs hands. but since they didnt they are stuck with a ridiculous contract and a very average player. i apologize for the fact that you bought in and now your butt hurt and looking for excuses for Lins poor play...he is playing ok to me smh.
rEdBuLxTaSy::FUNNY YOU KEEP PULLING STUFF OUT OF YOUR A$$ TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER ABOUT LIN.  CONTINUED TO HATE IF YOU WISH....LIN WILL DO JUST FINE DOWN THE STRETCH.  REMEMBER THE "25 GAMES IS TOO SMALL OF A SAMPLE SIZE"?  NOW 9 GAMES INTO THE SEASON AND LIN'S A BUST?  HAHAHA YALL OBSESSED LIN HATERS NEVER FAILS TO AMUSED ME :):):):)
Bigmayne313::^^^^^^^^Sounds like a bunch of BS excuses!!
rEdBuLxTaSy::OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS BS TO THE IRRATIONAL/OBNOXIOUS OBSESSED LIN HATERS.  THEY'RE KNOWN FOR THEIR ILLOGICAL REASONING/THOUGHTS
NoonGame::almost all the great ones look average within their rookie year or only has about 30 starts...players have to go through their growing pains...
rEdBuLxTaSy::THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS INVOLVED...COMING BACK FROM KNEE SURGERY, LIN'S LOST SOME OF HIS EXPLOSIVENESS.  WHERE'S THE CUT AND SLASH PLAYER WE SEEN LAST YEAR?  NOW ALL HE USUALLY DOES IS PASS, PASS, PASS, ETC. WITH A NEW SYSTEM, NEW COACH, NEW TEAM MATES, ETC...IT'S GONA TAKE TIME FOR THEM TO MESH.
Bigmayne313::Damion Lilard from Portland looks way better than LIn, Kyrie Irving, Brandon Jennings Steph Curry looked good in their 1st 25 starts and still gettin it in, Lin it the rookie wall last year against the Heat and to me still hasnt bounced back. Stop making excuses for the bum, Mike Brown got 5 games to prove himself how long does Lin need? 5yrs? GTFOH
rEdBuLxTaSy::NAW YOU GOT IT TWISTED...THE FANS WERE CALLING FOR MELO'S HEAD BECAUSE HE TANKED PURPOSELY CAUSE HIS FEELINGS HOT HURT.  SUPERSTARS PLAY THEIR HEART OUT REGARDLESS OF THE COACH OR TEAM MATES.  MELO IS JUST A SUPERBUM STATS PADDLER.  THANKS TO LINSANITY, FAT MELO IS BUYING INTO BALL MOVEMENT THIS YEAR...THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ON TO A GOOD START.  SO KEEP HATING LOL  ROCKETS IS IN REBUILDING MODE...IF ANYONE EXPECTED THEM TO BE PLAYOFF CONTENDERS, THEY NEED TO GET THEIR HEAD EXAMINE.  IT TOOK LBJ AND THE HEAT TO GET IT RIGHT AFTER 3 YEARS.  BUT OF COURSE OBSESSED LIN HATERS CAN'T THINK THAT FAR OUT HAHAHA :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::HAHA FUNNY YOU SAID IT CAUSE I WAS NEVER INTO THE CINDERELLA STORY.  IT WAS EXPECTED BECAUSE THE STAR PLAYERS WERE OUT BUT LIN HELD HIS OWN IN A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS HIM TO PLAY TO HIS STRENGTH.    WHAT'S FUNNY IS THAT MOST LIN FANS ARE NOT EXPECTING HIM TO BE ELITE BUT BELIEVED THE KID HAS POTENTIALS.  HOWEVER IT'S THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS THAT ARE THE ONES SETTING THE BAR VERY HIGH FOR LIN AND HOPING HE FAILS TO MAKE A POINT HAHAHA!  P.S. OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE THE MOST IRRATIONAL/OBNOXIOUS FANS OUT THERE :)
Laughs2006::lin is not a max player simple. Melo is one of the best players in the world lin is not even the best player on his team. sorry your a little butt hurt that the cinderella story is over but get over it dude is average i love the story but he is a middle of the pack pg.
rEdBuLxTaSy::WITH THE ROCKETS, LIN'S ROLE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A SPOT UP SHOOTER.  HE BRINGS THE BALL UP HALF COURT, THEN DEFERS IT TO HARDEN AND IT NEVER COMES BACK.  LIN THEN GOES TO WAIT BEHIND THE 3 PT ARC AND EVERYBODY WATCHES HARDEN MAKE MAGIC HAHA!  THAT'S NOT EVEN LIN'S GAME.  HE WAS AT HIS BEST WHEN HE PLAYS AGGRESSIVE, PENETRATES TO THE PAINT FOR A LAYOUT OR DISHES IT OUT TO AN OPEN MAN FOR AN EASY BUCKET.  IF YOU'RE NOT GONA UTILIZE A PLAYERS TO HIS STRENGTH, MIGHT AS WELL JUST BENCH HIM.
Bigmayne313::Lin was winning games with less talent on the Knicks while the stars were down, whats he doin now?
Bigmayne313::Couldnt have said it better myself bruh!
NoonGame::lol, everybody gave up on lin already...he only has about 30 starts in the nba...and some of those games he has double/double and near triple double. Sure, his shooting sucks...but it's not impossible to fix...but everything else about his game look pretty good...rebounds/passings/assists/steals...
Laughs2006::the obssesed lin haters are simply doing the same foolishness the obsessed lin lovers were doing last year and to be honest some of you guys deserve it....I love Lin hope he gets better but he is average and his contract is ridiculous he is not a max player period....but im not mad at him for making money just glad the knicks were not stupid enough to lock into a stupid contract like that again.
Bigmayne313::If Lin helped the Rockets win games then he would be talked about, Harden came in and stole the show
rEdBuLxTaSy::JUST PUT IT THIS WAY...OBSESSED LIN HATERS DON'T THINK LOGICALLY AND SELF EMPOWERMENT IS NOT THEIR STRENGHTH.  OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE LIKE LEECHES...THEY ALWAYS THINK THEY'RE ENTITLED TO SOME KIND OF HANDOUTS BECAUSE THE WORD "ENTITLEMENT" IS EMBEDDED INTO THEIR DELUSIONAL MINDS SINCE BIRTH. :):):)
stugotzz82::Felton&gt;Lin
Bigmayne313::^^Let me get this str8, you're still a rookie til you start playing more minutes? LOL! you sound like a Lin lover bruh, he played 22 games with GSW, 30 something games with the Knicks and about 8 games with the Rockets and you still call him a rookie? GTFOH
rEdBuLxTaSy::RIGHT KEEP ON COMPARING A ROOKIE STARTER IN HIS 2ND YEAR, SURROUNDED WITH YOUNG ROOKIES VERSUS A FATTIE WHO HAS 8 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND PLAYING WITH A BUNCH OF AGING VETERANS.  HOW SMART AND RATIONAL LOL?  :):):)  THIS IS THE SAME BS PEOPLE WERE DOING TO YAO WHEN HE STARTED AND HE END UP BEING ONE OF THE BEST CENTER IN THE NBA.  P.S. OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE THE MOST IRRATIONAL/OBNOXIOUS FANS EVER! :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::HE'S TECHNICALLY A ROOKIE BECAUSE HE'S PLAYED MOSTLY GARBAGE MINUTES IN MOST OF HIS CAREER.
Bigmayne313::Why does everyone call Lin a rookie? This is his 3rd season, whether or not he started this is his job, you cant keep callin him a rookie bcuz he sucks and is still making rookie mistakes. Good/great players adapt and make it happen, something Lin is not doing. Also Yao and Shaq were the only 2 centers in the league back then so it wouldnt be hard to be "one of the best" centers in the league
Wombat1247::Any truth in the rumors of Gasol to Jazz and Big AL &amp; Burks to Lakers !
Wombat1247::So is Milsap, Mo Williams, Bell, Foye, Watson, Tinsley &amp; Carroll !  Jazz might pull the trigger on one or two of these guys - will be interesting as some teams will chase some cap space or a missing piece!  Interesting what the Jazz might back in return!
JustinTimeHeHe::Idk but Al Jefferson is an unresticted free agent this summer
JustinTimeHeHe::Atleast Lin made lots of money and is now laughing at all of you for falling for him. But what happened to Lin drives Volvos? Haha he's not as humble as you all like to think. Oh melo gets coach's fired? What about the poor ESPN writer who wrote the harmless "cheink in armor" article? He got fired and can now be found working 9-7's at Kmart. People love an inspiring, sympathetic story even when it's not real. Lin a rags to riches? I think you got it backwords, here, Derrick rose or Dwayne Wade coming up in the projects and now super-stars in the NBA, that's rags to riches...not some kid who went to harvard and now sucks at basketball.
rEdBuLxTaSy::THIS IS A YOUNG TEAM FULL OF ROOKIES IN REBUILDING MODE.  IF YOU EXPECTED THE ROCKETS TO BE ALL-STAR CALIBER, YOU NEED TO GET YOUR HEAD EXAMINE.    P.S. OBSESSED LIN HATERS ARE THE MOST IRRATIONAL/OBNOXIOUS FANS OUT THERE.
Ina_Knick_of_Time::I agree. The whole sympathy role espn play to make it seem this kid was over looked cause he was asian when really he was over looked cause hes an average player. Im not hating on the guy I actually supported him with the Knicks anybody was better at the time then Tony Douglas crippled Baron Davis and Old immobile Bibby. But the media really went nuts. Theres an article in the NY POST that quoted Lin saying he would still be in NY if D'antoni was still here. LIke if anyone is missing Lin or we would be better with him (7-1) compared to 4-7. The media are his only fans.
rockstar on mars::HARDEN + LIN + ASIK = LEAST LETHAL BIG 3 OF ALL TIME
Dawan208::If they can get their stuff together like in the first two games!
MrTyreee01::harden is in texas! nobody told him to take swiggs of apple cider vinegar and honey over the last day for that infection?!?!?! shame on y'all for not looking out for the home team.
grzelak10::Jazz played pretty good this game!.....oh wait nobody's talkin bout the.game....
rabbishin::...

PHXAZwildcat::betting with an online system called Sportsbettingstar for a few months. I have made over $3,000 a month now for three straight months since I started following it. This system was on the very first page of Google when I searched terms like Baseball Betting System or Sports Betting System.
IamMrBob::Is anybody ever stupid enough to believe the garbage your saying?
0127mary::I hope not
run_this_town::rockets should just tank and go after zeller. they need a pf
IamMrBob::lol we have like 5 pf's on the roster
run_this_town::lowry and harden would be deadly, rockets messed up
Ina_Knick_of_Time::Seriously. Well maybe Lin will go on another 8 game run to help win a few meaningless games and get him some new endorsement deals. Thats all Houston can hope for, cause they arent making the playoffs in the next 3 years especially with the west bottom dwelling teams are improving such as the Blazers, T-Wolves and possible the Warriors if they can get there health togther.
IamMrBob::dude you aren't lying
Dr_Ronix::haha Jeremy Lin is the player i believed he was.  Garbage.
JSimp140::Have fun with that Lin contract, Rockets! If you think it's bad now, just wait until you're paying him maximum wages to ride the bench in two years!
akhorahil::Are you new to Basketball? The Rockets will have ZERO problem trading that expiring contract.
Ina_Knick_of_Time::He must be, first this is his 1st year and least expensive year. Noone will be happy to pick this guy up with nearly 20 mill left for 2 years or nearly 15 mill left for his final year. HOWEVER, Houston isnt playing to win they are playing to sell tickets and they feel Lin (Ming) could help them out. They have no intention on winning games rather just sell seats. Look at Memphis the best team in the west right now and you can see a home game for $13, the Pacers were a pretty good team last year was in 3rd place most of the year yet they didnt sell out one game.
0127mary::Expiring? Are u new to bb? This is the 1st yr of that ridiculous contract.
IamMrBob::Ya i haven't been very impressed with him so far
I3UTTON::Houston Comets &gt; Houston Rockets
Ismael0627::Utah has always been dangerous at home. It's common sense. Even Jeremy Lin is smart enough to know that.
woodylamb::It was a back to back game for the rockets. I think Lin did OK. Seemed that he was more aggressive.
IKnowYouReadThis::all the idiots still hating on Lin, keep talking like you have a low Basketball IQ. the Season just started and he's with a new Team.. Trust me...at some point in the Season this "Linsanity" will be back. I caught a few games at the Garden when this due was on fire. what I saw was the real deal. Jeremy Lin is no mu t h a f ukk in' and you Houston $@%!$ haters  should be happy to have him
skw4712::Amen. Gotta go to sleep to and/or get some life. Have a good one.
skw4712::all the idiots still loving Lin, keep talking like you have a low Basketball IQ. He started to play poorly since late last season. Trust me, never will Linsanity be back, unless he gets to the right system again which allows him to shoot 20+ times a game. I caught a few games last season when he totally hit rock bottom. What I saw was a fake deal. Jeremy Lin is mut h a f u kk in' and you New York Lin lovers should be happy not having him.
IKnowYouReadThis::lmao, relax man..I don't mean no disrespect. besides we're the only two idiots on the board at 1:38am lol we're all a bunch of trashtalkers on here anyway. I think all Basketball Fans are...anyway man...all the best bro
skw4712::Obviously you are awake with me, loser. And what I wrote is exactly what you wrote, except I changed wordings a little bit. It's called a parody.  So that shows your maturity, huh?
IKnowYouReadThis::your maturity is disturbing and uhmm everyone has gone to sleep. goodnight grasshopper, the board is all yours to wreak havoc with your stench,and hate.   P.S look all around you and think to yourself..."where did it all go wrong..how could I have turned out so fu kked up...i'm getting older and dumber"
Go Google it::product of d'antoni offense. also he can't go left
RNYC::A few games when he was on fire. Great pal
skw4712::Your maturity is stunning.
IKnowYouReadThis::K i'll like yours too. you happy mu tha fu k k a  lmao
RNYC::Stop liking your own ridiculous comments Lame
IKnowYouReadThis::go pass gas
NYKnicks-Elite::ok peace out  Just thought I came in to explain the story behind the Lin Fans/Lin Haters situation
BXwarriorBX::D'antoni and Lin  was the PROBLEM not Melo. The Knicks are 25-7 under Woodson!!!
D-Rey-D::lol @ forget to use stats...all you lin haters are just pointing out his ppg and shooting %, not one of you people is looking at his rebounding, assists, and steals! i bet you dont even watch him play and just go str8 to the boxscore once the game is over.
skw4712::That's right. You are one of the few unbiased basketball fans who make sense. Lin lovers somehow forget to use stats, or completely disregard them, blaming 'systems' and 'surrounding talents.'
D-Rey-D::a ton of it is coming from harden
skw4712::Lin only succeeded in D'Antoni's scheme, which puts a lot of importance on PGs. And that was pretty inconsistent, too.
BXwarriorBX::Last season the knicks was 28th in turnovers this season the rockets are 28th in turnovers hhmm I wonder why?
GhostlyWalker17::Dannylko you got a big mouth . Call me a $@%!$@% one more time you fuqqing little wimp
dannylko1.3::??? put down the crackpipe son.  It'll help you out.
GhostlyWalker17::Your a loser. Have fun knowing english but never getting laid and knowing nothing about basketball
GhostlyWalker17::LOL you dont know me man. Why dont you facebook me right now and talk nthat sheyt KID. I would smack the sheyt out of you you little wanna be, think your so hard on the computer, you aint sheyt
dannylko1.3::and you don't know how to speak English properly and you have a tiny brain on ya kid.
GhostlyWalker17::Your not funny. You got such a disrespectful mouth on ya kid.
GhostlyWalker17::Go ahead and flag me like I give a $@%!. Stop calling people names you little bicch, your not tough so dont pretend to be
GhostlyWalker17::..
NYKnicks-Elite::Knicks did a great job in flushing out their scrubs in offseason  Lin (maybe not complete scrub but not good fit), Toney Douglas, LANDRY FIELDS (had to capitalize that), Josh Harrellson, Jared Jeffries (he was alright but no offensive game whatsoever)  so Knicks are now scrub-free and it is resulting in a much better team
RNYC::Landry Fields another D'antoni fraud. OMG he was terrible
D-Rey-D::i agree on douglas...he is just terrible
dannylko1.3::yea they look pretty solid.  No room for injuries though or else it's over.  Douglas is ruining it for Houston now lol
dannylko1.3::haha hasn't changed.  They got rid of a guy named Shaun Livingston who was playing quite well in preseason but they got rid of him and kept douglas.  Wtf? haha
NYKnicks-Elite::sorry u have to deal w/ Douglas  havent seen him yet this season but wont be surprised to know that he only shoots 3s and shoots a bad % and.......rarely penetrates to the rim, just stands around the perimeter  anyway, thats what I remembered most about him
IKnowYouReadThis::Ron Artest, Kobe, and Jordan Hill in a car, who's driving?    The LAPD.
skw4712::People (bbears88) is comparing Lin's performance to football and 'lack of talents' argument...AGAIN.  LOL  Only thing that's lacking in talent in Houston Rockets team is Jeremy Lin's shooting.
Ismael0627::It's like the only thing Jeremy Lin struggling......
Dawan208::Ghostly walker you say Lin sucks.  Not last year he averaged 18 ppg.   Now it's 10 ppg and there isn't any coverage on him anymore.
GhostlyWalker17::Hs shooting sucks now. He was drawing alot of fouls last year which he hasnt done this year plus he cant shoot. i DONT WANNA HEAR ABOUT LAST YEAR BECAUSE HE HAD LIKE 6 GAMES WHERE HE SCORED 30= POINTS, thats why his stats were so high.
NYKnicks-Elite::Have anyone seen "Lin Future Wife' or ' Linfluence'  I remember those ppl being Lin Fans, just curious
cfylong::He sho Nuffield gettin mo $@%!$ than yo sad @%!, mouthing off like a foo wit no job.
Dawan208::I think she's the cute girl in his work out video.  Part 2. (you tube it).  I'm out. GN!!!!!
RNYC::Knicks are 25-7 under Woodson. The issue was D'antoni not Melo. Yet all the Lin fans hated Melo
RNYC::He wasn't dogging it. That's propaganda and part of the Melo hate. D'antoni was a moron. Lay the blame at his feet.
Ismael0627::D antoni, Melo and Stat drama overpowers Jeremy Lin's 8 game winning steak breakout.
dannylko1.3::oh c'mon, even you must admit Melo didn't play hard for D'antoni nor did he like Lin in particular (or JR Smith)  Let's be real here.
dannylko1.3::never said D'atoni was a good coach or it's always Melo's fault.  No excuse for a player not playing hard for his coach, sorry you don't agree
IKnowYouReadThis::you seriously need a timeout to go pass some gas
RNYC::See that's what I'm talking about. D'antoni was misusing Carmelo Anthony at every turn. Playing him at PG. having him play at the top of the key. Totally misused the talent. Woodson comes in and see the difference. But it's Melos fault. Coaches are supposed to put players in position to succeed.
dannylko1.3::did I once say anything about the stats you dumb@ss?  don't you remember what he said as soon as Woodson took over?  "He's going to play with energy now?" lol...practically admitted it.
GhostlyWalker17::His stats dont lie man. Melo was playing fine, he was our whole $@%!$@ team you idiot
GhostlyWalker17::Another issue- We lost our whole team in melo trade and needed a few years replacing the guys we lost. We had 3 stars, 2 decent players, and 10 scrubs
