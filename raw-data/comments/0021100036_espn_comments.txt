n8n8n888::Jimmer had a nice game.  Forced Rose to go to the bench with a fifth foul, and scored 14 points on 50% shooting.  Onward and upward for him.

ASIK_AND_DESTROY::if ya scared go but a dog
benjaminwithu::anyone comment on c j watson having 9 assists 0 turnovers, in 16 min of play that is amazing if u ask me
2667Derek::I know there's a lot of Jimmer haters out there...and thats fine. I just wish the majority of them weren't on his team.
rynodesign::Sac has a nice young team. They could be good in a couple years. Coach needs to get them playing some team ball though. Lots of One on One last night.  Bulls had some nice stretches were they looked great. Watching these early games is a trip cause most teams are a little out of sync. Players aren't in the right spots on O and D. But the play hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be. I guess I am just happy that they are playing. Booz had a great game. Still lacking on D but that isn't going to change. Doesn't matter much if can keep up a consistent 18 and 10. The bench was great. Nice to see Brewer get off last night.
Trak421::LOL@ Jimmer. This guy is so outclassed it's pathetic. The guy had to play zero defense in college and it shows. I've never seen a played as overrated.
Marcumm::trak get a life. Drose got scored on by him and even got crossed over by jimmer in the fourth. drose  had plenty to deal with. Jimmer has been doing pretty well as a rookie considering Evans refuses to get him the ball.And his defense did struggle at times but who wouldn't against rose. Your obviously a blind hater!
Trak421::Maybe you guys missed the pays where D-Rose made him look like a JUCO player and decided there was no point in trying to defend him.
rynodesign::I thought he looked pretty good for a little guy. He could turn out to be a decent pro players. I wasn't so sure.
purple_pride_4_life::it's hard for him to do anything when the rest of our team is so dang selfish
Rambomonster9::i hate you Bulls fans.  Always giving all the credit to Rose and acting like Noah and Deng suck.  Deng is a dang good defender.  Deng is the best overall player on the team.  and you always, always talk crap on Boozer and when he plays good you just ignore it.  classy.  you want the second coming of M.J. so bad its pathetic
eddyslick::Deng is the man.  I don't want to ever hear again that he doesn't live up to his contract.  Sure, he's a complementary player by nature,  but that's all he needs to be for this team.    You know Kobe is still butthurt and pickin' leather out of his teeth after eating that last second shot on xmas:)
bungsana0::dont stereotype all bulls fans.  the real ones know that rose is a STUD, but the support of deng (pippen 2.0) who is indispensable, along with booz, noah, rip, taj, asik, ronnie, and yes, even korver  are all great players.  the bulls w/o rose wouldn't be nearly as good or a contender for the finals, but they would still be a solid 4 or 5 seed in the east.  its just that the more vocal "fans" are the usual riff raff bandwagon fans.  if you haven't noticed, its these same fans who whined about trading deng 2 years back (now no one screams "overpaid" like they used to) and complain about very little thing.  theyre also the same fans who want to gut our entire TEAM so we could trade for dwight howard and become the "clippers 2: the team thats always on the highlight reel, but squeaks into the playoffs"
TheJaw521::Funny thing is that 3 posts down there's a Bulls fan giving Boozer credit. It's even more funny that this guy is also a heat fan which is bandwagon city. Then he goes off generalizing all Bulls fans followed with a sarcastic classy remark. Lay off the roids dude...
Rich Sizelove::We give all the credit to Rose because most of us have watched the Bulls longer than the last three games. Rose IS the reason this team was elevated from no playoffs to low seed playoffs to elite status... And btw the ENTIRE basketball world wants the second coming of MJ so I dont know why you think thats just a Chicago problem...
sumbrownkid::Noah is there defensively, not for offense.  Have you seen his shot form?  Deng is a great slasher, but he needs a guard like Rose to create for him unfortunately.  Boozer had turf toe last season, and missed a lot of games on his first season under a new system.  Though I won't pardon him this season for last season.  Hamilton can create for himself, but he first needs to learn how the Bulls operate a little more before he can relieve Rose somewhat.    Chicago is going to meet up with Miami in the ECF, and hopefully the results will be different.  A random team with players like Deng and Noah doesn't go 62-20 and still be called "suck".  Those players are very important cogs to the last season.
smartyjones14::First off Noah does suck, Deng is great but without Rose he's a different player, his offensive game is only good not great, Rose is the only player on the team who can get his own shot and that's why they'll never beat the Heat because Lebron can guard Rose because there's no other legit threat to score. It sucks but its true he's one of the few player who is just as fast  and athletic and has 5 inches on him.  also people hate on Boozer because he plays no defense on a defense oriented team and disapeared in the playoffs
inglehacker::People hated on Lebron for not getting it done alone, and DRose has at least 3 teammates (Deng, Noah, Boozer) better than anyone Lebron had.
surfzone365::Let's go Bulls!  Good game Kings fans. Best of luck to your squad the rest of the way.  Glad to see C.J have a good game and the rest of the team step up.
PlayerPresident1::i would like to thank the refs for keeping this game close.
Tom 7838::I watched that game last night and thought Tim Donaghy was making some of those calls.  I've see my share of NBA games in my life and feel it was one of the worst officiating I ever seen.  There were some calls in the first three periods that were a complete joke.  I enjoy the NBA but at time feel the officials control the outcomes with their poor work.
Johnny B Goode 2001::DA BULLSss
ChippewaDave::15 boards by Boozer. . . now that's more like it.
pistonfanstill::Looks like what will be a typical Box Score for the Bulls as Rip restores his career.  Go Bulls.
sumbrownkid::He still has much to get accustomed to though.  Hopefully he can drop close to 20 points on a regular basis.
pistonfanstill::Dear Derek Rose  When you play the Pistons please help Richard Hamilton score 50+ pts and blow them out so that the owner and stubborn local press can see there is no bright future with Lawrence Frank as head coach.  Thanks
materazzi2323::Can someone please tell me why DRose gets no calls??? If anything he gets called for a bunch of bogus fouls every game
rynodesign::Because the refs are amazed at his speed and body control that they forget to blow the whistle.
etuason78::@m24er - I believe in the promises Lebron made to Miami ================= That's what cleveland fans believed too when he was there lols..   but what makes his statement more believeable in miami is he has Wade there to help him get a ring.
kfoges03::REAL, COMFORTABLE, JEANS!!
Airtight Granny::I've been told by three people here that Lebron "promised" Miami something when clearly he did no such thing... and <b>I'M</b> the one being ignorant??  No.  And I'm not even a Heat fan.  Just pointing out a fact.
Detmar08::You serious Airtight? Not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7. &lt;-----------Sounds like promises
Airtight Granny::you seem to care a whole lot about what I have to say, nerd.
superpieman802::no one cares what you have to say you ignorant tool.  remove your lips from lebrons thang and get over the fact that hes a regular season player who is nothing but a choker
materazzi2323::He didnt promise, but he did say it. Hes a tool either way and the biggest jerk in all of sports, right next to Favre!
Airtight Granny::When did Lebron promise Miami anything?
superpieman802::stop being ignorant you heat bandwagoner.  can we hear from anyone that has been a heat fan for longer then 2 seasons?
Airtight Granny::Ok, now show me the part where he <b>promises</b> something again.  Cause that link has him saying:  <b>"We believe we can win multiple championships if we take care of business and do it the right way."</b>  I don't see any "promises" there.
birdman._.::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT-I8jQDQ7c

Airtight Granny::What did he promise?
Liberal Feminist::On national TV.
super red espresso snowflake::Rose is having an MVP hangover.  He'll have a down year this year.  He'll be back strong next year though.
sumbrownkid::I predict Mitt Romney will become president.  Lol who am I kidding?  Lebron has a better chance at being president than him.
Adam01Said::I predict a super virus will get loose in 2012.
super red espresso snowflake::Well I will have you both know that I own my own house and my IQ is well above 10.  Thank you very little.
superpieman802::wrong
superpieman802::o we are predicting the future.  here is my accurate future prediction  your not going to move out of your moms house anytime soon.
materazzi2323::I predict your IQ is a 10, Rose is gonna have a down year? He already hit a game winner against the Lakers in the 1st game of the season. FAIL!!!
super red espresso snowflake::i..... am..... predicting.... the....... future....... accurately.............
birdman._.::its.... the...... 3rd..... game...... of..... the............ season............
Shoot the J. Shoot it.::Rose has got to control the ball better. he didn't do it much against the heat either last year
sumbrownkid::And this is why Chicago needs another scorer that can attack without being hobbled.
Adam01Said::for 6 plays per game?   Rose had THREE different main defenders against the Heat.   First the pg...with doubles coming from Wade. That was the beginning.  Then Wade takes over main responsibility and the pg doubles.  Then with 3 minutes left in the game LeBron with Wade as the double.  Put LeBron on Rose in the first quarter and see what happens.
btpkk::he had a lot of trouble when Lebum guarded him
johnnyx2011::The way kings are playing, definitely they are moving out of sactown. soon all the fans gonna disappear again.
btpkk::Derrick Rose has Zero steals in 3 games yet he has no problem getting it stolen by the other team
ASaini91::Rose has never been a big stealer. His highest career average for a season was 1 per game
btpkk::wish the Bulls still had Kurt Thomas.He  doesn't get pushed around like Noah does
NBA_refs_are_weak::wow is rip a perfect fit or what? im happy for him he didnt deserve to have his career end like an allen iverson. he's gonna be solid with the bulls and he brings a championship past with him. such a good addition especially for rose. I look forward to my celtics playing in the ECF against them
johnnyx2011::sorry dude, celtics not making it that far this year. East has too many good teams
MEEENMACHINE::Line score doesn't lie . D.Rose -1 +/- 8 assists/ 6 turnovers..CJ Watson in 1/2 the minutes...9 assists / 0 turnovers +9 +/-...LIke Worstbrick the Bulls made their best runs when their chuckers weren't in the game and turning over the ball .
Adam01Said::CJ Watson is a backup. He plays well in that role...but don't get confused as to his talent level.
btpkk::I'm just glad Rose didn't chuck up 3's like he did in the Golden ST game
TheJaw521::Rose shot 7/14. Not exactly chucking like you imply. Some of the the turnovers were bad by Rose but even those seemed like rust more than anything.
kosherkid-ute::Not Jimmer's best game (especially defensively) but he is consistent enough in the #1 skill: scoring. If he works on the other parts of his game he could be an all-around player.
Marcumm::hook has always been a hater.ignore him.
hook58::jimmer will never be as good as you byu homers think he will
Hardcore4Hoops::Jimmer's a gamer. Hes got a really good handle to go with unlimited range.
Ptball0::How is Tyreke just regressing each year? He just stands and pounds the ball into the ground and does nothing, also beyond lazy on Defense. I'm sick of the Kings having "potential". This game was there for the taking, they were down by 1 with 7 mins left in 3rd qtr after playing horrendous. Very disappointed in tonight
Hardcore4Hoops::Officiating usually favors home teams.  Bulls were able to play through all the flopping by Kings big men.
TheJaw521::Bulls played sloppy and had alot of uncharacteristic play. Sactown was getting some weird calls (not that the was the whole reason). DRose with 5 fouls? Tyreke traveled like 3 times with no call.Cousins flopping all over the floor. No way you have +10 offensive rebounds on a normal night against the bulls.
TheJaw521::I wouldn't really mention the reffing normally but at one point Sactown was up +20 FTA on the Bulls before some late intentional fouling. Either way the refs were taking the flow out of the game at alot of points. It was frustrating to watch.
Ptball0::Because their lazy on Defense, selfish on offense, and coached poorly. Tom Thibodeau was up coaching the whole game like it was game 7 of the Finals, and Westphal just sits there with his goofy grin on his face
Hardcore4Hoops::Thibs coaches every game that way.  If anything, Bulls let kings back in game with bad turnovers.  But Bulls made plays when they had to; thats what seperates good teams from bad. Like the talent on the Kings though, just need time to grow as team IMO.
Ptball0::How wasn't it for the taking?? They played horrible basketball and were in a great position to take over
Hardcore4Hoops::Then why didnt they?
Hardcore4Hoops::Game was not "there for the taking" for Kings.  Bulls were obviously the better team tonight.
Hardcore4Hoops::DeMarcus Cousins is a d o u c he  bag.
klesk80::An Easy Win for the Bulls......!   Bulls 97 Clippers 96.5

sumbrownkid::Butler will see minutes later down the line, but for now I think Thibs is more concerned about Hamilton fitting into the system comfortably and confidently.  He is the more expensive investment than Butler is...
