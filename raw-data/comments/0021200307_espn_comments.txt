Tams92::Washington State-77  UL Lafayette-70
CLUTCHBALLERZ::combine these 2 teams and they still wont make the playoffs
2.3.1 Douple Play::Anthony Davis sucks
Javis6484::I think the 107 - 2 high school girls game was probably more exciting...
56tricolor14::Glad the Chris Paul trade worked out.
ball 5o hard::john wall would have more bounce if he played in nikes
951Antonio::The key ingredient to beating New Orleans is trying to stop Austin Rivers from getting a triple double.
YeahTerps420::Hornets haven't won a game since the announcement of the Pelican debacle ... we must give them time to cope.
savannahGA1969::I started using a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. Ive made around 2-3K a month the past couple months using this systems picks. You can find the system on the first page of Google by searching for sports betting systems. If you bet on sports you gotta see this.
pelicansfan526::how about austin rivers huh
stopbanningmeplease10::i remember at the beginning of the season new orleans thought they'd be good, lmao
DuckyDunky::Washington, New Orleans, Cleveland, and Charlotte - will any of these teams make the NBA Finals again before I die?  29, white male. Non smoker, drinks occasionally, 5'11 195 lbs. No major medical problems. Likes to skydive.
schumatrix::How the NBA's currently set up, I'd say no chance for you or me, and I'm a bit younger.
bowielt::I have faith that the hornets are moving in the right direction young and talented team with huge upside i ask that my fellow fans be patient Rome wasn't built over night neither was the top talent it takes time to develop and place the right pieces together i see them moving in the direction of the thunder and spurs far as building this franchise go.

Rip City Forever::The pelicans lmao
Rip City Forever::Jeremy Lin&gt; Austin rivers
bamberg1977::A team with 32.8% FG shooting won. Wow.
Drunkard.::I hate to say this, because he's such a class act, but I think it's time for Monty to go. I'd like to see Mario Elie.
Drunkard.::At least Rivers is starting to play better.
Hank10593::People like Austin RIvers can get drafted as 10th pick and Lin who scored 38 pts on the Spurs couldn't even got drafted in the second round, the NBA scouting system is definitely flawed as f u c k.
bamberg1977::As if Lin is that good. Is that his career game? As Drunkard pointed out, this isn't a fair comparison. But furthermore, scoring alone doesnt make you good. Its all about your efficiency. A lot of guys can come in and scored 20+ ppg for 10 or 20 games or even full seasons, but dont end up career benchers. You need to be able to make the right plays so your team scores efficiently, not just score because you get a lot of shots.
Drunkard.::Rivers is 19, dude, Lin is 24. When Lin was 19 he was a back up at Harvard.
hfelton2001::Hornets scored only 28 points in the second half, seemingly almost impossible for a pro team in the shot clock era.
sweetlew09::wow both teams shot at 32% from the field LOL
The Fresh Prince of Nowhere::The total number of comments says a lot about our fan base/trolling/popularity....pretty much significance lol.   Good game Hornets fans.
lakeshow8424::Good job Wiz.
refreshing29::Didn't see the game, but it looks as though my Wizards team was the least horrific team of the evening.  32% shooting?  Really?
WildBillHiccup122::Austin Rivers would have been undrafted if not for his last name and forcing 15+ shots a night while at Duke.
951Antonio::TRUE DAT!  His game is more like Joan Rivers or Mickey Rivers.
trademarktaz::Damn these teams are horrid
hoofhearted30::Man, where do i get the box set for that game?? That was awesome.
Hank10593::Looking the at the scores, not sure if they are result of great defense or horrific offense. I think the latter makes more sense.
Mattnimp14::The Wiz have a chance to get a lot of wins this month
gt1master_ike::Words can not describe how painful it is being a Hornets fan right now. Oh well, on to the next one.
JrueRandallHoliday::Damn! There goes my VC on 2K...
wareagledude5710::Pelicans lose.
ravenisthebest7::Alright, Beal doing better lately. Not sure why Crawford is shooting like he's Kobe, but oh well. A win is a win.
nkeittpride::Steez.
GeorgeTownDC29::No pg play = low scoring. We havent had any type of pg play with Wall out this year. WIsh we would pick up a solid back up till his return but whatever
bmrsnrox::nba should seriously consider relegation. just sayin
melvin887::Cant wait go see my team play friday vs la
melvin887::Jorden Crawford is the man
melvin887::Wizards baby we best
tarheel11104::Why is Austin Rivers such a crappy free-throw shooter? It's ridiculous...
tarheel11104::Duke is much more fluid without him
lookitsdeco::should have stayed at duke. he thought he was kyrie lmao
tarheel11104::I wish him well, but he's definitely one of the most overrated players I've ever seen
Maniacpkt::he got by on daddy's name
Capt.Voody::Yea! 3rd win of the season! moving on up. Playoff bound!
melvin887::Yes its still early
Maniacpkt::statistically, it's not too late
Hunt0123::Wizards fans seem to be the classiest on these boards
cliffabcd2::bro wall barely has a jump shot and u call him good
Hunt0123::Rondo barely has a jump shot and he is the best point guard in the NBA
lookitsdeco::we aint got no reason to be outrageous
Mattnimp14::Wizards have a chance to go on a little streak let's hope they get it done
lookitsdeco::AY PELICAN FLY FLY PELICAN
NewOrleansPelicans504::don't get excited cuz yall beat our awful team...yall also are terrible...juz sayin...
GeorgeTownDC29::Carwford = Kobe jr.
NewOrleansPelicans504::Can't wait till next year...we clearly need to be the Pelicans instead of Hornets...that will make all the difference.
Wackkk::Well this was a real barn-burner...Neither team could shoot over 33%?  ...Yikes.
Adversaryy::We actually won a game on the road... NBA Finals here we come.
CJ From San Andreas oX Invincible Xo::Hip hip hooray Wizards win!!!
stock-daytrader::This is an embarrassment. Thanks for the 2g's loss Hornets. You can't even beat the Wizards, my god, I expect this performance from the Craptors!
stock-daytrader::You're right I do. Who owns them anyways Lil Wayne lol
lookitsdeco::you need to watch the hornets more..
Maniacpkt::that was a stupid bet  i'd hate to see your stocks
stock-daytrader::If its too easy then it becomes a Clippers Vs Raptors type bet which would have a next to nothing pay out,. with a 3.05 co-efficient it made sense.
Maniacpkt::when two teams are this bad, it's never an "easy win"
stock-daytrader::It should have been an easy win, Hornets at home against the Wizards? I had no spread, it was straight up. And my stocks are quite fine. In fact, if you want to see my stocks, I run some of the biggest penny stock newsletters in the USA, so watch pennystockflips.com on Friday and ill show you.
