earlealston 2.0::Ten years ago people would have thought you were a lunatic if you predicted the Clips would have a 50-win season......
orange-bruins-suns-jaguars-mariners::hollins is a little punk.  big tough guy holding on to a 6'2" point guard in a headlock for 10 seconds.  and then smiling about it afterwards.  even odom and i think crawford came up to him after and were getting in his face.  $@%!$@ scumbag.  kinda wished beasley or o'neal socked him in the face.  not like we have anything to lose.
posse_up::They've sucked for a long long time, but I never knew that they have never won 50 games....
Bumblebee8022000::Looks like a 7 foot bully picking on a midget. Anyways, the Clippers won't last long in the playoffs. Remember how they gave up last year?
papercut1980::Hollins is a dirty piece of sh.t. Matt Barnes is a dirty piece of sh.t. Chris Paul is a flopping dirty piece of sh.t. Odom is a horrible human being and Sterling is one of the most despicable pieces of sh.t to ever walk the earth. What a horrible franchise.
Jmac4539::haters are gonna hate
CAPTAIN-JACK-SPARROW-1::This is why this team is as joke
Shaqs biggest fan::Ryan Hollins is a garbage player. Remember the T'Wolves released him
Dr. Pfaff::What a $@%!$ Hollins is. I can understand if you were the Suns being down 25 like that but c'mon now. Suspend his @%!.
1547anthony::at least the suns didnt back down,the clippers r no where near a championship,all that talent ...two big man that cant shoot, take away there dunks and there goes there game.and the hollins thing ,whatever happens he wont b missed cause he sucks anyways....no game....clipper fans say goodbye to cp3 he's goin to b pissed when they get knocked out of playoffs,cause they ant no match for okc and spurs,u suck la,PUNKS.
i-miss-katt-mobley::its  still  to  early  4  you  to  say  that  remember  everyone  doubted  the miami cheat?mavs? its  playoffs anything  can  happen,injuries,suspensions,ejections,giving  up,or showing  up,thanks  4  the  heads  up  ms.  cleo
BANKROBBA2020::SHAME ON A $@%!$ SHAME ON THE SUNS
papercut1980::Hollins is a dirty piece of sh.t. Barnes is a dirty piece of sh.t. Chris Paul is a dirty piece of sh.t. Lamar Odom is just a despicable human being. Sterling's the biggest piece of sh.t to ever walk the planet. What an awful franchise.
Swish3And1::Clippers should stop being bad .a.ss Lob City, and should start to play real team basketball.   Remember the Win streak earlier in the season? What happened? Playoff time already.
torrtis::Hollins is such a dirty player, such a disgrace to do high fives on the way out.
I am typing this from my work computer::<b>The Clippers will win a championship before the Lakers win another.  Welcome to the Jim Buss era.<b></b></b>
CAPTAIN-JACK-SPARROW-1::Hahahah fail this is a good joke
I am typing this from my work computer::<b>Now I'm waiting for some idiot who lives in the past to post  "16 RINGZ!!!"<b></b></b>
CAPTAIN-JACK-SPARROW-1::Lakers past&gt; clippers has no past
The One and Only Lee Collier::Well if the Clippers lose Chris Paul this offseason, it will be awhile before either LA team wins a championship
TtoMyJ14::just saw what hollins did on sportscenter. He was just being a bully and a dick. Hope hes get suspended for that.
Rok Prijatelj::Sorry Clippers fans but Hollins is $@%!$@%! player who needs to be kicked in his $@%!$@% a.s.s..............moron.......
kennyx4::F'ing idiot! Hollins needs to be suspended.
-Turk-::I don't know which one was worse. Hollins' choke-hold or the fans high-five on the way out. Then the article just topped it. "Arm around his neck " ? Really?
GGGamut::Clipper fans are idiots... why would you cheer this fool Hollins for the BS he instigated?  Your team has a real chance to do something this year and he's worried about a little midget pg that won't even be playing in the playoffs?  I'm afraid the IQ of the Clippers may hold them back and keep them from winning.  If Lamar Odom is the voice of reason on your team, then you gots problems.
Rok Prijatelj::And by the way.......Griffin is underrated.....a lot......he can't score a basket from 1meter.....$@%!$  The only valuable player from Clippers team is Paul and I respect him a lot......:)
Rok Prijatelj::I almost agree GGG............but Dragic is a great playmaker, fast, with a lots of skills etc.......   Unfortunately he doesn't play for much better team.........Hollins should be kicked out of NBA league..........there's much more quality players around the world &amp; USA who could replace such an idiot like Ryan.........
kennyx4::Amen!
epitome1986::damm dragic looked shook!
lakers2013champsz GBE 300 bangbang::run up on me and you diiiiiieeeee http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HJddleEd3U
I Got Jokes::Hollins is a fool.  Focus on your game because you suck, Hollins.  Quit picking on someone half your size.  Clippers &gt; Suns though HA.
i-miss-katt-mobley::i wish elton brand and livingston wouldnt of got injured that group coud of got a ring pg. shaun livingston sam cassel pf. e brand c. kris kaman sg. cuttino mobley sf. correy maggette they  were  awesome
sumodude28::Kobe coughs = 5000+ comments  Clippers set all time mark = 325 comments  moral of story = NO ONE CARES ABOUT CLIPPERS
GMEN.DYNASTY16::#FREEDJCLUE
Your Gay Neighbor Who Likes It In The Ass::I once knew a handsome fella who lived in south LA. His name was Marky. I miss him. He said he wanted better though.
rogerzcard::Was he ur neighbor?
Please be rational::Question... Why are the Clips ahead of Memphis in the playoff standings when the Grizz have a better record?? At first I thought maybe it was because the leader's of each division get the 1,2,3 seed regardless of records, but then I noticed OKC and Denver are in the same division and they are currently 2 and 3 in the standings... Makes no sense
airicad::1st in division is automatic 4th seed... but better record still gets home court so it doesn't matter
trollvtroll6::Haters can hate all they want (and for good reason some of the times), but I'm looking forward to a Clipper banner at Staples!
Dachargers21::I still think the Clippers can match up with OKC and the Spurs! The Clippers have been playing Sloppy ball thanks to VDN who benches Chris Paul and Blake Griffin for about 20 Minutes every game! This guy is not a Good Coach he runs no Offensive Sets for Blake Griffin which makes me SICK! All Vinny does is his stupid Pick and Roll offense he never tries to change it up when teams have Figured how to stop it! I see him gone after the season!
GGGamut::Odds of Clippers raising a banner this year... 1 in a million  Clipper fans: "SO YOU"RE SAYING THERE"S A CHANCE!"
BleedBlueCrew21::They will never hang a banner EVER!
i-miss-katt-mobley::yeah youre right i would love to see the clippers 3peat
Please be rational::They could possibly win 1 series... and then hope for injuries of the other teams' best players for the next 3 series... Then they possibly would have a chance... As of right now, there are 4 or 5 teams better than the Clippers.
trollvtroll6::i think cp3 (and blake) gotta hang at least a couple of larry o'brien banners in order for cp3 to get a statue outside staples
i-miss-katt-mobley::i want  my  clippers  1st  banner  and  a  statue  outside  of  staples of  cp3
airicad::me too!
SMANGANG::a division banner? lmaooooooooooooo
trollvtroll6::Just clinched best season in franchise history, woo hoo!!!!
REDUCE523::Still not convinced if they dont beat the lakers and the Grizz good luck us getting out of the 1st round. This team blows out horrible teams and plays like crap against good teams.
David722249::Lakers don't care enough to win, save Kobe.
mason8181::Daaaamn Clippers getting franchise record 50th win and only got 300 comments? Wow... Lakers get that many comments about 3 days before game starts.
Jmac4539::that just shows you how many bandwagon fans there is.....
airicad::yeah, i'm real jealous that we don't get the number of trolls that the Lakers board gets...
Silverio60::I think I hurt a Lakers fan feelings.
airicad::imo, the memphis game is a must win.  to prove that we are still elite.  we are, the concentration and chemistry just isn't there like at the beginning of the year.
i-miss-katt-mobley::yeah  we  need  to  beat  the  fakers  and memphis
airicad::we better not lose to the fakers
i-miss-katt-mobley::i cant  wait  to  smash  on  the  fakers -ryan  hollins
Deaneer32::This win really showed me....nothing. nothing at all.
airicad::agreed
Deaneer32::I mean we all know the can blow out the bad teams, but we ain't going anywhere If we can't figure out a way to win against the better teams....Its not like we're gonna play the Suns in the playoffs...
airicad::dj now lead the league (qualified players) in FG% :)
David722249::Once upon a time the Lakers were good and respectable franchise.
airicad::yea they were good, but when were they ever respectable?
David722249::Where do you draw the line then. I mean Shawn Kemp fathered something like 10 kids with a variety of different women, but no one mentions it. Or what about Critendon and his murder rap. Magic's indiscretions were mild in comparison.
airicad::not sure if respectable is the right word for magic.  after all, he was the guy who contracted aids from all the groupies he had
David722249::Jerry West &amp; Magic Johnson...
