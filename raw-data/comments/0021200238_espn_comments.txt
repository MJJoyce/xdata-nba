BleedingBoston::Hi
ek148::Doc has a problem with this HEARTLESS bunch of PHONIES
green solution::Doc is the problem.
Kaluroso::Ray Allen &gt; Terry "The Jet".
fearthechicken2012::No worries. C's will have it together when it counts, the playoffs. Doc Rivers and emotional wreck after the death of Rick Majerus. Rivers knew Majerus wasn't going to make it through the night while on the bench.
dvl76::bucks are good this season
3006Todd::Bucks win yet the highlight plays are 90% Celtics. Same $@%!, different day.
_I Am A Celtic_::I like it more when we win
jeff050578::Yay Bucks. Keep proving the haters wrong. With the eastern conference being what it is the Bucks could be anywhere from a 5-8 seed and maybe sneak a 1st round playoff series win.
palsy360::This boston team is crap
ApookTheDestroyer::I wouldn't be took quick to judge them by how they look with Rondo. He is INCREDIBLY important to them. He might be the best facilitating point guard in the league. Keep in mind that I really dislike the little twerp, but credit where credit is due.
jeff050578::They made the ECF's last year and last year their record was worse than it is now 17 games into the season. I wouldnt judge them until playoff time because you probably said the same thing about them last year.
1chicago sportsfan::damnit Celtics, you can't help my team for once can you
J-SMOOVE3333::celdicks suck
d_bokk::sanders made last nights triple double legit, this guy's for real
TresMilagro::Wow! C's looking good. NOT! Lakers and C's, time for the old teams to retire. Super suckville.
palsy360::That was then this is now. The division is more competitive. Boston is finished
nba is the worst::Let's see - Celtics Missing Rondo (and Bradley).  9-8 this year.  What was last year's eventual ECF team after 17 games? 8-9
ApookTheDestroyer::'Missing Rondo' is huge. He is easily worth 3 points a game to them, which would have been enough tonight.
palsy360::They probably was n 1st place with that 8-9 start. Not this time it's a brand new yr
lakers2013champsssz::celtics got most of their titles when there were 4 teams in the nba
TresMilagro::Jealousy and stupidity do not become you.
XCbeza4.0::trolling and liking your own comment is stupid
