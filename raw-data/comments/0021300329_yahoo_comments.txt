Commenter::Big Al misses from 4 feet, Kemba misses a lay up, Pacers go up by 4.  At least the Bobcats were competitive from beginning to end.  We in Charlotte still accept moral victories.
bgood2life::When i look at the Pacers  game details box score,"Dance with Lance",Stephenson that is, continues to elevate his all around game to an all star level. Currently the majority of the media looks at Paul George, as the new up and coming super star and leader of the Indiana Pacers. However,if that is the case,Stephenson is worthy of being his sidekick . Check out his stat's.
U.S. Military::Was at the Pacers game the other night against the Heat. Miami is a dirty team! Go Pacers! Another great win.
Kadak_Chai::I think that the Pacers organization has done one heck of a job putting this squad together. I don't know how Larry Legend saw Paul George's potential 5 years back but I guess that's why he's running the show in Indiana.   Off Topic: I think Larry is to the NBA what Peyton Manning is to the NFL. Pure class, smarts & game.   Go Pacers !!! & Thank you Larry! Your "3-year plan" is kicking some serious butt!!!
R rules::If any of you have been in the Navy you are familiar with a "hot runner" and that is what the Pacer's are.  A hot runner ignites in the torpedo that armed in the tube and does damage to the submarine.  This is very early in the season and most teams are not in playoff form.  19 and 3 looks good on the surface but payoff time they will have shot their wad.
Joe S::Pacers Win Again!! Go Pacers!
Travis J::Haters keep hating, Pacers keep winning!
On the knoll::Charlotte is much improved this year. They will give an opponent fits in the playoffs. Indiana pulled this one out with a strong last 4 minutes.
Lelouch::the pacers did a good job getting scola cuz they finally got a benched player who can do something and just wait until granger start playing..this team is going to be good
ed m::Pacers is the No. 1 team in the East.
