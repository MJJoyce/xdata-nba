Blue::Rockets should trade Omer Asik for Shawn Marion. The numbers work out, Marion is a goof fit next to Howard, and he's out of place playing SF on Dallas. (Plus he's an expiring contract, so even if it doesn't work Houston saves cap space) The Mavs look like they could use a real center, and Asik is a great fit next to Dirk. He's a great rebounder and Dallas have historically be a low FG% team (because they shoot so many 3s) Dallas could start Vince Carter at the 3.
Greg::Your idea is great but those two are injured so you can't cut them.
Anton::76ers back to reality.
Commenter::everybody lost today because the majority of blacks are still against gay marriage - except Jason Collins - but no NBA you decide to be homophobe so now I am an enemy of the NBA

tim n::Don't buy into the Sixers they will stink this season
tim n::Sixers arent good enough to beat Dallas sorry
Justin::Jason Richardson and Kwame Brown!!!!  Banish them, eat their contracts and put in place 2 veterans who ARE healthy and CAN lead/direct/help.  These 2 mentioned, waste of cap and bench-seats.
Moe Munnay::the atlantic division is trying to out tank each other.
