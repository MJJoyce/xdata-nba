pjazzr::Amare needs to start. this will allow his name to be on the All star ballot.  He is an All Star player not a bench player period.
I pwned all::Anthony guides Knicks to third straight win by shooting 7 for 22. I love how ESPN headlines always make the/nstar player take all the credit. This level of false journalism is embarrassing.
pjazzr::Agree
bluemonsta::Melo is so fat, his name appear in every ESPN articles for Knicks.
I pwned all::Anthony guides Knicks to third straight win by shooting 7 for 22. I love how ESPN headlines always make the star player take all the credit. This level of false journalism is embarrassing.
ApookTheDestroyer::Melo had the most points. STAT and Felton were the most efficient scorers and Chandler had 20 rebounds. Whose name do you stick in the headline?   The won. Who cares about ESPN headlines?
NYKWitness::They feel like they have to choose somebody and he had the most points as well as the best +/- (+19).  8 boards and 6 assists helped too.
pjazzr::they need to get rid of the +/-, he plays 40 minutes
mcmcnyc::The Knicks need to be more disciplined. There's no excuse to let mediocre to bad teams have them on the ropes for the entirety of the first half. It's not like NY is incapable of locking teams down. Miami gets that sort of leeway because they're proven champs. But it's time for the Knicks to start putting the fear of god into teams and that will only happen when they fire on all cylinders from the very start of games.   On the bright side, Amare looks perfect in a bench role. You play him 20-25 minutes and he bullies grossly overmatched 2nd units without staying on the floor long enough to reveal his own defensive limitations.
Yaviah407::ok coach
89joshua89::carmelo needs 1 pt to get to 17,000
pjazzr::which means he's going to take at least 30 shots
tungcn2010::he'll need 10 shot attempts to get that 1 pt.
kmoe332::not good at math are you?
89joshua89::hope he gets it tonight.....lol
KSchuricht::Heading to my first Knicks game at the Garden tonight...Let's get it Bockers!
ApookTheDestroyer::I remember my first (Nixon was the president).  Have a great time!
KnickCityBro::hopefully they win it for you
89joshua89::mavs title team... vs current knicks   mavs  chandler  marion  dirk kidd jj barrea jason terry   knicks  Chandler STAT melo  shump kidd JRsmith felton........   Whos better??
yastru::very similar, but id go for knicks
jballantyne553::Gee..i wonder if stat and melo will have chemistry issues..lol
BlazeandWillieGNYK::3 in a row!  Knickstape!!!  http://tinyurl.com/GoingtotheKnicksGame
oh2swapped::LOL at Brandon Jennings.... "they're not a great defensive team".....You shot 5-18....Just stop talking.  Melo may have had a crap shooting night, but thats his M.O. The Knicks are not the team they are now without him. He is rebounding, and passing the ball. He never has had a 6 in the assists column like he has over the course of this season.
L_Dot::Brandon jennings is not an NBA starter... Bucks need to trade him
fokman::I love the Melo haters come out in droves after a Knick win... Melo is shooting 45% for the season and you dumb assssholes bring up his '% in a Knick blowout... LMFAO... Keep on hating haters... .5 out from the first seed.. we could see Woodson coach the All Star game this year after this weekend!! What will you hate on then?
89joshua89::sounds like a end of game stat watcher.. not a NBA fan!
milwaukeemonster2::10 points is not  a blowout
fokman::They were up like 18 with 5 min to go... Thats a blow out, sorry to break it to you
50stm::headline reads - Anthony leads team to win. does not read shoots 7 for 22  =  32% -   played 44 minutes cause Woodson doesn,t have the balls to take him out.
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::Headline also reads.... another "W" for the knicks and a "L" for the Bucks. Stop whining.
no hope for the human race::7/22 shooting for melo, wow he is really improving!  now go for 35% melo! you got this kid!
ApookTheDestroyer::22 shots, 25 points. Not great, but not bad for an off night. Remember his style of play draws fouls that add up to points. He attracts defenders that make assists possible and not just for him. When he cuts to the basket he draws the attention of defenders even when the ball doesn't come his way.    Give the poor s.o.b. a break.
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::Carmelo is number 2 in the league right now right behind Durant in scoring. So he has a low percentage a game here and a game there, who doesn't? Two games ago he had almost 50 points. Stop being a sore loser, the Bucks just suck.
strongisland06::He has his team in the 2nd seed in the East. But please keep bringing shooting # into the argument like it changes the judgement on how good Carmelo is.
JVR- StrongCards::Melo went 7 for 22 BUT he got 25 points instead of 14 that should tell you right away how much he gets fouled.
Super Bowl NFL 11-11-93::Melo will never win a ring.
ToledoMan::you mean shooting 30% is not good?
jasondmce1978::can you really win a championship when half your shots are 3's?
Super Bowl NFL 11-11-93::No.
JVR- StrongCards::Can you win a Super Bowl with a Chip Kelly offense.
KnickerBoxG-MenRagsFan4Life::http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance This is average of attendance for teams per game. Look at the clippers and lakers, then at the top, click 2-3 years ago. If that doesnt tell you everything you need to know abot bandwagon LA fans, i dont know what will..
MATT FRIEDA::This offensive arsenal between Melo doing his thing, Felton and Chandlers pick and roll, Amare and Felton  (Although they have yet to find their pick and roll game together), Amares improving jump shot and impressive post game, not to mention the streaky but scary 3 point shooting of Smith, Melo, Novak, Shumpert, Kidd and Felton GOTDAMN my mouth is watering. so many different ways this team can score, and lets not forget they could always become a defensive jaugernaut once again when Camby and Sheed return OH $@%!!
MATT FRIEDA::oh and lets not forget about Smith and Shumpert instant offense!!! SCARY $@% TEAM
Constantinius III::LOLOL... every time the Bucks lose, I get this grin on my face because I know that when I open up the  box score I'll find the reason they lost us because Brandon Jennings took an enormous number of shots and missed most of them.  It's never that he played really well and they still lost.  Why do people still say, after being confronted with reams of evidence about his suckitude, that this guy is an All Star?
RNYC::Most people don't watch games or check box scores they rely on espn highlights to make arguments
sportsfan1014::Jennings 13 bricks, so was Ellis, enough said..
Cheapskate21::New York: Where everyone hates each other and no one can do more than mere survival.
Hines Ward Zombie::trolls said stat would f-ck everything up...., lol,  and he is, he's killin' it.
RNYC::No D'antoni
nba is the worst::Melo 7-22. Good job, good effort
DanNYC2108::they won, and he compensated in other areas when his shot was off
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::Amare off the bench has been the best move for the knicks. Carmelo goes out for a few minutes and Amare, Shumpert, and a few others come in? Eventually, they will continue to click and their bench will be too much for other teams. Look at Griffin, most of his points are from dunks and layups. Stoudemire actually has a jumper and is great from the free throw line. Still one of the most ignored PF's in the league today.
KnickerBoxG-MenRagsFan4Life::Totally right, they'll get better and better with the teams core finally healthy, and when Rasheed returns were be better as well, wee need another PF. I dont care if we gotta sign Kenyon martin which i would like for the playoffs, we gotta do something. We NEED another PF for playoffs
RNYC::Rasheed is not coming back.
funyuns72::I have been following a bet system called sportsbettingstar. Im making around $3000 a month proifts using this systems advice. If you bet on sports at all you can find the system on google by searching for sports betting systems.
parafal::"Anthony guides Knicks to 3rd straight win"       guides as in shooting 32% with 7 turnovers?
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::You mad Bro?
kidd54j::dont go away mad ,lol
KnickerBoxG-MenRagsFan4Life::He's right though, they always do that..
parafal::what are you talking about?   just liked the espn headline about his leading performance
Thetimpanikid16::everybody knows that New Jersey is the armpit of the US....
thebiglebongski::psh long island is the same $@%!$@% "sports city" as nyc. you clearly are not familiar with the area or are just completely talking out of ur !$@
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::WHy are they the worst cities? Because the media reports untrue news about them?  You hear the media talk about blackouts in Jacksonville. What they fail to mention is that Jacksonville hasn't had a blacked out game in 3 years and that there are many other cities with lower attendance levels which include, Cincinnati, St. Louis, San Diego, Miami, Tampa, Minnesota and many others.
Super Bowl NFL 11-11-93::New Jersey, Long Island, Sacramento, Jacksonville, and especially Cleveland are the worst sports cities.
SmokeyNYY::New Jersey has everything. Horrible ghettos and the richest neighborhoods you will ever see in your life. We also have NYC, Atlantic City, and Philly all in a 3 hour distance.  All in all its a lot better then 90% of the rest of the U.S.
KnickerBoxG-MenRagsFan4Life::Totally agree and never ever understand why ignorant idiots who've NEVER been to Jersey constantly say that crap lol, they have no clue
JoeyBieg::great game
