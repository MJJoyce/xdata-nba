EKast2012::Redick and Jennings shot 1 for 26?
ALLforthelulz::I don't see the Pacers holding onto tyler after next year. he wants and deserves more than 16 minutes a game. there are plenty of teams that could use his rebounding and ability to get to the line and hit them. I know the C's could
boudz::Some fool GM is gonna pay Brandon big money.
Constantinius III::Despite Brandon Jennings horrible numbers, some team is going to be stupid enough to give him a big extension in the off-season.
dorucevic::Pacers only problem is they don't have a superstar on the team and person that can shoot the three like Miami has 5 of them good ones plus their center can knock it down.
NEONMANIAC77::Hansbrough, another white (American) player forced to sit his developing years on the bench before being allowed to show his talent.
d_bokk::I think the talented NBA players could benefit from a year or two on the bench to start their career. Not that I have much to back it up, but  they get a chance to observe the pros and break bad habits that worked in college but wont in the NBA.  Blake Griffin, Larry Sanders, Hansbrough; maybe some time developing off the court while they adjust to the NBA being very different game from college factors into how they came out running when they finally given a bigger role. I know Griffin had been pegged as being top player, but  it sure didn't look like it was his first time playing in the NBA when his injuries finally healed.
NGplayinskillz::You can blame that on Jim Obrien
d_bokk::classic brandon jennings  for the people who didn't know, Jennings thinks he's a max contract talent
shogunnix::But he scored 55 points once...
tubbyrecuitsthugs::damn right another double double for hansbrough
tubbyrecuitsthugs::he a beast
Windy City Stand Up::lol I hated Hansborough so much in college but now he's beginning to grow on me
Windy City Stand Up::When the Pacers started off playing poorly I constantly was trying to tell my friends that they were an elite team and just wait and see. Now they are and I'm eating it up lol
marklenz24::Jennings is a superstar. Oh HO HO! What a good joke.
Clarence2126::f*u*c*k the does
Clarence2126::does will either barely miss the playoffs or barely make them and get killed by the heat
Clarence2126::miami heat win 25 in a row and the lowly does cant even win one
colobr731::Are you $@%!$@ kidding me? God the Bucks are terrible.
Clarence2126::they suck a*s*s
minifarmgirl12::where's dude that was talking about how the bucks are better w/o ersan and moute?  haha, kid ersan is a stud, can't wait till he's back
Bucks_fan_for_real.....::Jennings 1/15 Redick 1/11  Ewwww
colobr731::Pretty sure I can shoot a better % blind folded.
Bucks_fan_for_real.....::Only bright side is at least Hawks and Celtics lost too.
Ross983::thats a good silver lining, but we will never catch them if we both exchange losses
Mcfly_2015::celts gm is in the 3rd Q
Mcfly_2015::hansbrough!!!
iownamicrowave::Mike Dunleavy, Mic Dunweavy, My Dunwheeli, Milford Brimley
foxx7777::Hansbrough is in the last year of his contract. He is going to find a team where he will be a starter. Think Heat, Spurs, Lakers, wouldn't love to get a player like Hansbrough???
RabbiLevine::Look I would love to see him stay but the Pacers need to be reasonable about the money offered and he will likely get a little more from someone else that we won't be able to afford. Maybe we get a discount, but if not good for Tyler. Always played hard for us, but thats why we have Pendergraph and Plumlee.
The Random Dude35::#HibbertForDPOY  Agree?
RabbiLevine::Say what you want about Roy's scoring drop off this year, I'll still argue he's earning his contract. Can't put a price on what he gives us defensively...
RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser::I agree!
MasterOfLogic::I'll be happy with Hibbert or George.
KN_WisconsinFan::I think I'm a Heat fan now
Hmrstrm::Why......are you getting the urge to eat $@%!$?
RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser::I'm a bear
Rexanilatorz::Anybody hear about that New Mexico beat writer that quit after 33 years writing for them because they lost to Harvard?
BayAreaFan40::bucks could proly lose 10 in a row and still make the playoffs
colobr731::Its not probably, they can. Probably even more.
Bosh has a crush on LeBron thats why he joined the Heat::Brandon Jekyll
hoops 112hoping::http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2364351/georgedunk.gif
RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser::I enjoy the games where Ben Hansbrough gets in.
thexdiamond::Since Hansbrough is only good as a starter, should West be moved to the bench to get the best out of both of them?
Rexanilatorz::sorry but that would be one of the dumbest moves in NBA history
butlerbulldogs87::By no means the dumbest move in history (I think drafting plumlee beats that)...but I don't think it would be smart.
thexdiamond::I'm pretty sure it wouldn't come anywhere near that level of magnitude.
MasterOfLogic::In four starts this season, Hansbrough's stats are:  18.3 ppg, 11.8 rpg, .491 FG%
razzledazzletj81::I don't see him sticking around to be 2nd string when his contract is up.
RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser::He's been on fire the last three. Like to see him keep this up.
masterjoe712::Hanbrough knows its tournament time
Frank Vogel Is My Hero::Best college ball player of ALL TIME!!
bdsmrk::I say let Jennings walk at year's end.  I also think the Bucks are doing everything in their power to meet Miami in the 1st round.  The Bulls are trying to pull a Bears and lose a ton of late season games and we can't capitalize on it... Just sad.
Clarence2126::the does are always sad. they have had some ugly losses to some of the worst teams in the nba
Robdee999::Well, I will catch you jazzy cats later, I have hw I need to turn in before 12...
hoops 112hoping::omg harkless tonight has 25/9 and 4 steals with 4 blocks, matched up against Durant. This kid could be a future PG, reminds me of him in his rookie year. He's rawer but hey i'm quite impressed!!!
razzledazzletj81::Sixers gave him and Vukovich up for nothing, I mean, Bynum.
EastCoastSurfing::#1 DEFENSE HAS RETURNED
RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser::Thank goodness we've been playing like we need to right now.
Clarence2126::ur playing the does, u beat them so what?
RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser::I kept getting banned for talking dirty to Pizza Hut
Robdee999::RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser - I don't mind him. I just like talking dirty  Ehhh hmmm yea :) lol...well c yous l8ta
RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser::I don't mind him. I just like talking dirty
TheHansomestHoosier::Way to take one  for the team
Robdee999::lol ooooo. Pizza Hut is stupid. I wouldn't pay him any mind...
RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser::Think Pizza Hut's stuffed crust. using "stuff" as a verb
Robdee999::WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ??????
MasterOfLogic::2013 season:  Paul George: 18 ppg, 8 rpg, 4 apg Derrick Rose: 0 ppg, 0 rpg, 0 apg  The choice is obvious right? ;)
TheHansomestHoosier::I'm liking this new Psycho T I'm seeing.
RoyHibbertBeautifulestKisser::Think it will mean anything come time to give West a contract?
Granny_Danger33::Hes showing some of that tenacity n the paint now like he did at UNC.
Mo_Vinson700475::Can you draft the best nba team under the cap:  http://tinyurl.com/nba-free-challenge2
chris johnson 558::does redick looking good now ?
buckspackers23::I don't know, but your grammar surely doesn't.
hoops 112hoping::gg bucks nice effort until the mid 3rd or so. Bad luck that Jennings had a brutal game.
Rexanilatorz::yay now we get to discuss Paul George vs. D-Roze
leo9212::is everyone ready for the Bulls fans lol
Robdee999::I need to get my keyboard redone so I can be ready to pound my face on it trying to explain to them that we are the better team....
MasterOfLogic::Yeah, but their team is a complete mess now.... so we'll be putting up with them attacking the Pacers all day long.
Robdee999::That was a nice win, not solid as they could of been but it has been a great one....under 80
Robdee999::Good Game Buck fans....
MasterOfLogic::gg
buckspackers23::Good game.
leo9212::hansbrough looks like he wants to fight lol
Rexanilatorz::Miles Plumlee block party
MasterOfLogic::Woohoo, held them under 80!
mikeyjm1412::That logic sounds legit...
buckspackers23::LOL Quis NEVER passes on fastbreaks.
leo9212::man got to score lol
