Slobodan::on one hand it is obvious that this ut team is worth nothing and that is not the coach's responsibility; he's not hiring and firing players.  but on the other hand the team is completely listless and coldblooded and that is where the coaching comes in.  the bottom line - corbin out soon although he's to blame in part only.
E::Utah's best chance for its first win in the foreseeable future.
Bob::There are 9 games tonight, and this is the one NBATV choses to broadcast nationally?  Are they going after Comedy Central's demographics or what?
Rico M::Denver has 72 games to turn things around.. Will they make the playoffs this year?
Kyle::Probably the two worst teams right now. Something's gotta give.
Cyril::This is a battle between one team who should never have fired their coach and one team who should have fired their coach a long time ago.
Big Sis::When will Corbin stop playing Richard Jefferson?
PKM::Ty lawson should have a field day.
Bultman::Burke - Hayward - Milsap - Favors - Kanter with Hornacek coaching.  Wudda shudda cudda.
Matt::Corbin, honestly.  Make some adjustments!  It's one thing if you've got a proven system, and you just got unlucky and had some close, hard-fought losses, but the margin of loss for the Jazz has been 20+ for most of these games!  Time for Corbin to go.
