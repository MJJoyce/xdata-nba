Hawksaholic::Heat TV announcers: YOU'RE TERRIBLE!
creed brother::After repeatedly reading comments about how the Heat are "cHeats" and how almost all of their fans are just on the bandwagon, I'm starting to wonder if there's also a Heat Hater bandwagon.
Joe Martinez::Heat Will Destroy any team in the Playoffs even though they beat Miami in regular season. and the word "IF" wich is often used by Heat Haters for their team will not win any championship, so suck it up heat haters.....Hahahahahahahahahaha
Apples::Beasley is going to be really scary when he learns effective defense.
I State Facts And You Get Mad::18 shots to get 30, KD needed 32 shots to get 48... So if LBJ took 14 more shots, he just would have needed to score 18 points to match KD's total which he would have easily done... If LBJ took 32 shots, he would have scored around 55 points...
JaValeMcGee::It looks like Rudy Gay trade was a win-win for both team.  Now east got 4 team above 50%.
I State Facts And You Get Mad::I thought people called the Heat the cHeat becuz they thought they get ref help but they call them that becuz they have a superstar team, lolol talk about butt hurt people...  Lakers have superstar teams all the time and no one cares, Boston has had them and even the Bulls..
Jfer::Here we go again....the MOST DESPISED champs!
Commenter::i agree the tv announcers are terrible. 90% of the time they talk of the other team or spew who-cares stats. the worst!!!
Ify::Will somebody slap Bosh beside his head to wake him up? He is day-dreaming. Miami 11/9 assist: turnover ratio. Resons why they are struggling
