fernando::i love the clips but unfortunately they will not go far without rebounding interior defense help...sure jordan is playing like a monster, as is blake , but look what happens to them against marc gasol led grizzlies or a team of that nature (indiana) with big talent up front!
KEITH::Jennings is what he was with the Bucks, why is anybody surprised.
Cyril::I've been told I shouldn't be "ragging" on Brandon Jennings so much because it's not his fault that he plays this badly.  Whatever you say, Jennings fans...at this point he's playing so poorly that I don't really even have to say anything.
Robert S::Deandre Jordan right now is 7-7 FG and 0-6 FT.  That's priceless.  Also, Blake Griffin has seriously upped his game this year.  Doesn't show it in the stat sheet, but the guy has played fantastic.
tirthapada::Why doesn't Det put Stuckey back in regularly instead of Pope? Jennings and Stuckey would be a lot better…I don't understand the reasoning behind playing Pope so much? They are losing too many games because of their backcourt combinations…Cheeks has got to wake up to that fact!
Hollywood::Remember the Clippers going past the second round of the playoffs? Oh sorry.
Anton::On paper the Pistons are really good...
Oink Oink Dooley::Yippee a regular season win.
No Name::I see Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is scoring his usual 4 points a game. Vincent Goodwill, the star gazing cheerleading beat writer from the Detroit News will say KCP played Dennis Johnson lockdown defense on Crawford and Reddick. Goodwill is one ofessional so-called journalist I have ever seen. This kid should be covering high school sports with the fluff #$%$ he writes about his buddies on the Pistons. That includes Drew Sharp(less) and Vince Ellis-both of the Free Press.
Hair Club Dooley::I miss the Lottery days.
