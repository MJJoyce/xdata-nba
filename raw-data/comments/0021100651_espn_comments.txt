Jason65685::As a Celts fan, we need to keep Pierce and Rondo, and look towards young/semi young talent, take a hit for a season or two then make a serious run before we become irrelevant....
kojo1978::C's should trade the big 3 to some contenders for some draft picks. Those guys can still contribute off the bench for someone but these younger teams are killing us and I cant take it. They need to start playing Johnson and Moore a little bit to see where those guys are at.
Luclongley_MVP::Remain calm, the Celtics are a joke.  Nothing to see here folks.
Homesquid::Kings POUNDED the Celtics without their best player on the floor the whole game.   Boston's bench isn't going to intimidate ANY team in the NBA.   Even if they squeek into the playoffs, they are going out 0-4, FIRST ROUND.
ACandOJ::Why don't the C's just stop doing this to themselves &amp; their fans....just forfeit the rest of the season.  They are damn awful...
Tim Masek::monte ellis got traded to bucks there pretty good now
bengafan111::Good game tonight C's have a chance against the Nuggets
NYSports.::21-17
Alejandra7788::Damn! Blowout!!
jaurijauri::great, no trades, so we just will have a bumping season like this till exiting on 1st round playoffs 4-0 or 4-1. And because of that, not good draft pick. Great Danny Ainge!!
rolando77::Got so scrappy on here tonight. It's all good C's. We hate the Lakers and so do you. Common ground. Boom.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Well, GG and GL C's. Great job kings, hope we keep it up Sunday. GN all, GO KINGS!
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::everybody leave?
Peyton to the Niners::ok, i gotta go outside and masturbate, cya, happy wait for me in my bedroom and bring the lube
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::gn freak
Duke will win it all this year oh wait damn::KONY 2012!!!!
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::your name rocks
Barrk1::Too late for me, I got to go to my 5th grade class tomorrow. CYA! (Saturday Detention is the worst!)
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::gn sicko
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::barrk are you getting pounded from behind right now, because you seem to love it
Barrk1::Yes, we are both part of the human centipede
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::dogface hitler had a pretty good game huh?
Barrk1::Does that mean he gets to pound you from behind?

HappyHappyJoyJoy01::Barrk can you please say somebody else gets pounded from behind, it's getting annoying
Barrk1::Only if you say the "Kings suck and Tyreke Evans is pounding me from behind this very moment"
Barrk1::Why not? It's true.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::no
Peyton to the Niners::Ya fa.ggot, like i've been saying, I'm gonna pound you from behind
SallieManda::Yeah TJ567, there was this game that set the SEC record http://bit.ly/zcantq
DaBostonStrangler10::I'd let Megan Fox pound me from behind
DaBostonStrangler10::I'd let her pound me from behind and take a dump on my chest at the same time
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::agreed
Barrk1::You are getting pounded from behind so hard it makes you sick?
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::you sick gay freaks
Peyton to the Niners::shut up fa.ggot, lemme pound you from behind
Barrk1::"Only if she uses a strap on" -HappyHappyJoyJoy01
Peyton to the Niners::I'd let her take a dump on my chest
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::I bet my house that barrk will comment on me getting pounded from behind on this comment.
Peyton to the Niners::I'm going to pound you from behind
Barrk1::and me
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::SOAB
liver_pill::count me in too
Barrk1::You don't own a house, your parents do
BostonFan0702::HA!
DaBostonStrangler10::Like this comment
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::seriously why do so many people keep liking barrks comments?
liver_pill::I just wish he's add something to his repetoire other than pounding people from behind.  Otherwise, I dont' mind him too much.
DaBostonStrangler10::He's actually pretty funny
liver_pill::Cant believe I actually laughed at that.  It must be getting late.
Peyton to the Niners::shut up fa.ggot
Barrk1::Its funny because you really are getting pounded from behind as we speak
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::he says the same thing every time
BostonFan0702::Cause you're a clown lol thought you knew that by now
Barrk1::Whoever likes my comment the most gets to pound you from behind
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::IT:13pts,10dimes,3rebs,2stls,2TO's,5-11 shooting Rondo:4pts,12dimes,3rebs,1stl,4TO's,2-9 shooting We know who won that battle
Barrk1::So the winner gets to pound you from behind?
cpoppanom::Celtics suck.  They played just well enough (against bad teams, mind you) over the last couple of weeks to keep the nearsighted GM from trading them.  Now they can coast to complete and utter mediocrity.  Good news for C's fans is that the team will have lots of money to spend in the offseason.  Nevermind the fact that no player good enough to have his pick of teams would pick Boston (has never happened in C's history).  As a C's fan, I'd like to extend a personal "Thank you" to Danny Ainge.  I was beginning to miss the way things were from 1990-2007.
cpoppanom::I'd sacrifice 1 title for 20 seasons of legitimate contention
Peyton to the Niners::Do you know how many teams would sacrifice ~5+ seasons for one title? Many. The shltty Kings are one of them.
liver_pill::I'm surprised Ainge didn't pick up Derek Fisher yesterday.
DaBostonStrangler10::Without Danny Ainge, we'd be the same team from 1990 to this day. You're the definition of a spoiled Boston fan who grew up in the golden era.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::the replay is on yeah
Barrk1::Replay of you being pounded from behind?
Barrk1::So the whole C's team is pounding you from behind?
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::if you replace you with the C's, then yes
Barrk1::http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg149/barrkphoto/Screenshot2012-03-12at11727PM.png
DaBostonStrangler10::Congratulations, nobody cares at all.
BurienCityBasketballPhenomenon::Seriously, Barrk1, I'm on the phone with ESPN right now. They are going to delete your account
Barrk1::Sony told me that if I ever made an account on their SOE forums again, they would have legal action pursued against me
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::you are gonna be on hold FOREVER
Barrk1::Like you will be pounded from behind forever
liver_pill::celtsfan91477 is an idiot.  How can C fans tolerate that guy?
liver_pill::Does he watch the games or just the refs?  I actually kind of pity the guy.
liver_pill::ya
DaBostonStrangler10::He watches more of the refs. But the funny thing is that he NEVER replies to anything anybody says about him. Once and a while he'll comment on a post, but he never talks to anybody directly. Very strange dude.
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::C's got fouled, not called again BSBSBSBS REFS SUCK WAHHH -celtsfan
Barrk1::He is a lakers fan, guy
DaBostonStrangler10::I always make fun of him. At the beginning of the year I thought he was a troll, but he's been here for every game so he's gotta be a real fan. Sadly....
Barrk1::Like you let Niners fan blindly pound you from behind?
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::feel bad for him, he is blind and just goes by whilstles
BurienCityBasketballPhenomenon::___    ^    - Barrk1's d.i.c.k
Barrk1::It's funny because that is more impressive than the Kings franchise
Barrk1::You are a homophobe, guy
HappyHappyJoyJoy01::gay freak

BostonFan0702::I mean really, who really wants to play in that shittie @$@% city.  Even our future looks bright, with KG and Ray coming off the books next year, we'll going to be able to sign a couple big FA's other than the Kings, who nobody wants to play for, other than the guys who get drafted there lol. I'm pretty sure they don't want to be there....
BostonFan0702::Yeah, things are really looking up for the Kings....NOT!!!
