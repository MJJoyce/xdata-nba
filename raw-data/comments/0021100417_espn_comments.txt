JAHQUAN3::Most disappointing loss of the year for the Jazz IMO
GsU -3000-GsU::disappointed in Paul's play last night.. he seemed frustrated. Favors came in and played well.
Frank38443::Oh man.. handed the Hornets just their 5th win in 28 games played. Still consider yourselves playoff bound Jazz fans?
goalie1113::its a shortened season. heck, the heat have lost to the bucks twice this year. teams are going to take nights off, especially when theres back to back to back games....
JAHQUAN3::I still think they can make the playoffs but they are only a borderline team even if we won last night. This team so far is way ahead of schedule
Wombat1247::No - did not expect to make playoffs this year or next to be honest , but will be very dangerous after that
prezh601::Kahman is very underated ... unleash the beast.. he played for a slum team who underutilized him and simply wanted him to rebound..If they get this team healthy and a starting rotation with him and okafur healthy.. things could be looking up.. but they have to find a way to get Eric Gordon healthy and in the lineup...  starting 5 rotation Chris Kahman.. Okafur..trevor ariza(aminu.or summers) whoever is the most consistant..SG-Eric gordon.. PG Jarret Jack  or  C-KAhman .... PF.. landry..SF.. ariza.. SG (belinelli or Vasquez) pg Eric Gordon..
GoonSquadd::If Kaman had played like this all year we wouldn't be in this mess.
noazrk::I think it's funny they are trying to trade Kaman but are "rebuilding" with Emeka Okafor who has never lived up to his draft status yet Kaman has always exceeded expectations.
THE JEFFERNATER::Utah fans actually claiming Millsap is better than Dirk.. Yeah right..
CandySparker::Hola Lotta Love!
Caan2184::IS THEIR ANY BLACK PEOPLE IN UTAH??????
didyougetthememookur::We're like the 9th or 10th whitest state.  Vermont is first I think, so at least we're not as bad as Vermont.
Robert Harsh::yes lots of em
123cityboy::Wow how embarrassing!! Freakin Jazz!!
Phatjam98::LOL they are like 21 years old... they need a PG then they just need to mature.  OKC did exactly what the Jazz are trying to do.  OKC was not good Durants first year... second year and started to get better in the 3rd or 4th year.  Seriously get a grip
Utah_Dirtbiker::Yep, I knew this would happen. I think some guys were looking ahead to OKC. Horrible game by the Jazz, they are a .500 team at best and Kevin O'Connor needs to make some moves.
Robert Harsh::who thinks the Lakers will beat the jazz
Caan2184::EVERYBODY, NOW SHUT UP
Robert Harsh::you shut up caan
super_lintendo_101::eATING BABY FOOD&gt;JAZZ
Caan2184::KANTER REMINDS ME OF GREG ODEN????       NO GAME, JUS HYPE
Phatjam98::You are an idiot, Oden is really good... when he isn't hurt.  Kanter is not hurt, has not played ball in over a year as he was banned from playing in NCAA and is still getting into game shape... Oh and he is 19.  You are a terrible judge of basketball talent huh?
Utah_Dirtbiker::Kanter is only 19 freaking years old. Give the kid a break for now.
Caan2184::SO CLEVER BUDDY, I THINK UR THAT NERD EVERYBODY STOLE HIS LUNCH AT SCHOOL.....HA HA

Caan2184::YOU ARE WATCHING OLD COLLEGE HIGHLIGHTS OF GREG ODEN..........BUDDY
Beardedblazerfan::Instead of the games he has played this year?
seanie719::Huh? Greg Oden has game. Hes just injured 24/7. When he plays hes good.
Robert Harsh::HEY ALL YOU JAZZ FANS, YOU BETTER GET YOUR TOWELS TO WIPE YOUR EYES WHEN THE LAKERS WIN IN L.A.
Wombat1247::Agreed - Jazz will most likley lose by 20 tomorrow night
Utah_Dirtbiker::We have to wait for the Jazz to lose to OKC by 20 tomorrow first. I am a big Jazz fan, but I am not stupid, the Jazz will lose to OKC in their 3rd game in 3 nights. OKC han't even played since they beat the Jazz on Friday.
allowishes8::dog poop &gt; jazz

Robert Harsh::LAKERS 107  JAZZ  73  GO LAKERS
Wombat1247::Thunder tomorrow night thats it, but didn't the Jazz beat the Lakers last game!
Utah_Dirtbiker::The Jazz play OKC tomorrow. They're not even thinking about LA right now in the middle of their back to back to back.
Robert Harsh::Heat  95  Lakers  101  in the NBA  finals. GO LAKERS.
Wombat1247::wont happen, Lakers lucky to get out of the first round this season
crviehweg::lol keep dreaming

Robert Harsh::I KNOW
Caan2184::BUDDY, JAZZ SUCK.......D.HARRIS WORST PG IN THE NBA
Robert Harsh::BUT THE LAKERS BEAT THE JAZZ 2 TIMES
Caan2184::MY FRIEND, THE LAKERS HAD TROUBLE BEATING RAPTORS, WITHOUT BARGNANI AND BAYLESS
jct279::Xavier Henry has been bad since college. He is absolutely a waste of a roster spot.
Doggrell13::yup. that's why we got rid of him (memphis).
Robert Harsh::the can go to the finals, but they wont, its possible, but they wont.
21 ShumpStreet::KEEP HATING ON THE KNICKS, YOU WONT BE ABLE TO MOCK THEIR LOSING RECORD MUCH LONGER, BY  THE END OF THE WEEK THEY WILL BE ABOVE 500, AND ON THEIR WAY TO THE TOP, JAZZ SUCK.

cubbiesrule1672::Chris kaman=beast...when r the hornets ever Gonna trade him for some good young talent...kaman needs a ring and he ain't gonna win one on the hornets
Robert Harsh::THERE IS NO WAY THE JAZZ CAN GO TO THE NBA FINALS.
Caan2184::MAYBE IN THE VIDEO GAME

KeMvP277::Too bad the Knicks and Mets are a joke.
KeMvP277::I don't live in wisconson
21 ShumpStreet::AND BY THE WAY, EVERY TEAM IN SPORTS "BUYS" THEIR PLAYERS. THERE IS NO SALARY CAP IN BASEBALL, SO WHY SHOULDN'T THEY SPEND MONEY? OH AND SORRY THAT BIG NAMES WANT TO PLAY IN NY, AND NOT IN YOUR TERRIBLE STATE.
21 ShumpStreet::OH GOD, YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE HUH? KNICKS ARE 5-0 WITH A PG AND WILL WIN THEIR NEXT 3 GAMES FOR SURE, THEN OUR FIRST REAL TEST VS THE MAVS. HOW CAN A TEAM WITH LIN MELO STAT AND CHANDLER NOT BE GOOD, YOU ARE AN IDIOT.
Robert Harsh::YOU HAVE NO CLASS YANKEE FAN
KeMvP277::Knicks are good? LOL!! That's like calling the Wizards good. And have the Yankees won a legit championship w/o buying anybody yet?
21 ShumpStreet::TOO BAD THE KNICKS ARE GOING TO BE GOOD THIS YEAR, AND IM A YANKEES FAN, SORRY.
yannistoes::What's wrong with wisconsin?
yannistoes::guess nothing's wrong then...
21 ShumpStreet::NOTHING IF YOU LIKE BEING POOR AND LIVING AROUND A BUNCH OF HICKS
packfan21mt::nothing.
yodaspeaks::Devin Harris had 6 double digit assist games for the Nets last January.  He has yet to have 6 double digit assist games for his duration with the Jazz.  Holy cow.
yannistoes::Holy Cow
yannistoes::And when was the last time the Net's were a contender for anything?
yannistoes::didn't say they were... from what you said, i figured we were talking in past tense... and yeah, i'd say they were contenders in the past
yodaspeaks::The Jazz are contenders now?
Spursdc::incredible
packfan21mt::Lin missed 16 shots against the T=Wolves.
yodaspeaks::He did that for the jazz, he would get planted behind Earl Watson on the bench.
21 ShumpStreet::ONE BAD HALF. GUESS WHO MADE THE GAME WINNING FT?
21 ShumpStreet::WHO MADE THE GAME WINNING FT WAS THE QUESTION
KeMvP277::He missed 1/2.
Mattisbettertwin::As a hornets fan it feels so good to finally get a much needed win, and it came against a playoff team without four of our best players (Gordon, Jack, Okafor, Landry), plus another quality backup in Jason Smith. Geaux Hornets!
njhaines::Okafor sucks, if he's in and Kaman's out, Hornets lose by 10.
yannistoes::well said. You're the man Mattis
21 ShumpStreet::PACK FAN SAYS LIN ISNT A TEAM PLAYER. I GUESS 8 APG IN HIS FIRST  4 STARTS ISNT TEAM ORIENTED ENOUGH FOR THE DUMB WISCONSINER.
KeMvP277::He was the only person that would shoot in those games. 8-24 against Minni. He'll be taking 10 shots when Melo and Stat are back. Get over it Iman Shumpert.
Caan2184::ITS ALL OVER UTAH, NO GOOD TEAM LOSES TO HORNETS...........WOWEEEE
jpark1414::hornets are the best team in the nba i thought?
yannistoes::T_BAG!

21 ShumpStreet::JEREMY LIN SCORED MORE POINTS THAN ANY PLAYER IN THEIR FIRST 4 CAREER STARTS, AND YOU COMPARE THAT LITTLE BEAN WATSON TO HIM? LMAO
jpark1414::your a freaking dumb $@% lin isnt a team player? he only talks about his team. go lick your boy friends booty hole. you lost to the $@%!$@% hornets you cant talk $@%! $@%!$ punk
yannistoes::it's all the ham fried rice
Caan2184::UR DUMB BUDDY, GO 2 SLEEP
packfan21mt::well watson is a team player. Lin isnt.
adamvogltanz::Damn, stop biatching and go watch the Clippers Mavs game, its pretty good and both teams are much better than the Knicks or the Jazz
packers8652::typical new york queers win two superbowls and think they are good
jpark1414::you should really not be so bitter its not their fault they can salsa better then any team out there!
packfan21mt::earl watson &gt; Jeremy Lin

Robert Harsh::I AM IN UTAH BUT I AM A LAKERS FAN
KeMvP277::WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING
packers8652::lol thats why the knicks only started winning after melo and stat got hurt hahaha
21 ShumpStreet::ACTUALLY IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT LIN CAME ALONG YOU DOPE
KeMvP277::Na i don't really care about the Knicks. But it will happen.
21 ShumpStreet::YOU WISH
KeMvP277::Yeah and he'll craw back into a whole after those two players come back.
yodaspeaks::I want to hear from Jazz fans...what's wrong with the Jazz right now?
JAHQUAN3::At this point in the season the Jazz are way ahead of schedule so in the context of your question nothing is wrong with them. Just looking at their flaws I can name several. Defense and offense from the PG positions. We are horrible defending the pick and roll. Also this has to be the worst shooting Jazz team I've seen in my lifetime. Howard has not played good at all and defensively the Jazz lack consistency. Couple that with turning the ball over a ton as of late. We are starting to see that the Jazz have a way to go still to be consistent night in and night out
nallad47::Raja Bell is not the problem.. The problem is Howard is getting minutes and not producing. Miles is getting minutes and not producing.. Miles has his good games and then horrible games.. He needs to keep taking it to the rack. Harris needs to be traded away to a team that runs his style of play. The Jazz do not run his style they need someone to pass the ball and when he can not pass the ball which is 75 percent of the game we have problems.
jpark1414::man im going with the hornets to win it all
jpark1414::so how about them hornets
KeMvP277::Watch it
arsenal1470::they are wrong ever since
bigsmiles11::we traded away our superstar and are rebuilding. Devin harris shouldn't be in the league anymroe, nor should Raja. We just need to trade the old dudes and do a full rebuild, not this "try and get the 8th seed" bull$hit.
yodaspeaks::Devin harris shouldnt be in the league anymore.  Thats funny.
Robert Harsh::THERE WHOLE TEAM
21 ShumpStreet::EVERYTHING
yannistoes::lol i knew a ritard once
yannistoes::Inexperience
Caan2184::THEY SUCK, LOSE TO RAPTORS, HORNETS
Robert Harsh::KOBE VS. JAMES, WHO WINS
jpark1414::d wade wins
adamvogltanz::LeBron now, Kobe 5yrs ago
KeMvP277::Adam Morrison
yannistoes::your mom
Robert Harsh::SHUT UP YANNI
21 ShumpStreet::JAZZ FANS, I UNDERSTAND ITS DEPRESSING TO BE FROM UTAH, BUT DONT HATE ON THE KNICKS, THEY DID JUST DISMANTLE YOUR TEAM WITHOUT THEIR TWO BEST PLAYERS
bigsmiles11::ya, nothing but rings ahead for that group lol. Lemme know when you're not the 8th seed below .500.
yannistoes::you're the one hating. go away
packers8652::dwight howard for MVP
Miami Refs Fan::Wow Utah, the whitest player on your team and perhaps the league plays the most minutes, obviously you are going to lose to a 23 loss team.
KeMvP277::Kevin Love is the best PF in the game and he's white so your argument is invalid.
SaintsNO9::Shouldn't you be sucking Lebron's Dick
yannistoes::are you racist?
21 ShumpStreet::HE MAY BE RACIST, BUT HES RIGHT
adamvogltanz::Melo may be the most overrated player in the NBA, no defense playing chucker
nallad47::He is a top 10 scorer not a top 10 player can not play defense can not rebound can not pass..
jpark1414::your an idiot i hate new york and melo and i know that he is a top 10 player in the nba so shut up hater
packfan21mt::Gordon Hayward&gt;Carmelo Anthony
jpark1414::hahaha either way melo wouldnt have allowed his team to lose to the hornets gordon did
jpark1414::gordon hayward lost to the hornets... and melo didnt
packfan21mt::Harris and not playing Burks.
yodaspeaks::What is the Jazz problem?
packfan21mt::hayward's not our problem.
21 ShumpStreet::JARED JEFFRIES &gt; PAUL MILLSAP
yannistoes::Who?
yannistoes::im still drawing a blank... who was he?
21 ShumpStreet::THE GUY WHO SHUT DOWN MILLSAP WHEN THE KNICKS PLAYED THE JAZZ
