jeffcastillo1970::I have bet with a system called Sportsbettingstar. Since I started I make roughly $3,000 a month in profit by following this systems picks. You can find this system on the 1st page of Google by searching for Sports Betting Systems.  Posting this for anyone out there that’s tired of not winning their bets.
Sun Devils-Suns-Cardinals-Diamondbacks-Sun Devils::As many of you know,I have posted the message "Spurs fans suck." many times. So why do I hate the Spurs? Because my Phoenix Suns got SCREWED in 2007. That Amare suspension was totally unfair and unwarranted and it cost the Suns the key game of that series,game 5. It was totally unfair and unwarranted and in may well have cost the Suns the 2007 NBA Championship. After 2007,being a Suns fan gives me no choice but to hate the Spurs.
ulthumbei::What on earth does any of that have to do with Spurs fans?  I'm pretty sure they are not in charge of handing out suspensions.
carlmatrix::you dick?
Sun Devils-Suns-Cardinals-Diamondbacks-Sun Devils::YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! Suns and Sun Devils both win on the same night! It sure feels good to get a win after that bad road trip. Great job tonight Suns. GO SUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
1730 Solutions.::How the Eastern All-Star Point Guards Should Look: Rajon Rondo Jrue Holliday Kyrie Irving  How it will actually look: Rondo Irving Williams Rose* Felton Holliday
bluedevils1148::The coaches are aware of Holiday. The stupid fans only pick the starters.
ganggreengaingreen_oww::lavoy played pretty well, the sixers  just really need a more dominating presence down low to work with the shorter thad. im starting to think bynum will never play in a sixers uniform, to answer the question below
ganggreengaingreen_oww::if hawes was a little more competent the jumbo package of lavoy at PF and Thad at SF would cause some good mismatches against teams
bluedevils1148::Doug compared Lavoy to David West early last year. Look at West and Lavoy's stats for their rookie and sophomore seasons, Lavoy's outplayed him. I feel like Lavoy can break out next year into a double-double guy.
WolfsComing::Any update on Bynum? Is he ever going to play in a Sixers uniform?
PhillyDawg99::I think he has a better chance of joining the PBA tour.
philsphan714::Sixers need a real backup PG now.
Justin36015::Clippers are losing!!!! Yay
ddr34858::Jrue has too much responsibility on this team. Evan needs to be more involved on the offensive side of the ball instead of just standing in the corner.
ganggreengaingreen_oww::yeah i agree, that was iggys problem. but they need him to score and he played well tonight
PhillyDawg99::Remember Neil Funk and Steve Mix on channel 17 back in the day for Sixers road games?
WolfsComing::I can remember back to Bill Campbell and Andy Musser.
PhillyDawg99::A little before my time, but impressive to say the least!
WolfsComing::And Steve Fredericks
ganggreengaingreen_oww::cmon now. had to win this one.
Robbieb7713::Chicago fans are still bitter. No surprise here at least they'll go troll the next team after they lose in the 1st round again.
Igglesnation::You know you've arrived when ppl troll your board

PhillyDawg99::Didn't play down to the Lakers last night though! lol
philsphan714::why do they ALWAYS go to Dorrell at the end of the game. He always seems to airball the shot..obviously it's not the reason for losing.. very sloppy game tonight

CoreyGallagherArt::Said the Bobcats when they beat the Bulls
WolfsComing::Any Sixers fans watching this on Comcast? Not only is the loss breaking my heart but Tom McGuinness just said Zumoff is coming back for the next broadcast. I can't stand him and his "picking up loose change" and " a MAN'S rebound" and "turning garbage into gold"
philsphan714::Philly is lucky to have guys like Zumoff and McGinnis. Lots of guys around the league aren't nearly as good
WolfsComing::Love McGinnis.  Can't stand Zumoff.
PhillyDawg99::Yea, it could always be worse...we could have Tom Heinsohn.
PhillyDawg99::Bring back Mix from Mixville!
FlyGuys623::Zumoff is good
bluedevils1148::I don't know what you guys are talking about, Zumoff is great. So's Malik. I miss Steve Mix a little though.
WolfsComing::Zumoff makes me pine for Chris Wheeler.

ChicagoBulls2013NBAChampions::Stop living in the past fools! Rocky was in 1976, time to move on
KLOE416::Rose won't be the same after his injury
ChicagoBulls2013NBAChampions::your right, he will be better like AP
Igglesnation::Im not even the biggest Flyers fan, but we NEED hockey back for the sake of Philly sports
ChicagoBulls2013NBAChampions::I can't wait till the bulls play the 76ers, beat you guys like last year
Justin36015::Um when was that last year. U guys lost in the first round, so embarrassing
