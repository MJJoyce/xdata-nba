Andrew::If Bargnani puts up between 18 and 25 points per game and pulls down between 7 to 10 boards a game, we have enough of a supporting cast to fill in and pick up the slack. Stat is as good as done. We are going to be ok the next 4 to 6 weeks. Would it not be weird if the Knick's played better with Barnani and Martin at center and when Chandler comes back it throws off the chemistry?
NYkNick::everything will be better when JR get s back and you start playing his brother with the cool tattoo.  but really Woodson thinks wasting a roster spot on the brother is gonna do anything but give JR someone to smoke with.  How bout i smokewith JR and you add a 7footer    damn
I State Facts And You Get Mad::Melo had a good shooting night, that should improve his horrible shooting % so far this season but they play the Spurs next and Melo will prolly shoot 9 - 27 or something like that
Hooch::Why all this hate on the Knicks?   They're still a good team they started bad, so has Chicago.  The season just started!  At least wait till January before you throw in the towel.
NYkNick::Barganani is beasting the boards, the answer to our size problems was right under our nose. Whodadunked it
Jason M::Who said Bargnani cudn't grab boards (8) and defend (5 blocks)...if he can step up big time while chandler is out and with J.R coming back we should be good.
Robert::Stoudemire is very close to needing a walker.
joel::the knicks need to play andrea bringmearing more and world peace
Mr.Jeffery H::The Knicks must start Amar'e Stoudemire at center, Martin at forward, and Peace at tall guard if they want a winning season. Without Stoudemire's 20 pt games they have no chance of getting past the 1st round of the playoffs or even winning tonight.
NYkNick::Amare is to Knicks as Arod is to the yankees.   You have to know when enough is enough
