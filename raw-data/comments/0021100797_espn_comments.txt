Rhubarbjackson::Did all the Jimmer haters not see the Timberwolves game?  LOL.  Rookie year is up and down, but I never saw JJ score 19 his rookie year.
kylejurban::How the heck can the recap say that Nash AND GORTAT sparked the Suns to a victory. LAst I checked, Cousins shot 65% from the floor and scored 41 points. As a Kings fan, I can tell you that Gortat played no role in the suns winning... Cousins made Gortat look like a child. He was AWFUL! Sometimes you need to look past the numbers AP........
phunky58::and trade tyreke and jimmmer already
OFrog::I am thinking trade Jimmer while he has any value left. He is not getting better, and Smart won't increase his value. IT at point, Keep Reke, he swings between pg and sg, and you have Thorton at sg. Huge upgrade with TWill at SF. Dump Garcia already, package him up with Donte, Outlaw and Honeycutt. DMC is locked at PF. Whiteside there to develop. Jason and Chuck man the post, with an upgrade needed there sooner than later. You really have the core of a nice squad, but Maloofs won't spend any more than minimum to build a team, so contending status is out of the question.
phunky58::thats it im getting myself an isaiah thomas sacramento kings jersey
sanctie170::Wow Michael Redd turning back time!
sanctie170::How would the world look today if Redd had signed that offer from Cleveland?
Paul96857::DOn't know Jon3717, Not a rivalry when they don't play often http://bit.ly/HWaxQi
davis in the flesh::ha its halarious that DMC has the same amount of points as lebron in the same night and hes a center
kevrad99::Isn't Cousins looking like a steal with that #5 pick a few years ago?
CosmoKramer1444::Looking like he should have been number one.
Ryan_____Leaf::Solid night for Jimmer. Nearly got a shot in.
zachrlee::The timing for Michael Redd's resurgence could not be better. The Suns need more of his contributions if they hope to have a chance at the last playoff spot.
AZ D-Backs all day::yeahhh buddy!!!
lamriverside11::RAMON SESSIONS VS d-will!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqyU3NKO4Sc

Papa Demba Cisse::<strong>BOOGIE BEASTED <a href="http://hoopsgrind.com/">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYqGK2s6vW4</a> </strong>
-KING--ME-::agree socal
socal2092::Jimmer is a future sixth man of the year, not a star! DMC is star! I still think we have a gem in Jimmer, but IT is better!
OFrog::Jimmer a gem? More like a lump of coal soon to be disgarded. Sixth man? More like out of the NBA.
-KING--ME-::DMC is beasting, and IT and Twill are playing great
Gods are immune to Banhammers FACT::Steve Nash = superhero
Dirtypaulandtheboys::kobe has more clutchness in the tip of his wiener than lebron has in his entire genitalia
TheDags0513::$@% the Jimmer. DMC owns Sacramento.
TheDags0513::OMG. Cousins is an ALL STAR.
Dirtypaulandtheboys::at the end of the day you might touch yourself or you might not, all that really matters though is did you touch someone else?
Dirtypaulandtheboys::i didnt specify WHO i touched
Dirtypaulandtheboys::youve got the wrong dude, dude
laxripper6::you dont think serena is hot?
laxripper6::she does not look like a man you moron
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::Remember: Sports junkies rule and news hounds suck.
Turd_Stanfurdgesson::Where did all the Jimmer jockriders go after he had one stinking good game yesterday?  ONE good game?  IT here to stay!  Deal with it!
Rhubarbjackson::Where did all the haters go when he had the good game?  Also he tied his season high that game so I guess there is more than just one.  Get over your hate, it is lame as hell.
SacramentoRemixx::sounds like you riding I.T'S D-I-C-K....root for the kings not one player!! is jimmer not a kingZ?? we'll support him
-KING--ME-::wow kobe got a very lucky bounce
laxripper6::serena williams &gt; insert women here
Dirtypaulandtheboys::haha oh i see now
oinkpiggies::buddy, she looks LIKE A MAN. EW.
SacramentoRemixx::oh well i just hoped the hollywood flakers lose to the nest!!
SacramentoRemixx::Feels like we got beat by the bobcats....knaw not even cause the bobcats play defense!! we had too many unforced t.o's ...the suns stink and we will be in the playoffs b4 you faggbacks ever set foot in the post season
MatthewCornwell::Its almost like the Kings got beat by a team as horrendously awful as...the Kings.
Encaladitos::Sry to break it to you Kings are just as bad as suns if not worse scary part is Sac has alot of Young players but only a few actually show signs of improvements.
SacramentoRemixx::almost true!! we do have more talent than the suns but you fail to realize you cant spot potential in a team you dont watch....take it from me, the suns are a doormat team that lucks up more than it flatout beats a team.. #truestory
Casey_Tatum::your life must be a complete misery.
SacramentoRemixx::Not even close guy! Im feeling like a King everyday ...cant say for you
TheBigAZ151680::Only if suns played like this in the first half of the season
TheBigAZ151680::^ eww
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::Those DAMN home losses to the Hornets and Raptors. If we just win those two games we should have won,we've got a much better shot to get it.
SacramentoRemixx::the suns need tim tebow!!
ImGonnaGetYouSucka4::<b> Thurmanator follows females around ESPN boards harassing them like the little boy he is.  Pathetic.</b>
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::It would be so awesome if the Suns were to make the playoffs and beat the Spurs in a series. The two best things that can happen in the NBA are that the Suns can win a playoff series and the Spurs can lose a playoff series. It would be great to have them both happen in the same series.
laxripper6::serena williams is so sexy
sweetdigs::You should lay off the drugs.  The Williams sisters are men.  Or... I suppose that might explain it.
Im ragin::I'D WAX THAT ASS

Im ragin::HE SAID HE WAS ELITE NOT THE BEST
Im ragin::FUCKIN DELUSIONAL
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::He's not. Brees,Rodgers,Brady,Manning,Manning and Stafford are all better.
Im ragin::WAY BETTER
TubbyTime334::Suns Win!!! Make The Playoffs!
