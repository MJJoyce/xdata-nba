Commenter::Next Heat game the possibility of careers in the Hot Dog stand business will be reviewed. Can you think of a better team of candidates to be handling Hot Dogs all day long. The job satisfaction for handling meat would be endless
fcbonilla::On the way to play the Indiana Pacers, first we have to deal with the Utah Jazz. Bring it on.
Commenter::Wade is also good at protecting the balls, he has Lebron cup them.
whoaaa::Alec Burks can straight up play, if his outside shot gets consistent this guy will be dropping 20 a night
Commenter::which is bigger? Lebron's hand or Wade's sausage? Only two people know the answer to that question.
Jay::The Heat are smart. They stroll through the regular season, then turn it up during playoffs.  Not good for fans that want to see the full team play, but it works for them.  They'll win it all again this year.  Too many players that can take over the game.  Never seen a team with this many superstars before.
fcbonilla::Next, bring on the Pacers!
stephen::james can play any position
Coach Carter::Lebron, make it triple double. cmon man, just one more assist and rebound. finish the job.
Jabari::Going for 30?
