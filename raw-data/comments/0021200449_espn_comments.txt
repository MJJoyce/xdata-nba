WeAreTheMenInBlack::The Spurs have beaten the Mavs by a combined 63 points in their last two meetings.  Ouch!
luvnbayes::So Ginobili has "dramatically lost a step"?  What nonsense.  He's scored 43 points in his last 48 minutes.  He does not finish around the rim as well as he did 5 years ago, but his savvy, instincts, and pure desire to win are as good as ever.  And what a joy it has been to watch him play this last decade.
DalvinSplit::Here they come the Elite team San Antonio Spurs.
TexAugMan::Mark Cuban is getting restless!
CoconutFaninFlorida::slam_dunk_on_u Didn't the spurts had a 20-Game winning streak (regular season + playoffs) and it didn't matter when the OKC Thunder beat the crap out of them? ------------------------------------------------------------------------- You just proved why the Clippers winning streak means nothing.
nba is the worst::And why Joey Crawford should be prohibited from officiating Spurs playoff games
OHthenowTX::the problem of other NBA Team  fans have with the SPUR fans is that unlike many cities we Love our team and support our team win or lose.  we do not waste our breath for whatever team we are playing but use it to inspire our team.  It makes it a tough place for whatever team is in town.  We also travel well, so they say, and support them on the road. Now Dallas's problem is an owner with a ton of of money who seamingly thinks he knows basketball as a micro manager.  Fact in point.  Having the best record in the Western Conference a few years ago with Coach Johnson but not winning it all that year and letting him go.  Now the team in Brookyln has the same type of management style with an owner with the same deep pockets  and that owner was even quicker to micro manage. LOOK  where' Dallas's  record has gone since A. J. was fired!
CoconutFaninFlorida::An owner with a ton of money who thinks he can just go out and buy championships by overpaying has-been players.
cardsownthecuse::My Mavs need to hang it up and just try for a top 10 pick this year.
Chris31708::Didn't the 2008 Houston Rockets go do undefeated for a month?  The Clippers win streak will mean nothing come playoffs.
slam_dunk_on_u::fa...ggo.t
Vaquero In The House::Show you what a real slam dunk is...........
Vaquero In The House::Meet me at Staples &amp; l'll show you.  Pull you by the ears while you swallow......who loves you baby....
Vaquero In The House::slam_drunk is punk Faker fan who I called out last season, asking him to meet me in Lakerland &amp; he never showed up.  Woopi boy talks a lot of BS but can't put up....can't shut up either because he's a Woopi, if you know what I mean...  Hey Woopi suck me!
slam_dunk_on_u::How are your "vaqueros" doing ?  Oh I see they just got eliminated from playoff contention LOL
slam_dunk_on_u::Cry me a river b!tches
Paul78655::slam dunk is trolling for homosexual lovers. hes not a troll. just a balding $@%.
zZ_TRUSPURZ_Zz::Slam go get some Nasty
TechnicalFoul2::DO NOT FEED THE TROLL!...
slam_dunk_on_u::Didn't the spurts had a 20-Game winning streak (regular season + playoffs) and it didn't matter  when the OKC Thunder beat the crap out of them?
slam_dunk_on_u::Chris31708 - Aren't fans of all elite teams arrogant? I'm pretty sure Laker fans are 10X more arrogant.  ------------------------------------  I would understand that if the spurts were still a championship threat...but they are not since 2007 ....so I don't see why spurt fans behave this way...your team have not done jack in 5 or 6 years (counting this one too)
Chris31708::Aren't fans of all elite teams arrogant?  I'm pretty sure Laker fans are 10X more arrogant.
slam_dunk_on_u::I'm not a Clippers fan but don't try to discredit their winning streak dude...because i can discredit the spurts winning streak as well...you see spurt fans are arrogant...thats why I dislike your team
slam_dunk_on_u::Chris31708 - You hate the Spurs don't you?  -----------------------  I don't hate them I just dislike their fans for arrogant and cocky...
Chris31708::You hate the Spurs don't you?
slam_dunk_on_u::Just like the spurts record  in the regular season will mean squat once the playoffs begin...same story every year
slam_dunk_on_u::CHOKE CHOKE CHOKE!!!!
Horn Nation21::Whose bright idea was it to bring Dirk back before he was ready?  He can either be a very crappy role player that serves at best as a distraction or be the star and soul of the team depending on his form.  I continue to see no reason why he had to come back early, it's not helping anyone.
Eg214::I think its time to hit the panic button
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::thank you for the silence, I win!! hahah mahahah bye losers..
Vaquero In The House::That's because intelligent people know when to be quite when dealing with morons however morons like yourself are just too stupid to know when to shut the fk up.  You &amp; as slam_dumb should team up, both of you are idiots anyway!!  Go Spurs Go!!
CoconutFaninFlorida::Well it was nice talking to you Spurs fans. I'm out. See ya.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::you stink, dont ever come back..
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::I won here.hahaha you guys suck!!!
CoconutFaninFlorida::Looks like the Spurs are back on track. That's 5 in a row now.
GoofyTigre::Looked good in their last 5 also.. Pop is managing their minutes well and I foresee yet another 50 win season and another late postseason push..
GoofyTigre::I can see 60 for sure, but 50 is the record line which we have set over the last 15 seasons. Just want to make sure we extend that first then look toward 60 and the #1 seed.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::False, you live in your own world..
CoconutFaninFlorida::I'm going out on a limb and saying the Spurs will easily win 60 games.
Pro Troll::must suck to be a rockets fan. 0-3 this year against spurs.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::not at all, they will fail in  the playOFFS
CoconutFaninFlorida::Don't feed him.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::..and yet, noone in the world cares outside of san nuts so old
CoconutFaninFlorida::Goofy, we got it. Don't even reply to her comments. Just ignore.
GoofyTigre::Rockets BEAT Los Angeles Lakers is a troll.. DO NOT FEED THE TROLL!
CoconutFaninFlorida::Funny how Parker is almost never mentioned in the MVP race.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::hes 30, looks 40 now...old...
GoofyTigre::Rockets BEAT Los Angeles Lakers is a troll.. DO NOT FEED THE TROLL!
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::san antonio should not even have a basketball team and should be bought out by Las Vegas or something or some other lame city anything is better then san an to oh no!!
GoofyTigre::Rockets BEAT Los Angeles Lakers is a troll.. DO NOT FEED THE TROLL!
reysmith11::thats fine with me... in the end... they would still wooop that rocket's assss.
CoconutFaninFlorida::Reysmith, don't reply to the troll-virgin. Don't feed him.
CoconutFaninFlorida::I love when trolls get desperate and start liking their own comments.
GoofyTigre::He hasn't just started liking his own comments, he has been doing it all along.
CoconutFaninFlorida::Houston sports teams absolutely suck. Can't wait for the Texans to get bounced in the playoffs and the Astros to lose 120+ games. Oh, and the Rockets to miss the playoffs and finish as the 9th seed.
tangledblue3::Can't wait for a proper hurricane to blow you and the rest of that sorry state out to sea.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::san antonio should not even have a basketball team and should be bought out by Las Vegas or something or some other lame city  anything is better then san an to oh no!!
reysmith11::SPURS bench VS ROCKETS starters. SPURS still would win.
GoofyTigre::Rockets BEAT Los Angeles Lakers is a troll.. he probably doesn't even like Houston. He just wants to have a name that incites the most amount of comments. It was created 12/26 so he was probably banned from his last account.. stop feeding the TROLL!
reysmith11::U mad bro?
CoconutFaninFlorida::Easily.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::foreigners dont do much in San Antonio anyway..
CoconutFaninFlorida::Remember when Harden did well in the finals?   Me neither.
tangledblue3::Coconutsinyer mouth, I' ve seen plenty of players have bad finals, but it wasn't cuz they had a 'fragile mentality'. Kobe was horrible in 04. Does he have a 'fragile mentality'? LBJ in the 2011 finals. Fragile mentality? Ray Allen in the 2010 finals. Sometime you have a rough stretch, even in the biggest moments.
GoofyTigre::Harden is a baller. Fun to watch. Now that he has his own team it is going to be fun to see what he can do going forward with Lin.
CoconutFaninFlorida::Harden is a baller with a fragile mentality.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::you got 3 potential HOF and have not won since 2005...(noone cares about the year) when do nba fans want to see the spurs  in the finals??  NEVER!!
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::The one thing that Spurs fans don't get is this:  Noone likes you Noone want to see you play basketball you are a city of foreigners you have nothing but foreigners on your team you suck!!
CoconutFaninFlorida::They suck? What does that make the 16-14 Rockets who might not even make the playoffs?
GoofyTigre::Stop responding to the Troll who likes his own comments and he will go away. He has nothing better to do than goad you into comments that he can make stupid replies to. Just let him go. He is getting his rocks off with every response you give him.
CoconutFaninFlorida::How's J-Brick doing by the way?
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::more likeable ...with J lin and J HArd!!
AlphaBeta123::lol mavs suck.  So Dirk was out before, what's the excuse now?
tangledblue3::Sorry, but it's true. When the Spurs are in the finals, ratings are way down. They are boring and have been for a decade. They win a lot due to their big 3 and a good coach (even if he lies his $@% off), but also cuz the NBA is crummy with too many d-league quality players. If you put together a team with three solid guys (and one arguably the best pf ever), you can sustain the kind of success they have. Too often their offense is just waiting for Duncan to post, then throw him the ball, and he takes 6-8 sec. to make his move. It works, but it isn't exciting.
reysmith11::Houston sucks. only 2 titles. when will be the next one? never. LMAO
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::noone gives a phuc k about fundamentals..if I had that nickname, I would retire immediately for causing frequent BOREgasms!
CoconutFaninFlorida::Too bad those fundamentals brought San Antonio 4 NBA titles.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::not if it was the boring spurs..
GoofyTigre::He's a troll.. doing a pretty good job at getting people to respond. pretty entertaining though. just solidifying my opinion on the Rockets' fanbase though.
reysmith11::LMAO.. this kid.
CoconutFaninFlorida::The boring Spurs? You must be a 12 year old who thinks dunking is the only point in basketball. Its called fundamentals, kid.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::noone gives a p huck...just dont show up in the finals and let everyone down, spurs..
GoofyTigre::It is better than no titles since 1995.
CoconutFaninFlorida::Grammar school has failed you.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::spurs fans will look forward to no title since 2005...
CoconutFaninFlorida::Oops, you mean 2007? Dumb Rockets troll.
GoofyTigre::rethink that one for a second and then edit your 2005 to 2007.
killahbeezle::How bout dem Cowboys!!! #CowboyNation #StandUp #3Picks #SitDown
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::cowboys make even rookie Quarter backs like RG III look like 1st ballot hall of famers!!
Antsea91::spurs fans = worst in the league yes even worse than lakers fans
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::lovers hate BOREgasms...the ones the Spurs administer...
kungfupandatennis::haters hate greatness.
Rockets BEAT Los Angles Lakers::thank youuu
676Rob::damn romo, damn
tangledblue3::More like 'damn defense, damn'. They gave up 200 yards to one back. Rob Ryan and his brother are the most overrated coaches in the league and all teams should avoid them like the plague.
no look high five::.....sigh.
Emoney321.000::alright guys, i'm out. You guys are pretty cool. see ya around
Maniacpkt::i'm going to go and find a different way to waste my life, see ya next game.    Spurs fans are the classiest in the league

Emoney321.000::LMAO. probably the best one anyone's come up with so far
Emoney321.000::no problem
SPURZWARZ1.0::Thanks
Tim Duncan Still Has It::Well good night guys, I'm getting off. Going to watch some nice television.
apbelen26::Mavs fan here, great game by San Antonio, and just hoping we find a gem with the lottery pick we'll get this season (barring some miraculous turnaround)
Maniacpkt::thunder has your draft pick

Tim Duncan Still Has It::You're contradicting yourself. Wouldn't it be us getting under your skin if you're flagging all of us?
slam_dunk_on_u::Tim Duncan Still Has It - Just goes to show how trolls get mad. Goes even as far to show you how much of a bad troll he is.  ------  Not mad at all I love getting under spurt fans skin....
Tim Duncan Still Has It::Just goes to show how trolls get mad. Goes even as far to show you how much of a bad troll he is.
Emoney321.000::gross, they just showed dez bryant's $@%. What do they think, that slamdunkonyou is the only one watching the game
SPURZWARZ1.0::Lol, he's probably drooling!
Maniacpkt::wow, boston is terrible.  how long until they blow that team up?
tangledblue3::They said the same thing last year, then they came within one win of the finals with four players out and Allen limping around the floor.
Maniacpkt::not soon enough
SPURZWARZ1.0::Maybe next year
SPURZWARZ1.0::Slamspunkonyou's wife is an actress, she's the one who holds up the "eat more chikin'" sign!
Tim Duncan Still Has It::Wife? I'm still confused.
Maniacpkt::they assume too much
Lt. Frag::LMFAO!
slam_dunk_on_u::Another touchdown by Washington...  Bye Bye Cowgirls lol and spurt fans who follow this team
slam_dunk_on_u::watch your words ...you may get banned

ForeverGrapeOKC::The sad thing is.....Romo will be the QB next season anyway
tangledblue3::Jones needs to give it up. He's a cancer on the team. These old egomaniacs ruin lots of franchises. But oh well, my Broncos are riding high.
Emoney321.000::sadly for the jets, sanchez will probably be their QB
Emoney321.000::if the jets get rid of rex, then sanchez will probably go, too

slam_dunk_on_u::Maniacpkt - btw, Thunder royally ripped the rockets off this year  ------  Just like they Thunder ripped the spurts a few games ago LOL

Sam58548::Double ouch
144485::FIRE RICK CARLISLE  Where is the accountability,   like i said after the blowout against Denver,  NOT ONE PLAYER IS GOING TO FIX THIS TEAM,  you can't just trade players and hope the return will produce  PERSONALLY!!  I would rather have us lose our next 10 games and have a new coach who actually benches players when they make selfish plays and turn the ball over with the STUPID moves and passes that are made.
tangledblue3::Where is the loyalty to a coach who helped bring you the only title you've ever had?!
SPURZWARZ1.0::Slamspunkonyou talks so much $hit, he uses an ENEMA BAG to gargle!
Lt. Frag::He is an enema bag!
