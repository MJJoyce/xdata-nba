Cyril::Players drafted after Austin Rivers who have been at least marginally better so far:  Jeremy Lamb, John Henson, Mo Harkless, Terrence Jones, Andrew Nicholson, Evan Fournier, Jared Sullinger, Tony Wroten, Miles Plumlee, Jeff Taylor, Jae Crowder, Draymond Green, Orlando Johnson, Khris Middleton, Tyshawn Taylor, Mike Scott, and Kyle O'Quinn.
Tex Rubinstein::I wouldn't normally make this claim, but the Blazers totally got this one. After the disappointing loss to Minnesota they could beat anyone, anywhere today. Which is BAD NEWS for New Orleans playing in Portland.
Mike::so sorry blazer haters....you lost again...hey look at the bright side they for sure will lose sometime and then you can say...x...team is better....hit the road chumps.
Trace Mann::Sweet Blazers squeak out a win in a "trap game"....Rip City!
Darlene::Go Blazers!  We have the greatest team ever!!
Henry::when will Monty be fired? hopefully soon.  Awful coach.  Terrible rotations and Xs and Os and poor motivator.  How many losses will it take? Look at his 4 yr record.  Awful.  Maybe the worst coach in the NBA.
Henry::AND.... Monty loses another one for the Pelicans! Terrible clock management at the end and he didn't get his starters in early enough in the 4th... no one in the game at the end had any kind of rhythm
CptSnark::Game day and still no comments?
Seattle Blows!::come on N.O. beat the blazers.
Scott::Better win this one if you want to keep pace with the Thunder.  Looking forward to watching the Thunder beat you'll by double figures at the Peake.
