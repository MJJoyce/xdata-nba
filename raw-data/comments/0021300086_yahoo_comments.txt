Chris Ona::To think the Magic are playing decently even without Tobias Harris who is out with an injury.
PKM::Orlando has been a tough team to figure out this year.  One day they beat the Heat, next they lost to the Celtics at home.
hoss_hoss_777::You got to watch these teams with no ball hog celebrity star to keep happy, they will beat you with team work. Still don't get to excited just yet, MAGIC management and ownership have plenty of time left to sink totally the season.
dc::go hawks
Anton::Magic only show up against powerhouse teams lol...
Rico M::Looks like Nikola Vucevic was still tired from that monster game he had the other day.
Dark horse::what the hell happened to Vuc tonight?
ricky::and by heat you mean Clippers?
