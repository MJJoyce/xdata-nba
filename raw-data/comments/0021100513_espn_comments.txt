Javale Macgee::damn wizards cant win
bobby30303::Lin keeps winning but can he match 150 MPG? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmlTrVha3M8
tomikah23::john wall doesn't have it
_REDSKINS_richie::averages more assist than westbrook you $@%!
ElArtman1973::4 assists for a pg means he is not very good, 33 points means we all know who will be shooting the ball, makes it easier to defend
mtahokie11::hahaahahah yeah he doesn't have it..shitted on the magic 33...i was doubting his game earlier this year but hes got it together now
bbomberguy::He still isnt that good 1 he needs to do more consistently
bk the king::The wizards like the Nets have 2 scoring options and thats it. Wall and Crawford do whatever they gotta do. Everyone else stands around. If there is any success worthy team in the future they have got to develop their depth.
todogg15::lin was going to be traded to the raptors day before nets game then knicks decided to give him one last chance. more details here: http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
tbest23::Did Wall do the Dougie?
KingGeorge53::John Wall   o^O   what a game.
hulKKNUPE::Was Justin Harper on the bench???? Didn't even see him on "DNP because of coach's decision" list.
choate_sedition::Wall is going to be better than D. Rose, he'sa better athelete, stronger, quicker, more explosive.  I don't know if he wants it like Rose does though.
_REDSKINS_richie::your dumb^
mawright04::Rose and Westbrook are more athletic.  Look up the NBA combine stats
DTangMF::No he wont
aks4434::If Washington drafted Lin instead of Wall last year they would be 10 games over .500.
mtahokie11::your an idiot. Look at the Wizards record no 1 point guard could bring us to the .500 mark
KingGeorge53::You could say that with just about any team.   The problem is Lin's team isn't 10 games over .500 now.
mtahokie11::Randy Whitman is the smartest coach. Finally someone benches Mcgee's $@%!$@% and Nick young. THANK YOU. Mcgee is the weakest defender in the league. He doesn't box out and does the stupidest $@%! on offense and has no post game. Keep those cancers out of the line up
todogg15::its crazy how little media attention this has gotten. In this years D-LEAGUE DUNK CONTEST 6 foot 2 Kevin Dobbs did a through the legs dunk over three ppl with a blindfold!! In my opinion its the best dunk ever. Check out the vid of it here http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
fliptide..::stop spamming us with your lameass website!  besides...D LEAGUE?  who the fuck cares!!  gtfo!
mclean0202::Randy Wittman is a $@%. His track record is awful! and for a reason! You cant just give up on young guys with so much ability and potential. Go ahead Wittman, bench Javale McGee one of the best post shot blocking forces in the game! Have fun giving up over 100 points every single game you moron!
mtahokie11::Mcgee is such a bad defender. doesn't box out and leads the league in goaltending. did you watch how much we played without Mcgee and young out????  trade blatche and Mcgee and young
dilanjackson::magic def $@%!$@ the line
pokernutty87::+8.5 love it baby
Magicmike321::Is this working yet???
SamC9500::see potential.  a solid group of hard workers with javale mcgee/andray blatche on the bench.  give us a future vets, a 2-3 solid drafts, stan van as coach and i say we can be 8th seed potential.  maybe even win another playoff series around 2014 #wh #httr
MagicBoltzRays::THREE STARS 1. Anderson 2. Redick 3. Howard
Qster15::Magic still haven't learned.. DON'T give the ball to J. Nelson in the last minute of play...this guy is pathetic
loveduke069::magic stink they deserve nothing for howard and hope they got nothng for the monkey
loveduke069::who is in NC?
mjedwards95::Duke sucks dick and so does the state of N.C. Home of the hillbillies
dilanjackson::magic just $@%!$@ the line!!, why foul
dilanjackson::completely $@%!$@ my multi
TY LAWSON 3::nuggets - blazers board is lagging so bad
fliptide..::somebody needs to fire Van Gundy
TheOrlandoTragic::lmao Hedo
fliptide..::This game is a f**king disgrace.  Why isnt the Magic up by 20 points?
DCsportsAreCursed::holy lag time batman  clearly stamkos' fault
DCsportsAreCursed::y u no let me post
cmonson3::Obama would play better alongside Wall than those Scrubs. Wizards suck.
fliptide..::...yet the Magic had to battle to the very end..  Magic suck even more
MagicBoltzRays::so a 30+ minute delay for posts to show up?
DCsportsAreCursed::wizards are a funny team
Mikepokeefe::31 points, 0 turnovers for Wall. Wow.
RyanAndersonShouldBeInTheAllStarGame::If this God forsaken comment ever goes through: Seriously, Magic? Struggling with the Wizards? Almost as pathetic as this message board lag.
MagicalDiesel::Looks like ESPN can't even load posts anymore
TheOrlandoTragic::This is the worst game I've ever watched.
loveduke069::score
loveduke069::there gross
terrapin5dixon::Welcome to a world where JaVale Mcgee is playing toe to toe with Dwight Howard..
redscapswizfan::where is Mcgee
Mia6mia3::how's the wizzy wizzards???
bjohns55::redick sixth man of THE year
mtahokie11::lets go wizzz
bjohns55::redick sixth man of THE year
mtahokie11::lets go WIZZZZ
openminded43::Hey Magic brass...... see what a LEGIT PG can do???
oneandonlybabe::What is going on with ESPN boards today?
oneandonlybabe::C'mon Magic you shouldn't be allowing the Wizz to hang so close...
openminded43::This is where the Wizards should gain ground, not lose it!!!
MagicBoltzRays::SORRY TROLLS. The Magic aren't losing to the wizards.
loveduke069::magic suck!!!!
Paul Revere and The Raiders::Howard has checked out, a few more games and he'll start sitting
