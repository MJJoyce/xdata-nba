Jabari::Exciting.
Ali::This is why drafted lance stephenson in my fantasy team... contract year and more opportunities most definitely a good year from him.

Neorlyns::PAul George is overrated...MVP and a Superstar no way he is still a raw...
Devin H::Josh Helium-Head Smith, Drummond and Greg Monroe have potential to be  avery tough front line...  If only Dumars hadnt hired Rashweed Wallace to coach the big men

fcbonilla::I think that the Pacers were so focused on playing the Heat on Wednesday that they forgot that they had a game against the Pistons.
Knickschamp Tumblr Com::I can't think of any team that won a championship ring without a star except for the Pistons. In other words, the hillbillies has no chance at all to win a ring.
KUSH MASTER::Freaking Drummond!  3 Fouls in less than 4 minutes. I need you to grab me 15 boards tonight..
Jabari::Anyone else think that the Pacers have already lost?
