Impactive::It was nothing but a lack of conditioning.  There's nothing more to it folks, the ran out of steam like a deflating balloon!
RH936::One game doesn't make a whole season but body language says alot. Howard wants out and is trying to protect his image before the Magic fans turn on him. Otis Smith must make a decision.
Bulls greater than all teams::You are a physicic.
Blessed is thine Tebow::Time to trade Howard, he obviously doesn't give a rat's a$$ about the Magic, and they are doing themselves a disservice. The Magic would be better off sending Howard to Miami then to keep that selfish monkey on their team.
Impactive::Time for a break in the insanity of the Howard story.  In this latest blog/article I offer up an interesting perspective of the Orlando Magic.  It worth taking a peek, after running the numbers, even if the Magic dont deal Howard, they can still get far enough under the cap to sign a big FA or two next season.  Check it out, and Magic fans it may be the good news you've been waiting for in this soap opera!  Spread the word and Happy New Year!  http://mbd.scout.com/mb.aspx?s=305&amp;f=2172&amp;t=8480118
Lakersfan1977::It's amazing how easily Durant scores. It didn't even seem like he was impacting the game all that much, you look at the box score when the game ends, and he's got 30, while shooting a great percentage. Could have scored even more if he'd been his usual self from the free throw line.
Tampabayallday37::Howard is in Orlando for the time being. GET OVER IT!!!
All.He.Does.Is.Win::"That's the beauty of the soap opera. How it plays out, we'll wait and see."  -- David Stern  what a delta bravo.
Jim_Shoe732::I dont feel bad for Dwight at all, he could have came to Chicago and chose not to, he can rot in basketball hell in Orlando
theprodctz::Bring back the Sonics!
asoltanizad::LOL I cant wait till your team is in decline then well see how much of a great fanbase you guys really are. When the sonics were in seattle they were in rebuild mode for the future which in every team alot of people wont be too excited for to go and watch and lose. We see this in every team like the clippers, hawks etc and even the hornets now. Its not that we are bad fans is just the nba being stupid and relocating a team from one of the top ten cities in america to a crap city like OKC.
WIkalikalou::How are the Sonics this year?
xaionxav::If you had supported the team when they were in Seattle you would still have them. Too bad your city blows
donkeyman05::Exactly.  They didn't take the time to look up from their lattes to see that their team was being taken to a city that will actually show some support.
jano2412::Go back in your grave!
marvin alston::Hold on Kobe Howards coming
FewL4no1::Who's Kobe Howard?
marvin alston::is it me or does howard look like he would rather be playing somewhere else
CosmoKramer1444::Someone needs to straighten out Big Baby. 6 points,5 boards, 3-9 FG(4 of those misses were jumpers).  Classic Baby. Bass on the other hand...............
1522scooter::Howard need a number one offensive option because he cannot be that guy. That is not his strength. He's a rebounder and a defender--not a scorer. He needs D Rose. He lands in Chicago and the Heat can forget it.
jtric19632004::lmao---the reason orlando is a loser is because they have two duke guards(duhon and reddick) on their team.
CandySparker::Kevin Do Run !
Patriots-2012-NFL-Champions::Rajon Rondo for  2011-2012  NBA  MVP:  #1 in assists, #1 in steals, #3 in points  The Great Rajon Rondo has 31 points per game, 5 steals per game, 13 assists per game, and 5 rebounds per game.

BigDSports21::Wonder if Howard is actually packing it in.  It's pretty odd to see Dwight Howard have less shot attempts than Ryan Anderson.
Need4Speed95::<b>Wonder where Howard will land</b>
marvin alston::hes going to the lakers
sambo8686::Since Lopez is out for 2 months, I think their out of the running. Mav's or Lakers will get him I think. Who do the mav's have to trade if Lakers sent Bynum and Gasol to Orlando?
Need4Speed95::<b>Would change the entire team for the better though, they need to go after him big time for sure.</b>
Need4Speed95::<b>Naw, doubt it</b>
swagopotamus3::LAL
sambo8686::barring injury, I am going with Thunder/Heat finals. The west is watered down this year and I think Clippers will contend next year after a semi-full season together.
sambo8686::I can agree with that. I think Indiana had a sleeper off-season and could make a run in the playoffs. I don't think a championship run but they could knock off a team in the 1st round.
swagopotamus3::1 of these 4 from EC:  Chicago, Miami, NYK (Sleeper Pick: Indiana)  1 of these 3 from the WC:  OKC, LAC, LAL
jimjam1234::Orlando needs to start Nelson, Richardson, Anderson, Davis and Howard. Davis was the best pickup of free agency and they have him backing up an undersized Anderson. Anderson plays like a 3 and would be a matchup problem for most teams at that position. Put Davis out there with Howard to take some of the pressure off him and it's a whole new ballgame. They've got the pieces they're just not using them correctly. It's time for Van Gundy to go.
marvin alston::he doesnt want to stay anymore...thats kinda obvious to us non-magic fans
Need4Speed95::<i>You definitely try to keep him</i>
Need4Speed95::<b></b>Why would you trade him, makes no sense...you build around him..he's the foundation of the teamd.<i></i>
swagopotamus3::Orlando needs to trade Howard and start building for the future.
cardinals2329::why is it 1:40 and i just now heard OKC beat orlando? i didn't even know this was one of the games today. ESPN needs to do a much better job promoting OKC, they gotta be at least top 2 in the west
Masta _McNasty::Howard is whiny..Throws his teammates under the bus...Horrible FT shooter..Turns it over way too much and is mentally weak. Why would Orlando want that as their superstar player?  Get rid of the bum and let another team realize how overrated he is.  Oh and he has a basketball IQ of 0 and is a terrible passer.  As a Magic fan who watches him every game..He's is soooooooooooooooooooooo overrated.
Masta _McNasty::As a Magic fan..Please trade Howard for Pau and Bynum.. Howard is overrated..Orlando would be a better team with Pau and Bynum... Oh and L.A.... PLEASE TAKE TURKOLSER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GatorRays::Pack it in Orlando, play for the pick.
rrballer34::if k.d. avgs more than 5 assists a game and okc are 1 seed shuld he be mvp?
Dented_rim::NO  Every MVP demands the ball in the last 5 minutes - Durant just hangs out 25 feet from the hoop and waits for kick outs...no drama there. I can only think of one game late last year where Durant had the ball early in the possessions and he actually delivered.  KD's career assists is 2.7
MissBikini::It's a two team race this year. Not much drama. Thunder will play the Heat in June. It's inevitable.
Dented_rim::Injuries will determine who does what - always does. This season is so messed up I still don't even know who is on what teams - the NBA is all about profits these days (and they still stink at it), every teams bench turns over every two years (no vets) - the fact Nick Collison had to sign for half his worth shows how unstable the league is.
masala716::I wouldn't sleep on Memphis either.  They lost Darrel Arthur but they're still a much improved team with Rudy Gay.
DTangMF::How about the Clippers playing the Heat?
Dented_rim::34 turnovers, 47 fouls, 47 three point shots - if that wasn't Rat-ball then I don't know what is. Every time I'd flip over from the Packers v Bears game the action would stop for a foul...gave up on this game after 1 quarter...no fan of basketball needs to watch this - get the women and children out of the room before they see any more carnage.  I could have sworn I used to like the NBA...ho ho ho.
P.C..::http://www.digital1radio.com/ featured video at the top. check it out
Vanilla_Ice_1::I like Howard, but he's overrated.  No offensive game whatsoever.
alewadan1::Howard got shut down by Kendrick Perkins.
BigBee94::LMAO ! If you think Howard is overrated than you are crazy if anything Howard is underrated. I watched the game and i can tell you Howard didn't have the energy in him today. he wants to be traded and really doesnt like playing in Orlando because his teamates and gm sucks
P.C..::dunks (points) and rebounds.. somebodys gotta do it
KingGeorge53::Thunder
y32211y::who?
Dented_rim::Thunder starters minus 17 in the +/-, Magic starters minus 13 in the +/-....looks like the bench players should ask for a raise.  only 65 games to go - the Jewish basketball league would rather make money off of 15 bad games than let them actually practice - would you go watch a band that only practiced one week....oh, that's right, the younger generations bands just lip sync anyway. Tis the season for the NBA to fake it...ho ho ho.
KingGeorge53::The team that just embarrassed the Magic.
tampasportsrule::All I know is that I called this Magic LOSS tonight folks. I told you all that they had NO chance to win this game. NONE. I also said that Anderson would be their leading scorer in the blowout LOSS. I also said that Howard would wind up scoring less than 12 points. Easy call to make and I made it correctly. I made a bundle as well. Next.
Dented_rim::and your point is? gamblers lose more than they win - otherwise they wouldn't take your bets.
SupaFlySupreme::The fact that Howard is the best big man in the league is disgraceful.
jw32988::Anyone with half a brain can tell he isn't trying. He wants to be traded and thinks that by ruining the Magic's season that they will trade him.
Dented_rim::True; Howard wouldn't make an All Star team in the 80's and 90's - the Lakers bench in the 80's would be a play off team today.  Howard should have 18 shots a game and the Magic should have a weak side power forward permanently stationed on the opposite low block...but Van Grungy can't coach and players today can't be coached - what ya gunna do? The Magic cast up 28 three pointers, many in te first 10 seconds of the shot clock...the NBA is just bad hoops...3 point line killed team ball.
SupaFlySupreme::Anyone with a basketball IQ can tell Howard is vastly limited at offense, even though he's arguably the best physical prospect since Shaq at center and performs like he does is shameful. Howard wouldn't even make a All-Star game in the 90's/early 00's.  And that last statement just made me shoot eggnog out of my nose
OklahomaDrew::because you don't like his point output?  Maybe it just says something about the competition amongst big men in the league
SupaFlySupreme::What you doing here? The womens' gymnastics forum is on "other sports" tab
hoofhearted30::nah, because he lost a bet and is trying to find a way to justify it. Most outlandish statements on these boards are by failed gamblers.
Luclongley_MVP::Did anyone actually think the Thunder would lose this game?  If i was a gambler, i would have bet my house on the Thunder winning.
OklahomaDrew::favored by 9... won by 8...
DTangMF::Its easier to say after the game is over...moron
Luclongley_MVP::Go look at the first 100 or so posts.  I have been saying it since the schedule was announced that the Thunder were going to win.
Golf Jock::Not sure why so many fans like Howard so much.  On offense he is so one dimensional that he will lose big games for you.  Sure, great defender.  But all he knows how to do on offense is dunk the ball.  You put a big body on him, like Perkins, and his offense will drop way off.
SupaFlySupreme::A 20ppg (at highest) "superstar" center is laughable.
OklahomaDrew::Maybe he should stick to golf
DTangMF::Only Dunk the ball? Really? U never see him do hook shots (Right or Left hand), never see him do bank shots?
DTangMF::Orlando will bounce back
booskiebooskie98::thunder all the way!!!!!  #teamdurant
DaBostonStrangler10::#itssofuckingannoying
Juniper Trees::Seriously.
coleward50::please dont hashtag in a post ever again-Everyone
OklahomaDrew::hahahaha
