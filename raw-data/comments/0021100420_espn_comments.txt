Ccrump08::Why is Lin being compared to Tebow?? Lin has stats and dominates. Lin also was un-drafted and went to Harvard. He is the definition of a smart, hard working person. Tebow preaches like he is Jesus, and all Lin does is thank god. Lin is much better at basketball than Tebow will EVER be at football.

tigerDB12MA::Young Jeezy
elibeme::This is so annoying. finally the nfl ends and i figured ok good tebow mania is over. Ya ok Lin is better. I dont care if he is better then Jesus Christ, I don't want 70% of every sports center to be about 1 man. I dont want espn to have the same man on their headline every day. espn is lazy and annoying. Talk about everyone. IDC how good he is or isnt...
elibeme::I wish i could go on sportscenter for a day see if i can get em to talk about sprts
clausewitzofsuburbia::either Lin moving off the couch, to Lebron's favorite pizza toppings, to Favre's new jeans commercial.  You get a choice of meaningless fluff.
inglehacker::24, 22, 24, 24, 29, 20, 16, 26, 31, 26, 21    Those are Flip Murray's scoring numbers in his first 11 starts. He was a 2nd round draft pick from a DII college who barely played his rookie season. When Ray Allen went down he got the surprise start and exploded, leading the Sonics to a 7-4 start. Then teams figured him out, he got demoted back to the bench, and faded to a 12.4 ppg average. He never managed to match that again the rest of his career and never became an NBA starter.
stnew200::And Lin will become more of a point guard and less of a scorer as well. But they will win if Melo cooperates or gets traded.
dont_float::He didn't lead his team to 6-0 and for the most part without their 2 biggest stars.
inglehacker::He did lead them to 7-4, and it was without Ray Allen, their biggest star.  Since the Knicks have played 5 teams that will miss the playoffs and 1 that will barely make it, this 6-0 start is getting a little more hype than it deserves.  The Nets, Wizards, and Raptors are just horrible teams, Utah is free-falling (lost 7 of last 9 games), Minny is mediocre (lost 4 straight and last in their division), and the Lakers are horrible on the road.  Even with an average point guard, the knicks would have been favored in 4 or 5 of those games.
inglehacker::And I've always rooted for Lin, at least since his Harvard days - but let's be realistic about how small his NBA sample size is.
