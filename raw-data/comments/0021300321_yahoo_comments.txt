Devil's Advocate::Hey Bucks, did you learn anything?  19 points by your starting 5?!  Are you kidding me?  Gotta love it when the San Antonio starting five doesn't even play half the game and STILL blows out the Bucks (except for 7 seconds by Duncan).
Moses::Let TD play more and he will have another 20-20 game... he now has 21-16...
Cyril::I really don't understand Larry Drew's motivations for playing veteran players so many minutes every game when this team is going nowhere. In the Bulls game last night, he let Antetokounmpo and Wolters rot on the bench while Mayo and Knight logged 40+ minutes.  WHY!?  To get a meaningless win in a season that is already an afterthought?  Antetokounmpo is supposed to be the future of this team, but the only way he can get PT is when they're losing by 25 or more.   If I were coaching the Bucks, I'd have a starting lineup of Henson, Ilyasova, Antetokounmpo, Mayo, and Knight.  The ONLY reason I'd have Mayo and Knight starting is because it's obvious that the front office wants them to play so they don't look stupid for making those moves. Middleton and Wolters would be getting the majority of the bench minutes since they both look like players worth developing, and I'd even get Raduljica in the game frequently.  Ridnour, Udoh, and Butler would rarely ever leave the bench.
Steve::Next year if the Bucks get Marcus Smart they will easily make the playoffs!
Tim::The Spurs are the best franchise in the NBA in the last 16 years. No one else comes close. Consistency, teamwork, unselfish play are the trademarks of the Popovich/ Dncan era.
Harsh Y. Ronvelia::Put the damn starting lineup in, Milwaukee, so those idiots can own up to the embarrassment they dug themselves into. Garbage.
Travis::They need to trade Ersan. Talk about the most underutilized player in the NBA.
CSONKA_39::Milwaukee should join the "D" League.
Ludema::GO SPURS!!! WE GOT THIS ONE!!!
K::wolters can play. time to bench knight
