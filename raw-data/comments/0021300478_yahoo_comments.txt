AZ Jim::What is going on with Bledsoe?? In his last 7 games played he has averaged less than 15 ppt. Is he really hurt or what? He has lost his explosiveness and does not seem to want to drive to the basket as he did in the first part of the season..As for last nights game, the Suns were atrocious at the free throw line, and Dragic was the only Sun's player on the court who played with heart...Time for the rest of the team to step up and play a little harder than we saw last night..
David::Prince needs to come off the bench with fewer minutes.  I know he is a little better than average on defense, but he is not contributing with the minutes given him.
gary::The reserves forgot to show up for the game tonight. Also, poor defense and lack of rebounding was a contributing factor. Go Suns!
old guy::Morris twins looked like they didn't know there was a game going on tonight. They were just terrible.
Matthew::PJ Tucker is just awful offensively -- he's nice defensive stopper, but he's also a liability playing 30+ minutes a night.  He should be getting around 18-20 minutes of run per game.
Barry::might have been the worst quarter for the Suns all year.
Ronnie M::Here we go again dragic taking a ton of shots instead of passing the ball this moron has no clue how to run this team. This guy is going to be the down fall to this team.
fernando::what happend to bledsoe?...good win for the visitors, it was a night of upsets!
George::What happened to Eric Bledso?
slim::what
