achan::Seems like what the Wolves need are another scorer off the bench, and a defensive reinforcement in the paint. They have that in Muhammad and Dieng, either of them would be better than Mbah a Moute. Adelman needs to utilize all the talents he has on his bench!
RC::kevin love is kind of like carmelo with more of a perimeter oriented game...love will easily outscore his man most nights & the whole starting lineup produces, but until the wolves get better on defense, they will be mediocre. for all of love's scoring, if u can't stop enough easy layups and close, high percentage shots in the paint, you might wind up giving up too many points. just about every player on the spurs shot at least 50%...ridiculous even for the spurs..
Joe::I think the Timberwolves need a backup point guard more than anything.  It seems like every time JJ enters the game, they look like the worst team in the nba.  No one plays well with him, he can't guard anyone, the nba doesn't let him get away with flopping every game anymore, and he doesn't shoot the ball well and never has.  I really hope they find something better by the trade deadline.
brian::Well, this game actually had a tip-off...that's good.
Long Duck Dong::Love is 8-9 from 3pt range yet didnt take 1 shot in the last 5 minutes of this game.  what the.....
rodrigo p::the 4 quarter was the Manu show!!! he is still  amazing
Dixon Cider::Love is a beast. It's too bad the team around him sucks
Arizona Jones::Ginobli +27 in 25 mins on the floor.  That is making an impact.  Kevin Love needs some help.
Ronny::It's sad but K. Love has ABSOLUTELY NO HELP
MAATMAN::Parker 29 pts ,, rubio 13,, wolves lose by 7,, ,get rid of rubio he sucks
