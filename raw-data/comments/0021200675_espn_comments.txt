nba is the worst::"Well, I didn't say it didn't prove anything. Those were not my exact words," Evans said during an interview on SiriusXM radio's "Off the Dribble" show. "I just said they won a championship in a lockout season. That's what I said. So I never downplayed it or nothing, I just said they won a championship. That was really about it. I guess people just took it out of proportion."  Evans later said: "One thing about me is like when I'm gonna talk about you, I'm pretty much gonna say it in your face. I'm not gonna go in the media and say it to the media. It was kind of hilarious to me because I think it was blown out of proportion because that's not my DNA. I don't throw jabs through Twitter or social media. I don't do that type of work. It's cool. I'm not dwelling over it. I just think it was taken way out of proportion and stuff like that."
cbbaseball19::He mad..........
nba is the worst::Remarkable how dumb he is...
cbbaseball19::Everyone quiet down, its too loud in here!
RunTheBall22_-_::this is actually one of cbb's smarter posts

cbbaseball19::I played basketball with him yesterday, he goes "Did you read all the stuff about it?" I told him I did, he goes "Talk about bursting someones bubble!" lol
brandonlee561heat22::Yea, thats probably a touchy subject
cbbaseball19::Yeah me neither.  Im hanging out at his cousins house today, we dont talk about it though
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Greg Oden would be a nice addition.
RunTheBall22_-_::to a gutter cleaning company
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::We're not looking for a star, just someone who can help us rebound.
RunTheBall22_-_::so why would he be a good addition if he can't stay on the court. see the sixers and Bynum. hows that working out
cbbaseball19::no he doesnt talk a lot of ball......
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::You really don't know much about basketball do you? He's a decent Center, just can't stay healthy.
brandonlee561heat22::"Now that Joel Anthony isn't playing regularly, James Jones has decided to sign him to a 10-day contract for the pregame 3-on-3 games"  lol
marc_vader::Need to give him a try regardless.
brandonlee561heat22::He's just horrific offensively, still
cbbaseball19::He eats popcorn before game.  That man couldnt hang on to the ball if his life depended on it.
brandonlee561heat22::Ethan Skolnick twitter
cbbaseball19::Oh got ya.  Thats pretty funny.  I probably wouldnt even sign him to my 3 on 3 team
cbbaseball19::Whered you see that?!
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::i hope miami comes to play tomorrow so all those hick fans in indiana can ease up with all their 'challenging the heat' aspirations.
Aicyla22::idk its fun to give ppl hope then crush it on a bigger stage, no?
Aicyla22::perhaps
Derrick Rose owes LeBron an MVP::youre evil just like every other girl out there.

cbbaseball19::RunTheBall22_-_ Ignore yeah but now no kids are allowed behind the heat bench because of the Birdman --------- more basketball talk from run........
RunTheBall22_-_::says the guy who has been posting lame jokes all day. derp
cbbaseball19::.............
RunTheBall22_-_::it's basketball related and is not a lie. I haven't told a lie in 13 years. everything i say is solid fact or  has been researched to the fullest extent. or sometimes just made up but usually the first two
Aicyla22::cb its not going anywhere
cbbaseball19::You still arent talking about basketball though.  You are talking about him having to stay away from kids which is a lie and is not actually about basketball at all
RunTheBall22_-_::Birdman is a player on a basketball team.
cbbaseball19::Says the man who says he only talks ball..........
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::How do you get an account unbanned? I have one from 2001, but they banned it last year, I kind of want it back now to look badass.
Aicyla22::write an email
Aicyla22::ohhh that sucks sorry
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Got a message back saying my account has been suspended too many times :(. Oh well, thanks for helping.

What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Okay, thanks.
Aicyla22::i dont think so just tell him the username i think
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::Do I need the email I used to sign up with it?
Aicyla22::sbrock@m z i n g a .com  with no spaces
Rambomonster9::I dont care what anyone says, Birdman is a HUGE addition.  Him alone in 10 minutes had more offensive rebounds than Bosh and Haslem combined have for an entire game!! SWOOP
RunTheBall22_-_::yeah but now no kids are allowed behind the heat bench because of the Birdman
Aicyla22::by a while back he means everyday
RunTheBall22_-_::it's me they are talking about, i was ripping on the birdman pretty hard a while back.
Rambomonster9::RunTheBall ???  u serious?  i dont remember posting this.  i must be crazy
RunTheBall22_-_::yeah rambo stop re posting
cbbaseball19::My point exactly.
Aicyla22::youve said that sooooo many times
Rambomonster9::that is true but in the long run thats good for the team too.  Those kids annoy james/wade too much anyway
GaspoMinnyFan981::CAWWWW CAWWWW!
Grumkin04::Reggie Evans sure backed up all his talk last night!! Good for him!!
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::His 0 points in 20 minutes was impressive.
Grumkin04::Average for him.
RunTheBall22_-_::hey look at the two girls and their puppy pics, isn't that cute
koke003::Butt hurt
What Did I do 15 is back just like The U::You must have a dull life.
