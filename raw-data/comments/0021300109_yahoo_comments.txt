Cyril::Barring any major injuries, David Lee is on pace to finish this season with 10,000 career points, 6,000 career rebounds, and 1,500 career assists. For all the people who criticize him, that's simply a great career for a guy who was a 30th pick.  If he plays another four years, he should have close to 15,000 points and more than 9,000 rebounds.
Win or Lose with Honor::Gotta laugh! Why the Pistons would sign Josh Smith and Chauncey Billups and then trafe for Brandon Jennings makes no sense. They already have a Jennings in Bynum and they were fine on their front line. They needed shooters and a real point guard. Should have resigned Calderon and looked for a small forward who cold stretch the D. Once again the Pistons are loaded with a bunch of overrated guards; Stuckey, Billups (too old), Bynum, Jennings, Maybe Pope will be a keeper? Cheez Joe, stop spending dough on free agents, you have been terrible in that aspect. Shuold have kept Afflalo and Amir Johnson. Now we have four ball hogs in Stuckey, Bynum, Jennings and Smith! What gives with common sense. Even Cheeks the coach looks clueless.
kodo::Detroit's second unit doing way better than starters...or Warriors just slacking off in the 4th.
p_::good win for the dubs… but their bench needs work; particularly harrison barnes, who just seems uninspired & disinterested in his role as a non-starter
John::Looks like another loss for the Weasels!
fup duck::Warrior should win by 80
PKM::Warriors home game equals SPLASH
C::nooo why you take drummond out!
JM::are you kidding me? 19-point lead?
dan::All 4 losing teams today scored 95 points and all winners score more than 100 points.  what a coincidence.  something ominous going to happen?
