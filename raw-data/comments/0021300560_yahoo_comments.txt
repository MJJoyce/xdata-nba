Gary M::Mavs are underrated and i think 2nd half of season will show this to be true.
SJA::Orlando sucks. They are not going anywhere with that dumb coach!!!
Ngoo Nam::With Shawn not available, Vince and Jae must provide that cushion and just run away with the game, providing Dirk, Monta, Jose and the rest do their part.
PKM::The Magic are really bad.
Amir::Dallas looks nice with this season back-court, they will be team you don't want to play against in playoffs.
Chris::where the #$%$ is Nicholson
Loosie::dallas should be 20-18 without the help of the refs...
PhilosopherJay::What is bad is not that the Magic are losing, nobody expected them to win a lot of games, but the amount they're losing by. In the last eight games, they have lost by 13, 6 (in overtime), 16, 20, 16, 20, 26, and 19. Only in the overtime lose to Cleveland were they even competitive. Boston has lost nine in a row, but they were competitive in five of them and only lost four by more than 10 points. If a team has a long losing streak but are competitive in half the games, you say, "Okay, a little tweaking here and there and we would have won half those games", but when a team gets repeatedly blown out, you really need to start making big changes.
Beachwalker::These are two of the teams I follow.  Orlando is into year 2 of a 3 year plan to turn around the franchise.  The Magic don't seen to be playing any better than last year.  That's makes me wonder if they are tanking the season trying to be in position to get the # 1 pick next year.  I guess it's also possible they are playing showcasing veterans hoping to get some young players when the trading deadline nears.  The Mavs will make the playoffs, but the Mavs need some more help thru trades go get very deep into the playoffs.  We are not an elite team right now.
Anton::game over...
