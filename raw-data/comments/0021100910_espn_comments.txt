THUNDAboi77::Hey Portland Fans,  Have fun watching the playoffs from home  sincerly  -OKC fans.. ps.Thunder up!!
eazyt_971::SEATTLE SUPERSONICS
Rdhutchi::Best dunk montage I've seen in a while Check this out if you love dunks!!!!!!!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDc-di5kIek
tells...it...like...it...is::Steve Nash should be in the MVP conversation. No way Phoenix should have a winning record, much less make the playoffs.
SportsFANaticPC::God i hope steve nash makes the playoffs... i dont care about the suns lol... they are losing their credibility as a competitive team each year with their transactions... they need to find a decent 2 guard, and a decent 4, keep gortat who will be your defensive presence with an above par offensive ability.  steve has 2 years left as an offensive PG, but defensively... eh... they might need to go zone with his old legs lol...
musingmike::Phoenix is so close, but they'll miss the playoffs because of the rest of the 5 games on the schedule compared to Houston.
oczonie::Houston has to play Dallas and Miami still.  Mavs have suffered two OT losses in a row, they will avenge themselves at home against the Rockets.  Granted the Suns have the toughest teams to beat, but all of them are home games (except Salt Lake).  OKC and Clips are back to back, so that will be an issue, but the Clips will also be on a back to back.  If anything, Utah has the best chance of snagging the last spot, but anything can happen.  Suns need to prove themselves worthy of making it this far in this shortened season.  They are capable of doing it, just need to execute.
Eric62748::Go Jazz! nobody is talking about them! They have an easy remaining schedule! I think they sneak in the playoffs!
eazyt_971::I agree. But don't they lose their first round pick if they make the playoffs? And if so is it worth losing  their pick to get blasted in the first round by either OKC or S.A?
kobescored30butshot12for40::I found a betting system a few months back called Sportsbettingstar. I have made over 3K a month for 2 months straight now following this system. I found  this system by googling the words "sports betting system" It was on the 1st page of Google when I found it.Thought I would post this for anyone that is looking for a system that actually works
Arizona_Sting::Suns babyyy!!!!
kobe fan8::cmon suns! make it to the playoffs and knock off the thunder!!
phxstar20::I would love the match up against the spurs in the 1st round regardless of the game the other day. Suns can burn them in a series
freaky69az::Spurs now tied for #1 seed
basketballdiaries::I don't know how the Suns are going to do it, they've got a very tough schedule to finish off the season. But if they make the playoffs, it'll be incredible!
Kobelies247::Blazers = BIGGEST JOKE IN NBA HISTORY!!!!
eazyt_971::Kobelies247= another suns fan who still has nightmares about Terry Porter
AZ D-Backs all day::word
CuddlesDaKat::Kobelies!  It's your butt buddy!  meow!!!
123cooldog::gj suns! go nash, go suns!
freaky69az::Spurs tied with OKC for #1 seed.  I knew it.
freaky69az::I thought for sure picking the Clippers as my SFTC pick would GUARANTEE the Thunder would win, and even THAT didn't work.
ValleyDesperado::Did the suns win?
ValleyDesperado::^^ G-a-y boy
CuddlesDaKat::YOU WANNA MEET UP AT ONE OF THE PORN THEATERS ON MCDOWELL???  HAWT!  MEOW!!!
CuddlesDaKat::THE SUNS WON...BUT THE COYOTES LOSE TOMORROW.  SMITH WILL BE LUCKY IF HE ESCAPES WITH HIS LIFE.  MEOW!!!
AZ D-Backs all day::my bad
ValleyDesperado::Dude, calm down im jk lol
AZ D-Backs all day::duh
123cooldog::gj suns! go nash, go suns!
freaky69az::Yes, because goalies in the NHL are chosen on the basis of their ability TO TAKE A HIT!!!
ValleyDesperado::How about you take a shoulder to the jaw...pus-sy!
CuddlesDaKat::HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!
CuddlesDaKat::I CAN TELL YOU THAT MOST BLACKHAWK FANS HOPE THAT MIKE SMITH GETS A BLADE ACROSS HIS JUGULAR AND BLEEDS OUT TOMORROW.  I DON'T CONDONE SUCH VIOLENCE...BUT, THEN, I'M NOT A CHICAGOAN.  AND CHICAGOANS DON'T LIKE FLOPPERS AND PUS.SIES LIKE MIKE SMITH.  THEY WILL MAKE HIM CRUMBLE.  MEOW!!!
TubbyTime334::If Suns keep Nash and actually make some Moves, Next Year could be Interesting.
ValleyDesperado::He wants to retire a sun
AZ D-Backs all day::I truly think Nash will sign with the Suns.
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::Remember: Sports junkies rule and news hounds suck.
AZ D-Backs all day::dont know what that means but ... Yeah!
TubbyTime334::Remember: He says this after every Game
BaseballJack66::Guys dont forget, we SWEPT San Antonio just two years ago!  I think we can at least give them a run for their money with our roster, just gotta hope they fall cold a couple games and we get hot
freaky69az::That was WONDERFUL.  But that was then, and this is now.
AZ D-Backs all day::the Suns have the best chance to sign Nash this summer. with all the cap space we have they will improve the roster. Nash wants to retire in Phoenix because his kids go to school here and he loves the Suns. we drafted Nash back when he was a youngin ya know
CuddlesDaKat::YOUR OWNER IS BROKE.  OUR OWNER IS A BILLIONAIRE.  MEOW!!!
CuddlesDaKat::HISSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
freaky69az::crawl back in the closet, pu<b>ssy boy!</b>
CuddlesDaKat::WHY NASH IS COMING TO PORTLAND NEXT YEAR:  (1) CLOSE TO HOME -- VICTORIA, BC (2) OREGON IS PROGRESSIVE, ARIZONA IS ULTRACONSERVATIVE (3) WE DON'T SHOOT LIBERAL CONGRESSWOMEN HERE (4) THE LANDSCAPE INCLUDES GREEN (5) THERE IS TALENT IN PORTLAND...LOL GORTAT! (6) NO JOE ARPAIO (7) WE LIKE CANADIANS...HECK, WE'RE HALF CANADIAN OURSELVES! (8) WE LOVE OBAMA, JUST LIKE STEVE (9) HIS TEAMMATES WON'T IMPREGNATE HIS WIFE  MEOW!!!
eazyt_971::You can keep him. Go ahead and use up all your cap space to resign him. Portland has bigger plans for this summer.
eckonezz::If he goes to Portland next year, he might just as well retire now. . .every one goes down there. . .just like ROY &amp; ODEN if you get what im sayin
eazyt_971::LOL. Speak for yourself. I'm not half canadian.
BaseballJack66::I lol'd but forreal, I dont think politics and sheriffs an colors will sway him to go to a non playoff team haha
BaseballJack66::congrats bro
CuddlesDaKat::YEAH, WELL, WE ARE GETTING DWIGHT HOWARD TOO.  OUR OWNER IS A BILLIONAIRE.  YOUR OWNER IS BROKE!  MEOW!!!
CuddlesDaKat::YOU HAD ME AFTER TWO...  MEOW!!!
CuddlesDaKat::I USED TO LIVE IN THE SAME COMPLEX AS AMARE...HE ONCE SAID HI TO ME AND I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM!  MEOW!!!
CuddlesDaKat::I ACTUALLY ROOT FOR THE SUNS...BUT I WANT NASH AND PORTLAND IS A PURRRFECT FIT.  I RAGGED ON THE COYOTES BECAUSE MIKE SMITH IS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST P.USSY.  MEOW!!!
BaseballJack66::Betcha the dudes from Az and just a troll, he seems to know a lot about us and our political situation and our sheriffs name, etc...
freaky69az::Are you really a Blazers fan, or do you just root against Arizona teams?  You were in the NHL board the other night ragging on the Coyotes after the game 2 loss.
TubbyTime334::Lopez with some Nice Blocks, and how is Telfair playing out of his Mind Lately?
freaky69az::Spurs up by 24 end of 3rd.  Thunder and Clippers tied at end of 3rd.  SEE, it's happening ALREADY!!
AZ D-Backs all day::Telfair is playing really well. I hope we keep him next season. Same with Brown and Redd.
TubbyTime334::Man I Love The Suns!!! Go Playoffs!!!
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::YES!!!!!!!!!! SUNS WIN! TIED FOR 8TH! AND HAVE THE TIEBREAKER OVER THE ROCKETS!  Let's hope the Suns can get on a nice winning streak and the Rockets can lose a few. I admit OKC is a tough game,but you never know. I actually like our chances to beat the Clippers and Nuggets at home though I respect those teams. I just wish we didn't have the best team in the west coming in on Wednesday. But you never know,maybe we can win Wednesday if we bring our A game. I'm feeling REALLY good tonight and I'll sleep really well. Awesome win Phoenix Suns! Go Suns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
freaky69az::I just hope the OKC Thunder stay in that top spot, because if San Antonio takes it over . . . I don't want to think about it
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::The ONLY NBA team I HATE or even dislike is the Spurs but I REALLY HATE the Spurs.
freaky69az::I was thinking much more selfishly - the Suns getting ousted by the Thunder wouldn't bother me.  I have nothing against OKC.  But my hatred for the Spurs, their coach, their city, their fans, their players, and their team colors isn't good for my health.
AZ D-Backs all day::Spurs fans are inbred
RadioheadFanBryan::Agreed, Spurs would be a nightmare for the Suns.  They might at least make it interesting against OKC though.
freaky69az::Yes they do, and if the Suns get knocked out of the playoffs by the Spurs AGAIN, I might not be accountable for my actions . . .
cardinals-suns-diamondbacks-sun devils.::Spurs fans suck.
AZ D-Backs all day::word
screwhead2305::im glad the suns are doing well. if my Rockets dont make it then i would like the Suns to make it
freaky69az::Just looked it up: in the 4 games, it's Hou 2-Phx 2, but I could have sworn I heard on sports talk radio today that Suns hold the tiebreaker  maybe more important are the remaining schedules of the two teams Hou: @ Dal, @ NO, v GS, @ Mia, v NO Phx: v OKC, v LAC, v Den, @ Utah, v SA  ouch
Dynasty_Broncos::Summarized:  Now that we're battling Houston for the final spot, the Suns need 35 wins to match the Rockets in the end to make the playoffs.  If we were battling Denver, we might have only needed 34 wins to make the playoffs since the Nuggets will drop 3+ games left on their brutal schedule.
Dynasty_Broncos::Phoenix needs to win 35 total games in order to make the playoffs almost no matter what. If Houston ends up tied with 35 wins as well, then cool we make it. HOWEVER, the Rockets have 0 chance of finishing worse than 35 wins. They play New Orleans twice and Golden State once as well. They will not lose those games, so no matter what, the Suns HAVE to get a MAJOR upset over the Clippers, Thunder, or Spurs and at the same time not lose a game to Denver and Utah who are both playing well. If Denver had lost both games to Houston, they would have a chance of only winning 33 or 34 games for the year, meaning in some cases, PHX only has to go 2-3 over the next 5 games to make the playoffs. We could do that much easier! And even if Denver DID end up with 34 games won, so what?!? We would have had to win 35 anyway if we wanted to beat Houston out of the final spot.
Dynasty_Broncos::The above schedules remaining are the reason we wanted HOUSTON TO BEAT DENVER YOU MORONS!!!!! GAHHHHH!!! stop parading around like being tied for 8th with 5 games left means anything!!
freaky69az::If Houston had beaten Denver, the Rockets would be 1 game ahead the Suns with 5 games remaining for both teams.  Instead, they're tied, with Phoenix holding the tiebreaker.  I don't understand your logic, but I think it's wrong.
Los suns::We hold the tiebreaker because of better conference record.
screwhead2305::let me ask again.. what realistic plans do the Blazers have this offseason?
superflythemack::30 mil in cap space and 2 lottery picks give them some options.  what they do with this amount of flexibility will be interesting.
TheHedonismBot::Resign Batum and possibly Hickson.  Let Crawford and Felton walk.  Lure a high profile point guard (Deron Williams?)  Hire a new coach.  Fill remaining holes in free agency and the draft.
OSUMcCoy.348::SHAZAAM
Meet-The-Forkers::Lets go get OKC
AZ D-Backs all day::haha telfair passed to morris right as the shot clock went down so he wouldnt get the turnover! lol morris was pissed!
nbafan22222::Wow, very high scoring game.
eazyt_971::There is too much walking the ball up the court in todays NBA. I miss the 80's and early 90's where every team averaged over 100 PPG.
AZ D-Backs all day::run and gun suns. get used to it
CuddlesDaKat::BLAZERS 2012 LINEUP:  NASH MATTHEWS BATUM ALDRIDGE DWIGHT HOWARD  MEOW!!!
BaseballJack66::lol not happening
AZ D-Backs all day::dream on
freaky69az::Not YOU again!!!!!!!!!!
CuddlesDaKat::HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!
TheHedonismBot::What if we just get Greg Oden some mechanical legs?  Then we don't have to deal with Dwight drama.
CuddlesDaKat::I THINK WE WOULD ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS THE SPACE BETWEEN GREG'S EARS...PLUS WE KNOW AT LEAST ONE OF GREG'S LEGS IS HEALTHY (THE MIDDLE ONE).  MEOW!!!
eazyt_971::Don't want to use up all the cap room on a 40 yo PG.
CuddlesDaKat::YOU MEAN THE 38 YO PG THAT HAS MORE ASSISTS IN ONE QUARTER THAN ANY BLAZER PG HAS IN ONE GAME???  MEOW!!!
TheHedonismBot::Deron Williams on the other hand would be worth the cap room.
maynarddavid::#8 seed is moments away... hopefully Denver loses, and either they or the Rockets just tank so bad at the end that we only have to win 2 out of the rest of our games. We could easily go O-fer.
yorklinks2::it annoys me so much when ppl say lebrons not clutch and kobe is cuz well... thats wrong  kobe shoots .300fg% in the clutch, lebron has a .400fg%  if their stats in the clutch were throughout the whole game LEBRON is way better:  LeBron: 33.2ppg, 15.1rpg, 9.3apg, .386fg%  Kobe: 36.3ppg, 7.8rpg, 6.8apg, .327fg%  check out an article about that here, proof lebron is more clutch http://bustasports.com/?p=784
sports guy12::who holds the tie-breaker between Hou/Pho
Los suns::Phx with better conference record.  Season series is 2-2
Twuan89::PHX!
maynarddavid::PHX owns it.
freaky69az::I think Phx does
AZ D-Backs all day::get that sh*t outa here!
TheHedonismBot::Jazz Mavs going triple OT
eazyt_971::Would be a devastating loss for Utah.
nogicat6::crazy  GO MAVS
Los suns::No, go Jazz
screwhead2305::whats Portland plan in the offseason?
screwhead2305::ok seriously
eazyt_971::I was thinking Jerry Sloan but Phil would also be good.
TheHedonismBot::Sloan would be perfect.
TheHedonismBot::Sign Deron Williams. Trade for Dwight Howard and Lebron James.
TheHedonismBot::Oh, and hire Phil Jackson.
eazyt_971::depends on what happens in the playoffs.
YANKEES WIN THE WORLD SERIES THANKS KENTUCKY::I''ve seen better defense at the Rucker
TheHedonismBot::The refs won this game for the Suns.
TheHedonismBot::Of course I'm not serious
nogicat6::yeah up by 20  nice try
Danglehossa::Everything Phoenix shoots goes in.... its unbelievable
YANKEES WIN THE WORLD SERIES THANKS KENTUCKY::1st 3 minutes 8 points next 2 minutes 18 points. 4th qtr under 49 1/2 looking terrible now
Danglehossa::you would think that Porland would win putting up like 105
AZ D-Backs all day::babbit shoots too much sorry blazer fans
eazyt_971::dudes a gunner. Thats why we traded for him on draft day.
Nathan94713::Does anybody else find it curious that Markieff Morris is doing so much better than Marcus?
Nathan94713::Either way, I'm super happy at least one of them is doing well being a Jayhawk fan.
Nathan94713::Hmmm... I always chalked that up to the infamously inaccurate measuring performed by the nba.
Nathan94713::Is he actually bigger than Marcus? They're twins.
BaseballJack66::yes hes an inch taller and a little thicker
BaseballJack66::No, because he has the size and hes been branded a better all around player, Marcus' game fit college perfectly but not NBA style.  Markeiff is the opposite
Nathan94713::One spot higher, and inexplicably.
Nathan94713::Apparently...
AZ D-Backs all day::obviously its not inexplicable anymore
AZ D-Backs all day::no. he was drafted higher
eazyt_971::Does anybody know about this Noah Croom guy. He's rumored to be the leading candidate for the blazers GM job. I heard he once worked in the spurs organization but thats about all I know about him.
YANKEES WIN THE WORLD SERIES THANKS KENTUCKY::can anybody get a stop
Arizona_Sting::Well, Im heading back to the Dbacks board, finish the game Suns!
