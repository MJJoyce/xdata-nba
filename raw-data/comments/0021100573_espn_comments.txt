doggto::so pumped for nash to win it all in toronto next year http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
ZachC1965::They should just give LBJ the MVP award right now...
mrhandy25::Sure, why not, they gave the Heat the title before the season was over!
THA TRUTH 365::HEY, THEY DID IT WITH D ROSE LAST YEAR. 1ST MONTH THEY ORDAINED HIM THE MVP, END OF THE SEASON HE DIDN'T DESERVE IT, BUT GOT IT ANYONE.  FUNNY HOW THE PERSON WHO WON IT GOT OUTPLAYED BY THE PERSON WHO SHOULD HAVE WON IT.
C2Poke88::True dat!!!
Minnesota.Legends::"Josh Smith has told the Hawks he wants to be traded ahead of the March 15 deadline, sources tell the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Source: Atlanta Journal-Constitution Mar 8 - 3:00 PM"
Robert156877::Big deal.  He has another year on his contract, so it's not likely that he will be traded this year.
GBM04::Still crying??
Cardinals542::I think it is dumb that everyone bashes on the lebron. If rings were everything, I would not be a penguins, flyers, jazz, reds, utes, and arizona cardinals fan. I would be a lakers, celtics, st. louis cardinals, yankees, red wings, canadiens, maple leafs, kentucky wildcats, steelers, cowboys, and niners fan if rings were everything.
E. Jack Culate::but i am impressed you can name so many sports teams
E. Jack Culate::your sports knowledge is lacking
E. Jack Culate::and i am pretty sure the flyers won a stanley cup or two
E. Jack Culate::and the reds won the 90 world series
Anthony3272::Big Red Machine!!!!!
E. Jack Culate::penguins won 3 stanley cups that i can remember
Los P.E.P.E.S::These so called experts are a complete joke lmfao.. Read on Heat fans: http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/LeBron-James-Dwyane-Wade-Chris-Bosh-Miami-Heat-are-no-match-for-Derrick-Rose-Chicago-Bulls-051211 This Jason Whitlock guy is a joke and should sit in a corner somewhere..
Skynet33::Whitlock is an idiot.
Anthony3272::He reminds me of Skip Gayless
THA TRUTH 365::SKIP SAYLESS OR SKIP PAYLESS.
E. Jack Culate::calling him skip gayless would be calling him not gay.  so if your intent was to diss him, maybe call him skip baseless (that's what stephen A calls him) or skip Gayest
Los P.E.P.E.S::I actually think Skip makes some good intelligent arguments at times just not about Bron, but this Whitlock dude talks out of his behind..
GBM04::Still crying??
Dem_Canes_Man::Man, the Bulls team reminds me a lot of Philly's team with AI when they played the Lakers in the Finals.
Anthony3272::and lost!
RicoSuave925::Kobe has more rings than the whole Miami Heat combine. LosHeatSonLosMejores6 go do your homework son....I'm out
E. Jack Culate::and Brian Cardinal has more rings than Charles Barkley, john stockton, karl malone, patrick ewing, lebron james, steve nash combined
pgp.carter::Your momma is my son to
redsoxfan4ever2009::Too, Not to. Get back in class.
pgp.carter::Kobe just lost two games in a row to bums g
redsoxfan4ever2009::It's TWO games in a row, Son. Grammar 101.
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::Says The Limp Mamba^^^^^^
redsoxfan4ever2009::Maybe if Lebron kept his talent in his home state, Instead of making it a mockery on live TV, Saying that load of BS.........  He wouldn't be the most hated guy in Pro Sports.
Anthony3272::and who the hell wants to live in Boston!
Anthony3272::He was their for seven years, what did you want him  to do, have you seen his home here in south Fla on the water!!!!!!!!
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::Why would you want to live in Ohio vs Florida????
E. Jack Culate::Well if you play for Cleveland, then  you have to live in Cleveland during the NBA season during home games.
redsoxfan4ever2009::It's you that said...."Live in Ohio vs Florida"
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::You  make no sense
redsoxfan4ever2009::Has NOTHING to do w/ your address. He could live anywhere. Hell....Even Peyton lives in S. FL. But that didn't keep him from jumping ship on his team.
pgp.carter::D.rose hit a nice buzzer beater against the bucks
E. Jack Culate::and the vegas bookies.
E. Jack Culate::and the bulls fans, and the bucks fans
E. Jack Culate::and the bulls
pgp.carter::The bucks
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::who cares?
no-one-cares-about-boise-st.::Miami also shoots +6.027 % higher than their opponents........  Its not like the Heat need Free Throws to win the games.... The Heat are a better shooting team than everyone else.
no-one-cares-about-boise-st.::Also the Heat are the 4th best rebounding team in the NBA at + 2.8 per game.  Also the Heat take 15 3's per game which is in the bottom 5 of the NBA.  Combine these stats and of course the Heat attacking the rim should be much higher in free throw attempts.
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::RicoSuave925.........best part of him ran down mommy's leg when I was done with her
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::RicoSuave925............45 years old and still @ home with mommy
RicoSuave925::you mad bro?  Internet "tough" guy lmao
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::Go slurp on kobe's mamba, No one want's you here. I warned your mom not to roll onto the wet spot. You think she listened??? Damn Puerto Rican trash.................
nesta37::That's what happens when someone can't think of anything else
RicoSuave925::lol...Why you copying me? Son go do your homework...
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::You mad bro?
RicoSuave925::hahaha.. you must be under 18...Your mommy is calling you to go do your homework..
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::You mad bro? True life loser^^^^^^^^
no-one-cares-about-boise-st.::Also heat haters........ the heat shoot 2.2 more free throws per game than their opponent.  The Lakers shoot 3.5  Thunder 4.9  Denver 7.7 leads the league.  Heat don't get all the calls clowns.
Skynet33::That's an excellent piece of data.
no-one-cares-about-boise-st.::The kings average 2.2 more free throw attempts more per game than their opponents.  Do the Kings boards blow up with ref conspiracy's?
no-one-cares-about-boise-st.::It like people just make up their own stats.
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::Why did Wade have the ball at the end of the game?? Hinrich was playing defense on him, another great strategic play but Spo. James haters can EatAHeatDy.ck!!!
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::Wade had the ball, which means it's guaranteed he'll get cheap fouls with easy FT's....DUH!
RicoSuave925::Cause he doesn't want Lebron to choke again..Lebron is not a closer..
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::You mad bro?
RicoSuave925::you must be like 13?
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::Truth hurts?
RicoSuave925::Internet" tough" guy..
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::You choke on my Co.ck
RicoSuave925::hahaha liking your own comment.?..The truth hurt huh? I don't blame you...
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::Ricosuave??? You must never get laid
redsoxfan4ever2009::What will be the excuse this yr if/ when Lebron doesn't win it all this yr. ?
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::Kobe had help = 5 rings.  Rose has only been in the league 2 years now....team is still young and improving. Already has a good defense behind him, with good rebounders.
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::my point is, they don't complain about not having help. Kobe did in 2008, and got the help he wanted to get to the finals and win 2 'ships.
RicoSuave925::Every player that won a ring had help..
no-one-cares-about-boise-st.::I don't think Lebron makes any excuses for himself.  I think a Sox fan should respect a man trying to get over the hump.
redsoxfan4ever2009::How's that ?
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::"he doesn't have enough help"
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::All Bulls fans claim Rose has no help. Noah was the 9th overall selection in draft and Dung was 7th overall player in his draft. Boozer somehow has been an allstar as well.
RicoSuave925::When have Rose and Kobe fans said that? You just making stuff up...
no-one-cares-about-boise-st.::Thats what Rose fans say?  Thats what Kobe fans say?  I am confused by this logic......... also throw Howard in that mix as well.
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::Im out guys. bout to enjoy this nice weather. Stay up haters!
pgp.carter::He likes what he said
RicoSuave925::So Lebron's fans what are the excuses gonna be when LeChoke don't win a ring this year? He didn't have an All Star Center and PG?..He didn't have a good coach? He didn't have Kobe? which one is it?
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::not a Heat fan or LeBron fan....but if LeBron finally wins his ring this year, all I'm gonna say is "Damn...bout time!"
seemoney15::why would he need kobe he doesnt lead teams to championships he rides ppl all the way there
RicoSuave925::Don't be ignorant..they were role players.. Kobe is a batman and  was a robin...
seemoney15::so does robert horry and luke walton but were not askin for advice from them
RicoSuave925::Cause Kobe knows how to be a Champion...
Miami Heat Fins Marlins Canes::What's going to be your reason for hating on him after he wins a ring this year?
RicoSuave925::I'm not a hater i think he's a great basketball player but overrated..
42Wolverine21::he gon win this year lil boy
RicoSuave925::nah he's not gonna get 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 hahaha
42Wolverine21::whether bron wins three o four titles it don matter but u bout to get busted upside ur chin
RicoSuave925::that's all you can say lil boy? lol the truth hurt huh? lol
42Wolverine21::go bak to puerto rico lil boy
RicoSuave925::I heard that since 2003
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::Saying someone wont win is one thing. But saying you DONT want someone to win just because, means your a hater.
seemoney15::i thought u were a lebron fan?
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::I am
conlevis2::it wouldn't be a Heat game without the Heat takin 3x as many free throws as their opponent.
42Wolverine21::chillin like a lama in my lade all day everyday go heat
pgp.carter::Kobe 2 game L streak to bums
seemoney15::im happy about it. i mean 9-31 cmon thats pathetic
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::Im sure the haters like yourself are happy bout that
RicoSuave925::Lebron could have Wade Bosh Howard Melo Rondo Love Chris Paul and still will find a way to choke...
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::he would still need more help
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::<b>Im glad nobody thinks the Clippers will contend. worst half court offense in the league. have they evn heard of ball movement?</b>
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::But Mo wouldnt help Boston
seemoney15::he aint leavin boston
Dem_Canes_Man::Paul Pierce would help them.
RicoSuave925::Kobe+Montana=rings Lebron+Marino= great regular season stats
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::yawn...............
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::yawn.......................
RicoSuave925::You don't wanna hear the truth? I don't blame you
Miami Heat Fins Marlins Canes::<strong>Hello</strong>
seemoney15::way to let the mods in on the secret lol
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::&lt; m &gt;       take out the spaces
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::holy shit    fucking awesome!
Miami Heat Fins Marlins Canes::Ok, I can't do that.
Miami Heat Fins Marlins Canes::Yes! I guess those HTML classes in high school did pay off.
seemoney15::This just in: Lebron is awesome and will win MVP (again). He is perfect too.
redsoxfan4ever2009::Come on, You must have a better reason than that. There's ignorant fans everywhere.
seemoney15::who knows. ignorant fans in my opinion
redsoxfan4ever2009::Why is Lebron the most hated guy in the NBA ?
seemoney15::i disagree whenever someone talks abot jordan they mention MVP's. you cant help what team ur on. malone/stocton/barkley/etc. never won rings but we know they are top all time
redsoxfan4ever2009::Fans don't remember how many MVP's one wins. It's all about the bling ring.
seemoney15::that may be the stupidest thing i have ever heard in my entire life
seemoney15::that was a joke. everyone knows that rings dont determine how skilled a player is
redsoxfan4ever2009::What's that....."He is perfect too" ?
redsoxfan4ever2009::MVP's don't mean jack &amp;^%$. Winning rings is all that matters.
RicoSuave925::I want Lebron to win the MVP award cause every time he win, Kobe win the FINALS MVP..
Dem_Canes_Man::Kobe is a black hole...he has never seen a shot that he didn't like!  6'7" Monta Ellis sometimes.
dramend::Kobe couldn't beat the Wiz.
RicoSuave925::Kobe knows how to be a Champion unlike  LeChoke he doesn't know how to win a ring
pgp.carter::only title Kobe winning is scoreing champ
redsoxfan4ever2009::LeBron James &gt; Dan Marino.  Regular season all flash, Playoffs, Loser.
dramend::This just in: Lebron is awesome and will win MVP (again).  He is not perfect, however.
Miami Heat Fins Marlins Canes::@JB_Smoove, better watch out, because when my Dolphins get Peyton Manning we're coming up there to destroy Tom Brady and that weak defensive team they call the Patroits.
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::Patriots will be back in he SB. they will draft either a defensive playmaker(CB, DE) and pick up a another WR threat
seemoney15::comin to Minnesota!!
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::#18 would look sweet!!!
lebron is bald::i say the cardinals get him.... they got the dome
Dem_Canes_Man::Super-Manning to the Texans would be sick!  The 49ers would be serious too!
Dem_Canes_Man::Pats can't defend. The Ravens would have beaten NY in the SB.
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::<b>Lebron doesnt eat his wheaties, therefore he'll never be great.</b>
seemoney15::bad move if they do
Dem_Canes_Man::hey man....Paul Pierce to the Clippers?
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::negative. we need a big man, not a streaky shooter
Dem_Canes_Man::mo Williams, and draft pick, and cash.
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::for who?
GBM04::Keep crying
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::gay
Dem_Canes_Man::?
Dem_Canes_Man::?
Dem_Canes_Man::got you.
GBM04::thats for the haters
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::20 more minutes til I'm off this S H I T!!! Thursday is the new friday
Miami Heat Fins Marlins Canes::In Boston.
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::anybody that doesnt work on friday lol
IsaacFinest::Just watched the game on my DVR, I haven't seen a more bias officiated game since Sacramento lost to the Lakers like 10 years ago. I can't stand how games become decided by the officials and not the players. I mean come on, no free throws in the first half? None at all? And Zaza falls on the ground, LeBron dives on top of him. No foul? I entirely agree it's a tech on Zaza for what he did after the play, but there should have been double tech's handed out there, not just on Zaza. Also at one point Jeff Teague got DECKED trying to shoot.... no foul... easy fast break 2 points for the Heat. I'm not accusing the Heat of cheating, I'm accusing the refs of being bias. Don't be confused with that. Refs $@%! me off.
Cardinals542::saw the heat-lakers game on sunday? Terrible refs in that game, calling nothing on lakers except a tech.
C2Poke88::@ IsaacFinest - If that's really what you saw, then you're as blind as a bat.
IsaacFinest::@seemoney15, re-watch the game and focus on the calls and its surroundings. you'll be surprised about this one.
IsaacFinest::nice try spelling my name.
seemoney15::you dont hand out a tech fo what bron did.  all you haters complain about refs EVERY single game
Dem_Canes_Man::nice try Issac!
GBM04::lol
RicoSuave925::For Dolphins fans in here,  You can already count Miami out. Peyton does not want to be overshadowed by Lebron's 8 championships
pgp.carter::Wah Wah waaah
lebron is bald::kc can
Miami Heat Fins Marlins Canes::Peyton's coming here, besides KC none of the other teams can offer the young talent we have.
GBM04::keep crying
GBM04::Lebron is gonna be playing another 10 years, we can talk legacy then.
Miami Heat Fins Marlins Canes::I want it all this year! I want...  The Heat to win the title The Dolphins to sign Peyton Manning and win the AFC East The Marlins to contend for the World Series The Canes to be in the BCS conversation
SystematicLondonMiami::you forgot the panthers
lebron is bald::canes will be banned
Dem_Canes_Man::yeah...my Canes are in trouble!
redsoxfan4ever2009::LeBron doesn't have what it takes to be a Champion.
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::Thats because Lebron doesnt eat his wheaties.
3Miami::And that's an ugly kitty you have there sir!! Who the f**k has their pet cat as a profile pic??
redsoxfan4ever2009::What are you, 10 yrs old ??
3Miami::Don't have one... But your girl can take my d**k off of her screen saver!
redsoxfan4ever2009::You can take down your LeBron fat head now.
Dem_Canes_Man::Interesting take Red Sox fan,.
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::both were sweeps.....no?
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::Luck...fluke...joke...choke...  Every excuse except for skill...right?  What's Miami's answer for the 2011 NBA Finals?
redsoxfan4ever2009::Luck my @$$.....
GBM04::luck
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::2004 &amp; 2007???
GBM04::fluke
Miami Heat Fins Marlins Canes::Red Sox- the real definition of choke.
itdoesntmatterwhoiis::then what was the 2011 NBA Finals.....from a Miami Heat fan's perspective? Luck too??? Or choke???
GBM04::When?
RicoSuave925::I saw the Heat highlight from last night game and Wade close the game...If it was Lebron's they would lose...How can you be the best player but choke when the game is on the line? smh
lebron is bald::no, he just stayed away so he couldnt choke
GBM04::31-11
GBM04::He choked last night??
RicoSuave925::He would of..if he had to take over.. but lucky for him batman had to do it for him..
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::Listen heat fans, you have a talented team. they have talent. But OKC is winning it all this year.   Thoughts?  .
C2Poke88::OKC isn't built for playoff success.  They are too perimeter oriented.  Their frontcourt players are all subpar offensive players.  Their bench is loaded with guys are hustle and scrap but are offensively limited.  And their D isn't very good.  IF they make through the WC in the playoffs, the Heat will beat them in 5 games.
Dem_Canes_Man::ummm....no. Sorry JB.
GBM04::Boston is too old now.
3Miami::Guess we gotta wait to find out buddy!!
Aicyla22::I'm going to lunch now ill be back JB so we can talk about how great Boston is and how young and fresh their legs are and how they'll for sure go all the way like you said over and over again yesterday
Aicyla22::Go Boston! Best team EVER!
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::Im still a boston fan, I've just accepted that OKC will win.
GBM04::lol
GBM04::Hasnt happened yet
C2Poke88::What will all the Lebron haters say if Lebron finishes this season with:  1. Highest PER season ever  2. MVP  3. DPOY  4. NBA title  5. Finals MVP    At this point 1-3 are a virtual lock. And 4 &amp; 5 are looking very attainable. That might be the greatest single-season ever.
pgp.carter::D.waDe finals mvp
C2Poke88::Nah.  He tried to do that last year and the TEAM lost.  In a way, I'm glad Wade's takeover failed in the Finals last year.  I can already see that he's a much more willing passer late in games.  When they make it to the Finals THIS YEAR, the Heat (especially Wade)  just need play to the principles and system that have made them successful.  If they do that, they will win the title and Lebron will be the Finals MVP.  If Wade tries to win Finals MVP, the Heat will lose their 2nd straight Finals and major changes will soon follow.
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::DPOY is going to Igoudala
C2Poke88::I seriously doubt that.  If D-12 doesn't win another one, Lebron will be the DPOY.  Iguodala will finish 3rd behind Lebron and D-12.
RicoSuave925::Nope...David Stern
RicoSuave925::"IF"  Lebron's fans been saying that since 2003...hahaha
C2Poke88::"IF" is a word used a lot by D-Rose, KD, and D-12 fans too.
GBM04::Howard fans too
GBM04::Theyll say Wade carried him.
redsoxfan4ever2009::Never happen.......
Dem_Canes_Man::Man....if the Heat win the chip this year....it's going to be hilarious.
Aicyla22::they better win this year or its going to be hilarious to everyone but us
Dem_Canes_Man::OKC doesn't defend!
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::KD is a great scorer and not much else. You do realize there is more to a basketball game like playing defence!!!!
GBM04::That would be a great Finals.
JB_Smoove_My_Sources::Dont worry, OKC is taking it all, including the MVP trophy that KD is gonna win.
Aicyla22::but when lebron promised to win 79 championships he put the heat in a bad situation   but yes losheat it will be very hard to beat the heat in a 7 game series, but not impossible.
LosHeatSonLosMejores6::Agreed,  Heat will be tough to beat in a 7 game series though. Everyone plays the Heat like it is game 7 of the Finals in regular season. That kind of intensity will be tough to sustain through 7 games
GBM04::Not really, theyll win one eventually.
GBM04::SWEEP THE LEG LOL
pgp.carter::A river :(
pgp.carter::How you like that D.waDe oop to haslem ?:)
GBM04::SWEET
GBM04::CRY CRY CRY
pgp.carter::A river
GBM04::Haters just keep crying.
