CosmoKramer1444::Dajaun Summers? Why was Aminu in the trade again?
minny snowta::the only one who can beat these wolves is liam neeson! ...maybe!
NdonkeykongSuh1::Last year Kevin Love was only added to the all star game due to injuries by another player. If Kevin Love somehow gets snubbed from the game this season  it will show that the basketball community cares more about dunks and flashiness then it does about actual talent
turnoverking the ref baby::actually shows the high iq of the average fan, because love is really good, but rubio gets to many gimmies
MikeBreenGetGreen::He will be there
mghiyasuddin::so true....
minny snowta::totally
nbadeacon::Big props to Kahn! He cleared the contract mess, stuck with Rubio and brought in Adelman.  He had a vision, dealt with the rocky road, didn't get fired and prevailed.  Since perfection is elusive, I can live with Jonny Flynn (now gone) and Darko.  Kahn has done his job better than at least half the GMs in the league, otherwise we would not be where we are.
mghiyasuddin::everybody hates on flynn... but coming out of college he looked like a great pick.... but then again... so did jamarcus russell and ryan leaf... sometimes u just cant expedict whats gonna happen when the players get paid
CosmoKramer1444::KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN should NEVER get props.
VANJON08::Pay Love Now!!!!!
NdonkeykongSuh1::I'll strongly agree with this statement when he locks Love and Rubio into long term contracts
nbadeacon::Adelman's a first-class coach.
Acousticlapguitar::I will be the first to admit i didn't think Rubio would be as good as he is. he is a fun player to watch.
Vikeslegit::Ricky in the starting lineup = winning
captaincasey336::but Kahn is in charge so I guess I can handle never making the playoffs
minny snowta::he had a good offseason.  pour you some kool-aid?
kenbomc::I heard Howard's thinking of coming here.  :-)
minny snowta::dont want him, dont need him.
NdonkeykongSuh1::thats just what we need. We have a good team of players. We don't need some whiny loudmouth. Howard wouldn't be able to deal with the fact that he would be the second best player on a team
31beef34::minny? oh i wish. instantly we'd have a playoff team..
captaincasey336::.
captaincasey336::Hopefully we can pick up a road win in Atlanta and move into a smoother schedule... I hope even more that Wolves decide to trade Wes Johnson and Beasley for someone... still on the fence about Randolph, Darko, and Ridnour. Also please stop playing Ellington  and that Barea and Lee are back soon
jack butler505::still on the fence about Darko, are you kidding? And we should hope Martell is back soon, hopefully he can start at the 2
moeakaspacecowboy::How does Kevin Love get tackled and they call a jump ball.
Plargo::I love that Rubio haters are getting their as*es handed to them.
amads138::the twolves comin' for your wife and children
thaggas::How are the TWolves 4-7?? Their roster is loaded.
jack butler505::haha if anyone shoots the ball consistently it's Beasley, so i dont know what your looking for
DaBearsDaBulls5423::We need to trade beasley and someone and get a 2 or 3 that can shoot the ball consistently.  If rubio can have a reliable option to pass to and make three's (like wayne ellington is starting to do) we would be untouchable.
KCMac929::They've been given a brutal schedule too because they were so bad last year, good teams got to play them early.  They actually should have beaten the Thunder and Heat but the refs just gave the games to those teams in the final minutes of those games.  One the wolves start getting respect and into the middle of the schedule I think they can actually compete for a playoff spot.
NBA_refs_are_weak::maybe in the east. but in the west I just dont see them winning more games than OKC, portland, denver, lakers, clippers, spurs, dallas and memphis. I guess memphis could slide, but with gay back, once z-bo returns they are gonna start stomping people. and im not sure how good Denver is yet. theyve had a good start and are playing well, but their roster doesnt scare anyone. they play good team ball, but you need someone that can take over a game late, and they dont have anyone even close to that
Darzini::Because the NBA is clamoring for the Wolves to trade Johnson, Beasley, Ridnour, Ellington, Lee, and Darko.
katarcher5::Loaded? wes johnson and wayne ellington playing the 2..thats hardly loaded...AGENT ZERO anyone?
31beef34::open your eyes. go right ahead and call those two out, but the fact of the matter is we have a lot of talent. but nobody said we didn't have some question marks on the team.
paul34135::They are young.. They need to learn to win games like this at the end and then confidence will build for some wins against good teams.
MNmatt27::anyone else see that no call goal tend?!?! that was pretty awful....... even worse after the no call hornets went hit a 3.. smh hard at the refs
paul34135::The NBA is the most pathetic league when it comes to refs and making calls..Favortism is obvious and calls are not.
moeakaspacecowboy::Your right about that.
md7152::that was a big swing.  even the New Orleans Announcers had to admit it was a GT. lol
CandySparker::Love Rubio Love!
tjverwor::All Hail King RUBIO!!!!
notcurlylambow::GOOOoooooo Wolves
Blitz1821::Only 80 points allowed nice, keep it up defense
MNsportswopwopwah::11 games in and were like a quarter of our win total last year
KCMac929::Wes has the tools to be Pippen, but he's so far away it's sad.  Seriously, he can be such a deadly shooter but his shot has no rotation whatsoever.  Someone on the staff please teach him to dribble and get rotation on his shot.
Blitz1821::didn't get to watch the game, who was missing the open shots?
AdamWest234::That draft class might go down as one of the worst of all time.
Blitz1821::That doesn't surprise me, I thought we drafted him because he could make those shots consitently
md7152::Johnson mostly and Luke missed a few that he has been knockin down lately
AdamWest234::Wes Johnson as usual.
md7152::sorry to say but the ball actually moved around a bit better without beasley tonight.  Still some turnovers and a lot of wide open shots missed tho
jack butler505::every time we win without Beasley, people say we're better off without him, and every time we lose without Beasley, people say we're really missing his scoring and ability to create shots
md7152::yes he does
AdamWest234::The last couple games Beasley played I think he realized driving to the hoop suits him better than settling for jump shots.
phil80802::We know. But Beasley has potential.
MNsportswopwopwah::I know I should want the heat to win for our division but damn it feels good to watch Denver stomp them!
AdamWest234::I will take anyone over the heat any day.  I hate everything Chicago sports and I would take them over the Heat.
phil80802::AP IS ALREADY WALKING ON THE ACL, MCL!!!!!! HAHAHA WHAT A BEAST!!!
Dirty Birds are Hot::should still be careful he's ACL is still really weak when he feels its fine.
phil80802::Yea, its awesome.
minnyzona91::fo reals?!! nice

AdamWest234::It is gonna be sweet when DWill learns how to take over a game.  Once that happens this team will be unstoppable.
paul34135::LOL Wild is right on.. We are happy Wolves fans and they are much better that last year..
gowild19::Unstoppable?  You mean .500 team that still has too many holes.  That's a little overreaction to beating one of the leagues worst teams.
MandatoryMadnessInThe763::hey gowild, why you gotta rain on everyones parade.
AdamWest234::They will be better than .500.  Once DWill figures it out you will have two guys (K. Love) who have the ability to play inside and outside.  With Rubio passing the ball that is going to be extremely hard to stop.

minnyzona91::afroninja!!
Legitimately.Kevin::I'm not a Timberwolves fan, or a big NBA fan really, but I find myself checking to see how Rubio did after almost every game.  Still progress to be made but it's great to see this team back on the rise.
gowild19::He should have had about 17 assists tonight.  They missed so many wide open shots.
