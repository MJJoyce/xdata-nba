Deleted::the game should be a good one; don't think you can compare how the clippers will fare against the heat based upon how they played in orlando.  i am a heat fan no doubt but basketball games are won on the court and not based upon how a team plays against another team.  consider that the heat are the champions and the motivation level of the clippers should be up a notch.  i always expect that the heat should come out on top.  yet the clippers will play the heat differently then they played orlando.
Clipperdude::Good game. Heat really shut down cp3. When he has more turnovers than steals the opposing team has done a great job. Good energy by the Clips.
Ronald::I called it last time that the Heat is on a winning streak. 14 winning streak!! After that it could be interesting facing the Pistons team.
Aktion Pak::this is the best the clippers can play while miami heat are just playing around; clippers are playoff team no doubt but doc rivers won't matter; clips will have another 1st or 2nd round exit; this not a coach factor; it's the players; whether vinny or doc doesn't matter; this the same clips team that chokes during playoffs; but to me clips last season are better than current; because they lost their opener to the lowly lakers minus ballhog kobe this season what a joke
WhoseWho::You can't over analyze a back to back game. Tough loss move on.
Femi::Good job, Miami Heat. On to the Boston Celtics.
Princess Luna::Good evening, basketball fans! I hope tonight will be an exciting basketball match!
D&J G::Chalmers should have been ejected for the forearm to Griffen's neck.  I expect a fine and possibly a game suspension next week.
Ignacio::Clippers are what they are. Pretenders!
Chance::Ray Allen will be the oldest player in NBA history to average 10 ppg in a season. Four years from now.
