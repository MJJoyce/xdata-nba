Scottinsd1::I hope Memphis gives Jamaal Franklin more playing time - the kid is amazing. As an SDSU Aztecs season ticket holder, I can attest to the dynamic abilities this player possesses - and I just hope he gets the chance to show the league.
MARK FREDRIC::Russell Westbrook is a beast! With all those free throws that he attempted, we know he loves attacking the basket!
Alvin Adiwira::I'm confused as to what Perkins brings for OKC. He starts games, plays 15 minutes, nothing on boxscores except fouls (and maybe a few dunks here and there for 6 points). Is he like lucky charm for OKC? Wouldn't it be better to start Collison or Thabeet (develop him into a better player, he's younger anyway) and trade Perk? Or those 2 aren't any better than him?
Commenter::thunders wins
Dimez::Westbrook gettin that triple double. after one rebound shy last game
No_Rain_Check::Memphis gonna need a miracle
Eric C::OKC with a little payback. This is too easy, back to back games are supposed to be challenging. Its only halftime, maybe the Grizz will make it entertaining. Either way OKC wins big. THUNDER UP!!!
darryl::if i were Perkins, i would be ashamed to collect my paycheck
jeremiah::I wish Omar Asik would be traded in OKC for (shaq's voice) Kendrick Perkins!
Cleeford Ps::kd is the best
