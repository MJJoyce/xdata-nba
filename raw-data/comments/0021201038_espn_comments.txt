finneb116::Wait, the dunk fest I watched this weekend wasn't the Clippers? It was...FLORIDA GULF COAST? Sorry guys, I'm on the wrong board.
BarrelRider04::Yes, there is a DIRECT correlation between Lamar Kardashian only playing 16 minutes and the Clippers winning. He should NEVER, and I mean NEVER, see any more than 15 minutes a game...PERIOD!!!!!
RNYC_125::It's really a waste to talk trash to net fans as no one is ever on their board.
ADLA4LIFE::such irony written on a Nets/Clippers board, probably not a fan of either to.
gastatefootball::Are clips fans forgetting we beat them last time?
clutchballa06::Haha and still have a better record?
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::"Last time."
flag_me_if_you_can::The only PG in this league that owns CP3 is this scrub Toney Douglas. DWill is overrated
flag_me_if_you_can::JR Smith &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jamal Crawford
TheBREEZ369::lol knicks are garbage you fool
clutchballa06::I'm glad that the old "Deron Williams is better than Chris Paul" nonsense has been out to bed..
Clipper_fan21::Kris Kardashian learned today what happens when you $@%! Chris Paul off
Mike768114::Lets go Nuggets!!!!!   Lets go Nuggets!!!!!
KG turn down CP3::Deandre Jordan needs to be traded to Varejao offseason.
Deaneer32::too injury prone...great player tho
airicad::I wouldn't want that.  Trade for a guy who would never play?  Look at Philly.
GermanKlippa::"Moin" and out........ Anyways, it still is:  Go Clips !!
airicad::I was never in doubt that CP3 was still the best PG in the NBA.    I'm also glad "CP3 time" came back to Staples Center tonight.  I've missed it.  We need to trade Caron after this season though...
leykis201::Butler only has one year left on his contract.... If we want to trade him I'm sure it'll be easy
airicad::I wonder if Milwaukee would be stupid enough to take Butler and Odom for Redick?
airicad::I don't think Chauncey has many years left in him.  Butler is only an average 3 point shooter yet he continues to fire away.    Redick is still 28, and his shooting (and passing) will only improve.  I think he would be a perfect fit for this team.  I would also love to see Barnes start at SF.  I think he could be a good energy guy for the starters and is probably our best best to stop the elite wing scorers in the league.
GermanKlippa::Maybe they are desperated enough to get OLD quality players (kinda rare in Milwaukee I guess)...... Would be a good move by da 'Clips, though.
Deaneer32::That would be beautiful
GermanKlippa::Moin......
jack frrom the titanic::If Nets need a new coach, Dantonio will be available soon
gastatefootball::lets see the playoffs first
matheus1989::PJ IS DOING FINE
XvarriorX::lol
Playa_Haters_Club::So I Guess The Talk Of Deron Williams Always Owning CP3 Are Over Now??????
ckonas::not after one game
Andrew James Bynum::<i>  I will one day surpass K Garnett's NBA achievements.  2 championships ;) for Andrew Bynum</i>
jack frrom the titanic::are spiders camped out in your hair?
Andrew James Bynum::<i> I keep my L.A kush in there. </i>
jack frrom the titanic::Orlando GM must be the all time duesche bag of GM's for turnong down the Nets deal for Dwight Howard
KG turn down CP3::Fact. Gilbert Arenas got paid 22 million dollars this season without even playing.
jack frrom the titanic::he has a family to feed
gt1master_ike::I think Balkman got permanently banned from some Phillipino league for choking a player.
KG turn down CP3::I think Renaldo Balkmam did lol
jack frrom the titanic::I repeat, I did not choke that coach
KG turn down CP3::Sprewell is that you? lol
matheus1989::WHO IS PAYING HIM ALL THAT CASH??
jack frrom the titanic::I think it's orlando, they swapped arenas bad deal for Lewis when dwight was there
KG turn down CP3::He is under contract from Wizards
Andrew James Bynum::<i> You shook me all night long ;)</i>
KG turn down CP3::Fact. Gasol is making more money than Lebron salary wise.
Kobelies247::Just proves james doesnt just care about money.
FadeBackShootAirBall4::a lot of players are making more than lebron
matheus1989::SICK
Rick Grimes.::brooklyn fans are gone!?, damn.
Lebron James Legendary Hairline::lol dude ther are no broolyn fans
ciorizzo::And there are clippers fans ??
jack frrom the titanic::is that your baby?
gt1master_ike::I seriously don't understand Joe Johnson. This dude is playing guard at 6 7 " 240 lbs, has a size advantage over almost every 2 guard he plays yet can not dominate on a consistent basis. Willie Green 6 4" and jamal crawford 6 5" guarding you most of the night and you can't score 20?  Damn.
gastatefootball::he makes the clutch shots and with d will unpredictable we need someone like that.
Kobelies247::Batum for Portland makes close to 50mill and he only scored 5 points last night..
FadeBackShootAirBall4::he plays smaller than he is
FadeBackShootAirBall4::pure dominance
gt1master_ike::Can you imagine if Wade was his size?
Kobelies247::How was it even this close?
MittRomneysLostEthics::One ref had a vendetta against the Clips' second team. Bizarre series of tickle foul calls against Barnes, Hollins, and Odom (14 fouls among them in short period of time) gave the Nets a BIG push. Seemed like a Donaghy.
Rick Grimes.::we won,  clippers beat the nets, bulls beat the pacers,  grizzlies beat the celtics,  great night to be a knicks fan.
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::those are really rare nights for knick fans
matheus1989::HOW MUCH DO U GUYS THINK LEBRON IS WORTH PER YEAR IF HE WAS TO TAKE MAX??  SERIOUSLY KEEP IN MIND WHAT KOBE IS MAKING NOW AND NEXT YEAR
Kobelies247::Moron = MAtheus
matheus1989::DRA TIL HELVETTE DIN JÆVLA DRITT UNGE
FadeBackShootAirBall4::isn't kobe due 30 million next season? lebron should at least be making joe johnson type of money
Kobelies247::Caps = moron
matheus1989::CAPS CAUSE I CAN USE IT U DONT LIKE F.UCK OFF
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::ITS OVER 9000
jack frrom the titanic::So you walk into a poker game to play and Gilbert Arenas is there......Well do you play punk?
KG turn down CP3::Bynum and Arenas got paid millions for sitting on the bench
jack frrom the titanic::other guy is Rasheed Lewis on miami....22 million....the NBA OWNERS instituted the cap after that contract by Orlando
KG turn down CP3::Speaking about good life
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Rose gets paid zillions
KG turn down CP3::With a front row seat view
Andrew James Bynum::I got 2 championship rings ;).  Melo=0    Lebron1    Durant=0      CP3=0       Dwight=0
jack frrom the titanic::Amare is beating out Joe Johnson for the worst contract
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::Amare hasn't contribute to wins? He dominated plenty of games coming off the bench that gave the Knicks the win and when Melo was injured the team was on a win streak with him getting 35 minutes. It sucks that he has knees of glass, but Amare owns Johnson.
FadeBackShootAirBall4::haha no he not..amare is making 100 million and he can't even stay healthy..at least joe johnson can stay healthy and contribute to wins
KG turn down CP3::Gilbert Arenas is that you?
jack frrom the titanic::target shooting these days
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Dont forget yours truly,Andrew Bynum
matheus1989::NO BROOKLYN FANS IN HERE??
KG turn down CP3::They become clippers fans
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Tey are doin their Brooklyn street violent activities
KG turn down CP3::Gone
FadeBackShootAirBall4::paul pierce looks like a rat with no whiskers
HectorPablo.Ortiz@gmail.com::I knew he reminded me of something.
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::I laughed out loud at this
jack frrom the titanic::Nets gave up the 6th pick in the draft for the bust Wallace and portland used that pick pn Lillard....steal
gt1master_ike::I know right. Wallace has flown under the radar this year while Deron Williams and Joe Johnson have been blasted by everyone from fans to the media.
insight668911::LOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOL

insight668911::HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
jack frrom the titanic::i believe it was 40
Ontario925::Hmm now that the Lakers are not winning anymore after 2010 I'm going to be a Heat fan because they stocked up with top players now -Typical NBA bandwagon fan since 2000
Ontario925::I'm not a Craptors fan you idiot. I hate all Toronto sport teams. Always have 40 years ago and always will 40 years from now.
Andrew James Bynum::Raptors suck
wasteland511::Your next team
gt1master_ike::Did D Will lose tonight's game? Maybe but any one who has watched the Nets can not deny he has been balling since the all star break. Its actually Wallace and Johnson that have stayed at their same mediocre level but Wallace put in work today at least.  Brook has been consistent all year with scoring and blocks.
jack frrom the titanic::Kris kardashian is still reeling from getting played by Miss Butte
insight668911::Mr Paul is willing to take a personal check, yes you can make it out to CP3
KG turn down CP3::Like if you believe cp3 should be the MVP this season.
jack frrom the titanic::nah
LeBron James MVPX4::I cannot do that
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Tony Parker sonnnnnnnnnnn
matheus1989::RIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT MVP IS POP
insight668911::Deron Williams Mr. Paul is waiting for his payment for services rendered
LeBron James MVPX4::Williams got served a plate of Paul Pie.
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::D-Will needs to lose weight..he PHAT
KG turn down CP3::He mean chris HUMPHRIES lol
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::My friend told me he was fat so I believed him cause he a Heat fan
LeBron James MVPX4::Sincerely, Paul Pierce
matheus1989::Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs - sINCERELY, Chris Bosh  HOW IS CHRIS BOSH FAT?? COME ON MAN
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::sINCERELY, Chris Bosh
KG turn down CP3::And Raymond felton
CamOverRG3::Deron Williams blew tonight's ball game,a turnover down 2 leading to a easy fast break dunk then giving up a 3 point play on the next possession,all happening in the final minute of the game.
insight668911::That would be because he sucks, I hope he pays mr paul in cash for that point gaurd clinic
KG turn down CP3::Jerry Sloan is that you?
gt1master_ike::Blake needs to work on his face up post game. He should be a dominant inside presence each and every night.
LeBron James MVPX4::Every team that is named the Heat has a chance to win the finals.
LeBron James MVPX4::Get a haircut you bum
Andrew James Bynum::Sign  me in the offseason Miami.
wasteland511::Cleveland
KG turn down CP3::As a floor man
LeBron James MVPX4::As a mascot?
ArticSquarecle::Derrick Rose is softer than a bunch of tulips wrapped in cotton candy.
Andrew James Bynum::I got 2 rings, you mad Charles Barkley?
BigshotRob is the Best::Horry has 7 rings
Kadhirseenthe2bests::lol @ that mug shot....drew is my boy though...get well soon
Andrew James Bynum::Thx man
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::not me --Adam Morrison--
KG turn down CP3::Luke Walton has 3
GermanKlippa::Greets from overseas..... Anyways, it still is:  Go Clips !!
brooklynnets7::bandwagoner
GermanKlippa::Errrr I am rooting for da Clips since the 96/97n campaign (the Eric Piatkowski, Rodney Rogers days you know); it does take a whole lot of devotion and loyalty to pull for for franchise like da Clips for that long with that much losing I can guarentee you....!! BTW, my account was created in 2008 !!
brooklynnets7::how can one say that the Nets are a bad team? They hung in till the end against one of the best teams at home in the league. If CP3 didn't get babied by the refs, the Nets probs wouldn't have lost. Also Joe Johnson got injured on a no-call. If Griffin was injured and the Nets won, all Clippers fans would have declared a Nets victory as null.
DonTeflon357::the Brooklyn  Nets are going to be a threat in the playoffs
insight668911::a threat to what, the record for fastest 1st round exit
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::*Crickets*
brooklynnets7::"how many of us were fans 3 years ago"  *Crickets*
KG turn down CP3::Who?

Kadhirseenthe2bests::Anyone who thinks that wade and bosh could not get miami to at least third in the weak eastern conference...don't know basketball
Kadhirseenthe2bests::come on lebron got a lot of help now...check all the players stats
FadeBackShootAirBall4::@kad..he leads his team in...points.rebounds,assist,steals and field goal percentage..he's also the best defender..he's most valuable to the team
matheus1989::DOESNT MATTER IS THE BEST PLAYER ON HIS TEAM MOST VALUABLE TO THEM AND THE BEST PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE.. U CAN ASK ANY EXPERT AND THE WHOLE NBA ALREADY KNOWS WHO IS WINNING THIS YEAR.. CP3 HURT HIS CHANCES WHEN HE GOT HURT
matheus1989::WHO IS THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER ON THE BEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE?? IM WAITING
FadeBackShootAirBall4::@celtics..spurs were winning without parker
gt1master_ike::Tony Parker is not even MVP on his own team. It is Popovich.
matheus1989::Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs - Tony Parker  RIGHT CAUSE THE SPURS ARE THE BEST TEAM WITH THE BEST RECORD SMH
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Tony Parker
FadeBackShootAirBall4::semi-finals and that's it
Kadhirseenthe2bests::fair enough
Andrew James Bynum::Hit me up on PS3.  psn name is Andrew G.O.A.T Bynum
LeBron James MVPX4::PS3 has bowling?
KG turn down CP3::Come to clippers
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::be careful with your knees
LeBron James MVPX4::If you're not a 1-4 seed in the west you are out in the first round.  period
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::1-5 seed correction

Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::NBA's current top 5  James   Paul  Durant  Parker  Conley
KG turn down CP3::Paul first
