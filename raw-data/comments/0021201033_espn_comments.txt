Chris 972::If the Bobcats get the first pick  how would you feel about trading it to OKC for Perry and lamb ?
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::LMAO. That's how I feel about it.
bobcats 2020 nba champs::one step closer to a 1 over all pick
StompYourFace25::blasphemous asinine ridiculous pitiful dumb dim witted clueless stupid foolish  are word I can use to describe the ATROCITY named the Charlotte Bobcats  still a fan for life though
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Lol. Me too. But after a 1 point loss? Ease up a bit.
WonderlicQBR::I wanted to say I feel sorry for MJ..Then I said why??? He is still a freaking Millionaire...Life is still good for him...but his team is bad....
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Really? This is what you want to contribute for a team coming off a 2 game win streak in a 1 point loss? This is a positive for the team. They're rebuilding, had an awful stretch of getting beat by 15+ nightly and for the past 3 weeks have played solid ball. I'll take 1 point losses (with an aim of getting another top pick) over getting blew out any night. Even if it's to the lowly Pistons who have been rebuilding longer than we have and are still struggling.
AGirlThatLovesSports_::really hate espn.
detroitpistonsarethebest::This is our first game we have won in March...
Votto4mvp005065::damn detroit might have just ended any playoff hopes for charlotte
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Such a generic comment.
charliharper::Lol.
evanb1990a::So I just noticed they purged about 40 minutes of conversation, huh
mdsteveb33::Does anyone know how many games the Bobcats have lost in the 4th qtr this year? Seems like they have the lead a lot then put up less than 20 in the 4th
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::There has been a few. I know we've blew leads against the Lakers twice, Portland, New York, Detroit, Toronto, and a few other teams.
Talentsojhin::5 or 6  at least
dont_hate_the_playa_hate_the_game::you know what's real pathetic? charlotte is waste, and the owner stands by and allows them to be waste.
The Bobcats Will Contend One Day::Hey clown, we don't all have the luxury of living in a tax free state or having beaches and rappers to attract to city. You see how you get all of those top 5 picks on your team (Lebron, Wade, Bosh?), we're doing our part to get our top 5 picks since players aren't going to flock to Charlotte. I'm glad Jordan is standing by and not getting caught up in trying to hurry up and put together a bottom seed squad in the playoffs. It's best to be patient and acquire these top picks. And it's funny how none of your teams are geographically close at all but 3 of the 4 have won major sports titles in the past few years with the fourth being the Braves who always have a pretty strong fan base. But are you a nut rider or what?
dont_hate_the_playa_hate_the_game::um...yeah. only if we spot them 50.
TCluvcarpanthers::They're beating the Heat, tommorow.
TCluvcarpanthers::This one hurts.  But, it was a good game.  GG Pistons fans.
Chris 972::I think UNC is going to win tomorrow
AGirlThatLovesSports_::Tough lost cats
Chris 972::Do you really love Sports?
AGirlThatLovesSports_::Sí Senor
TheJTram::So yeah, good game, #FireFrank, all that good stuff
TheJTram::Damn even Maxiell -gulps- played decent? That's it the world is ending
TCluvcarpanthers:::(((((((((((((((((
jazzmantitch::Nice choke.
Chris 972::What happened to the pistons?
evanb1990a::So um what about the guy who bet it all on CHA -2.5?  Yikes
jazzmantitch::His ticket is confetti.
GameOnDeck24::nice tanking bobcats you actually helped your cause by losing this game
TheJTram::Charlie V?Being clutch? I refuse to accept this
AWG313::Was that a pass or a shot?
Catchin Feelings On ESPN::He thought he was getting fouled.
TCluvcarpanthers::Well this hurts.
smackdab0::holy cow.. its about time.. how many in a row had we lost before this?
smackdab0::thanks..
TheJTram::10
Catchin Feelings On ESPN::Good game...new somehow the Bobcats would lose this
TheJTram::Usually that's us lol
DoyerBlue32::Losing streak ends!  Losing streak ends!  But the big picture is, Charlotte wins because losses equals more ping pong balls!
evanb1990a::...Charlie V carries the Pistons to victory?  Welcome to Bizarro World. The 2012 World Series was fought between the Astros and Twins.
Talentsojhin::Charlie V the all-star...always against the Bobcats..
TheJTram::Gotta stop Kemba. He's a Piston killer
MansGame5313::Now for the love of all that is holy keep kemba walker out of the damn paint
Catchin Feelings On ESPN::Jordan is lacing them up
TCluvcarpanthers::C'mon Kemba..........
