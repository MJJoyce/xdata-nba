Manuel Karem::I love that Calderon is receiving some love. Smart player, has a lot of heart, and knows how to ball. Keep his minutes up when Kyle comes back
TigerMichLion111::Maybe two of the worst teams in basketball, but hey this has ALCS written all over it!
MichiganTechHuskies88::Pistons are THE BEST TEAM EVER!!!!!! I've never seen a better team in my life....except every basketball team above high school level.
Conky Bubs::Canadian Bacon?
My girlfiend is very famous::Blue Jays and tigers
My girlfiend is very famous::T
My girlfiend is very famous::This game feautered the bottom feeders of the league
Rip City Forever::Is Toronto the worst team in the league??
Leafsfankenny67::No
slawsondawson::Been using a betting system called Sportsbettingstar. I am making around 2-3K a month profit using this systems picks. You will find the system on the first page of Google by searching for sports betting systems. I have bet on sports a couple of years and have tried various systems in the past and nothing even comes close to comparing to how well this system works.
slawsondawson::WINNING!
TheRealB.Young::i make 50grand a night with it
Oklahoman2424::Keep staying right around that 22-26th rank range Toronto. I can't wait to watch the NBA's best Thunder get a top 10 pick this year (maybe even top 5)!!!
TheRealB.Young::btw raptors will beat okc in the finals
TheRealB.Young::This draft sucks anyway
BK HOTSHOT::Bargs days are numbered. The Raptors are showing they don't need him after making that comment, that the Raptors were the worst team in the NBA. I guess someone took those comments to heart. It shouldn't be hard to trade a Big man these days. Maybe the Brooklyn Nets are willing to trade Lopez &amp; Humpries for Bargs &amp; Fields? or Bargs &amp; Amir Johnson? Bargs &amp; Lowry?
Nawknai::Why the hell would the Nets do that?
23tomie23::raptors are sweet
detroit dave93::Ya, as vinegar
wnsj89::Game 1 against DET Bargnani scores 34 and Lowry 19 but TOR loses 91-90  Game 2 against DET Calderon dishes 17 assists balancing the Raps scoring and they win 97-91  Calderon last 3 games: triple double, team high 23 pts against CLE, 17 assists tonight  most important stat though:  Raps are now 6-6 in games that Calderon starts
Leafsfankenny67::Yes. If he keeps it up I might have to buy his jersey after all
o0st44::Keep Lowry. Dump Barngani.
torrtis::Calderon should never have been on the bench at the start of the season.
Jordan014-23::<b> Playoff??? </b>
detroit dave93::"SURE PLAYOFFS"  Detroit &amp; Toronto, in the eastern conference finals. C'MON MAN, at the end of the year both the Pistons &amp; Raptors will be part of the bottom four. Don't take a rocket scientist to figure out the other two.
tmlforever493::As a Torontonian, I don't understand this "4th straight win" thing. Is this good?
BK HOTSHOT::Go back to watching your Hockey!
19brom::are u kidding me??? of course it is
blamblam69::nope
BEastChamps2013::Brandon Knight sucks... he shoots too much. Ball hog.
detroit dave93::Really, it wouldn't be so bad if he would at least have a few of his shots go in 2 pts, in 36 minutes, "ARE YOU KIDDING ME!
wnsj89::sounds like Kyle Lowry
Calvin Johnson 1849 Yards::Pistons need Shabazz Muhammed. They could contend for like a 4 seed with 1- Knight 2- Stuckey/Singler 3-Muhammed 4/5- Monroe/Drummond
Philip3664::I thought Muhammed was a 2. He seems kinda small to be a 3. How tall is he?
iVoted4Kodos.::He prob still growing.
Calvin Johnson 1849 Yards::6-6. He's listed as a 3 but probably will play a 2 in the NBA. Either way, he fills a need for the Pistons.
iVoted4Kodos.::And they would still have free agent money.
Calvin Johnson 1849 Yards::1. Knight 2. Mayo/Muhammed 3. Muhammed/Smith 4. Drummond 5. Monroe would be a sick lineup
iVoted4Kodos.::If Gores was serious, after the draft, he would: amnesty Charlie, make a play for one of Josh Smith/OJ Mayo/Paul Millsap, fire Frank and hire a big name. He's got the money.
Calvin Johnson 1849 Yards::which could net a solid 2/3. especially when Charlie V leaves
wnsj89::Points in the paint: DET 50 TOR 32  Rebounds: DET 44 TOR 33  this is why we need Gasol
Encaladitos::Lakers has been said dont want to trade Gasol currently cause promised Nash he would get to play with him. Have to wait and see what happens when they play together.
Encaladitos::Wiz who they play next believe or not is a good rebounding team lol.
Encaladitos::Det that is
gcd8::maybe they could get one of jazz big man like milsap or big al
iVoted4Kodos.::Either one would be a coup for Toronto imo.
wnsj89::hmmm, interesting..not sure he is available though, Gasol's 8.8 RPG would still help with what we have now
gcd8::gasol is pretty soft, they need like perkins
detroit dave93::Pistons play the Wizards at home next, they will probably loose that one to. For one thing Frank doesn't know  what in the hell he'is doing, not a clue.
Encaladitos::Wizards havent been as bad lately been competitive in last couple games.
iVoted4Kodos.::Nene wasn't there for the disastrous opening losing streak.
iVoted4Kodos.::Back to back home/away. These two games could be determinative in the lottery.
iVoted4Kodos.::"TheJTram - B.itch please, we got the 1st pick &lt;.&lt;"  This cheered me up, as long as Pistons get a top 6 pick, Even Joe D can't mess it up.
gcd8::look at 2010 nba draft besides monroe everybody else hasn't done much
iVoted4Kodos.::Yeah, Joe D has drafted well very recent, but look at 2009. He chose Daye instead of tons of great PG's. Easy to draft well when your picks are that high in lottery.
Philip3664::Too bad we cant get another draft class like 03. Maybe Joe D would make the right decision second time around
gcd8::i don't know the college talent level is so watered down these days, it keeps feeling like the last few drafts have been weaker and weaker
iVoted4Kodos.::Funny, cause I like the French guy Gobert, huge wingspan and hands.
cdnpaul33::Another win w/o Bargnani and Lowry. I think that says a lot.
gcd8::lowry jacks up too many shots, the raptors shoot to many 3's need get ball inside more
Encaladitos::Maybe do what GS is doing use a 3 guard line up when Lowry is back
gcd8::yeah trade them both they are obviously hurting the team
VanCityRep::bargs is
detroit dave93::Raptor fans I was going to say nice game, but hell it's easy to beat another team when they only have 1 player that wanted to play tonight,  Monroe vs. Raptors.
VanCityRep::he's a keeper
Philip3664::I remember there was talk of us trading for Calderon. I wouldnt mind that trade right about now.
Philip3664::i can understand Max but i dont think anybody wants Charlie lol
gcd8::det needs lowry
Encaladitos::Calderon value is as high as it is going to get right now.
tripleteamthreat::Probably get Deron Williams straight up.  Obviously the money doesn't work, but BKN would consider it!
TheJTram::We could give away Maxie and  Charlie, I mean Maxie grabs more boards at his size than Barg does as a 7-footer
tripleteamthreat::Exactly, nobody wants him.
VanCityRep::nobody wants him
5891jonathan::he is an assist-o-matic!
VanCityRep::monroe is about the only asset
Encaladitos::BK has promise but dont think Raps need more shooters.
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Yeah, Monroe is the only player I'd want on the Pistons team right now...
5891jonathan::Calderon - why isn't he playing more?  I realize he played a lot of minutes tonight
5891jonathan::I know, he played a lot tonight.  Pretty amazing efficiency
tripleteamthreat::Didn't he play enough tonight?  17 assists while DET had 15.
VanCityRep::Next vs orlando i think, ANOTHER WINNABLE GAME
gcd8::nah that would be woodson from ny
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Yeah, the Orlando coach has to be the front runner for coach of the year...
gcd8::raptors have always been decent at home, fixing the road  problems that's what's gotta change
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Winnable, maybe, but Orlando is coming in hot...
tripleteamthreat::Orlando actually made out pretty good considering all the changes!
19brom::goin to the game! pretty pumped, only cause were going for 5 in a row
gcd8::raptors could  keep winning til they go to san antonio that will be a blowout
JimDetroitFan95::This is getting to be beyond depressing..........  When the Pistons need a key basket in the latter part of the game, nobody wants to shoot it.  You cannot and will not win with a team with that mentality and ability.
gcd8::depends on who david stern feels like giving it to
19brom::haha very true
gcd8::with the 2nd pick in the nba draft the pistons select   _____________
TheJTram::B.itch please, we got the 1st pick &lt;.&lt;
BillyMaysHere92::Pretty much...
TheJTram::That's what happens when you're missing big playmakers. Billups, Rip, hell even Big Ben had that strong mentality as well at his old age
Qiox::Only problem with trading Bargnani.  What team and is going to look at him and say, "Ya, that's what we need!"
KnucknBUC::hopefully for not just gasol need more if youre getting caldy def need a 1st in the deal but don't think lakers gonna give that up
Francis4345::Jazz would trade Jefferson for Barg since he's at 15M$/year and renew is contract next summer. Kanter could take his place and share minutes with Bargnani
JoeyDorsey4MVP::No, Utah would want to shed more salary not pay Bargs 20 million for an extra two years.
Encaladitos::Lakers want calderon Raptors could force them to take Barg also as some sorta multi team deal.
BillyMaysHere92::We want a soft 7 footer that complains about his team when he loses. That's our guy!
gcd8::duncan is getting older, maybe they could get k leonard,  d green
Encaladitos::Spurs want Varajeo
gri400::some stupid team will, if not we can just amnesty him if needed :)
wnsj89::Lakers
gcd8::spurs would take him
19brom::ya think?
I Love My Mullet::no harm losing to the 2013 NBA Champs there Pistons fans!
gcd8::is that on the video game
BillyMaysHere92::As Pistons fans, we know all about foreign flops *Cough Cough* Darko Milicic
JoeyDorsey4MVP::You guys didn't need Milicic, considering you won the championship that year. But you missed out on Melo, Bosh, and Wade.
BillyMaysHere92::True, but our management broke apart a great team for an overrated Iverson...  SMH
BillyMaysHere92::One of the most loaded draft classes ever and we pick the dud...
BillyMaysHere92::Pretty much. I honestly don't know if I would want all those premadonnas on our team anyway...
tripleteamthreat::Basically, the current MIA team was available!
tripleteamthreat::Because Carmelo Anthony was available!  Thanks JOE!
TheJTram::^ Why did we get him in the 1st place...
TheJTram::I know...even if we won the championship that year, we coulda got guys like Wade, Bosh, West, Melo, etc.
BillyMaysHere92::I believe that's the worst Pistons pick EVER
t casey::Monroe def had his best game of the year tonight. I wonder how much better we'd look if we could get him and Knight playing well together. So far when one is playing well, the other is playing like total crap.
19brom::thats for sure
gcd8::pistons made so many bad free agent decisons, ben gordon, charlie v,  they got alot of problems ,
supremekid912::4 game win streak for Toronto,the world is ending in 2 days
19brom::hahahaha funny
Raptorsfan080::FOURRR IN A ROWWW BABYYY!
tripleteamthreat::MONROE finishes with 35 points.  Where were the rest of the PISTONS tonight?
iVoted4Kodos.::Two of the are in the D League, would have liked to see them play after it was clear Daye &amp; Knight didn't have it tonight.
Magicfraga::so whats the score jesus christ you guyys
JimDetroitFan95::I sure miss hockey.........................
gcd8::raptors should send a package deal to lakers trade lowry and barn yard,  take meeks gasol
gcd8::well toronto needs to trade andrea
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Yeah, we're on agreement with that. Unfortunately, we'll get no value for him so it might just be better to sit him..
JoeyDorsey4MVP::LA actually really needs Meeks...and we don't .
tripleteamthreat::Tough to put MEEKS in any trade right now.  How about Gasol and Duhon for Bargnani and Calderon?
Philip3664::Is that a career high for Greg?
Philip3664::nevermind..i see over there&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
4th and 29::Calderon has stepped up his game. Now if Only Andrea can do that same.
KnucknBUC::Id rather his lazy $@% just get traded for a bag of rocks
gri400::he can't, because he sucks
19brom::hahaha gcd8 is a wizard fan!!!!
tripleteamthreat::Singler waits 3 seconds to foul KLEIZA
Magicfraga::final? Score? time left? cmon fellas
Qiox::97-91 Raps with 4 minutes 85 seconds left in the 4th half.
Mutuum::97-91 final
VanCityRep::97 91 final
jaykel0621::18-30 at the line, difference in winning and losing.   Free throws
Raptorsfan080::OFFICIALLY ON THE TRADE BARGNANI BANDWAGON! GOOO RAPTORSS
Urban_Legend2::....push over...!!!!
gri400::getting cramped on that bandwagon... welcome aboard!
gcd8::8-19 now for the raptors only 6 games behind the 8 spot, u got a chance
gcd8::i like the vancouver grizz
KnucknBUC::Yea playing for the right to get swept by the heat boy.
19brom::haha shut up ya wizard fan
Encaladitos::Why dont you tell us who our team is.
JoeyDorsey4MVP::Ugly, win Toronto you guys better shape-up for Orlando on Friday.
BillyMaysHere92::Toronto can definitely beat the Magic
Urban_Legend2::Not gonna happen.....it's gonna be another ugly, mental mistake filled game by the Raps...
Alex_TO::We're losing, people aren't happy, we're winning, people aren't happy, take one win at a time and enjoy it
jagzman04::Downer alert!
4th and 29::Raptors ready to send 2 draft picks to Boston in exchange for 3 packs of ice to freeze Bargnani.   Both teams &amp; fans happy with the trade.
BillyMaysHere92::GG Raps fans. Hopefully the Raptors fortune changes here soon. I've got fond memories of Vince Carter when I was first watching basketball. Hopefully you guys get back there soon.
19brom::thanks
Urban_Legend2::We're a long way from it, but thanks for the words...
BillyMaysHere92::So are we haha
Urban_Legend2::LMFAO...NOW Casey takes a timeout????
Philip3664::Nice game by Greg. Crappy game as a team.
adrudi775::B. Knight going 1-10 from the field did not help
VanCityRep::he's a keeper
