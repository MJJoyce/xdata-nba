Jeff::When you have John Lucas and Richard Jefferson in your starting lineup, you are in a world of hurt.
Johnrey::Should be easy for Dallas after their great performance against Houston.
Anton::NBA should punish Jazz for blatant tanking and change the draft with #1 pick going to the #1 team NBA Champions Miami Heat! Chalmers Wade Wiggins LeBron Bosh, now THAT is a DREAM TEAM.
PKM::Dirk for 3
Marty::At what point do you fire Corbin and bring Jerry Sloan back? Corbin isn`t a good coach. He`s barely a presence on the floor.
David::You should love being a Jazz fan right now.  Just be patient.  Next year's college draft will pay off big time for them.
Be Yourself::Dallas will not going anywhere, they're not that good.
Ghost::If the Jazz coaches were White, would they still be coaching?
Commenter::Shayne Larking sucks!
Brett M::I'm excited to see Trey Burke play tonight, and I'm definitely excited for what's to come for this franchise in the future.  However, my friends thing Trey Burke is going to make this team competitive, but don't get your hopes up.  He's a rookie and will no doubt struggle.  I hope Hayward continues to struggle so we can ship his #$%$ out of here before next year.
