Blitzbolt::The nets are worst team I seen this season how SAD.
urbandigsnyc::The NETS really need to look at A) their defense and lax play there and B) how often they fizzle out mentally and physically in the final 3 min of every da,m game! I mean, 2 turnovers in final 3 min...really? After fighting all game, and stupid avoidable turnovers too. Losses like this show a team that either doesnt believe or has no confidence in themselves to finish a game. Just hoping these are fixable and return of Brook Lopez brings some energy and emotion out of our guys
Jhe1125::the grizzlies when healthy are one of the most formidable teams in the league
KingGeorge53::A good team yes.    Formidable... no.
gotigersmemphis87::Really bro? Look at the record. Now realize they are playing without their best player Zach Randolph, a 20-10 machine, and their most solid bench contributer in Darrell Arthur
tideprankster::watching the uni they wore against the jazz is the most formidable thing about the grizzles
frizzeli::Fukking sketchy as fukl
royboy1978::Eh?
The_Boomtown_Rats::Go Memphis
nu life::My grizz scared me throughout this one.  I was looking at the Houston,OKC game hoping to keep pace with hou.  And hoping Portland would lose.  But the the grizz gave another demonstration of heart and won without any help.  What about those earlier post saying the grizz have no heart.
royboy1978::Tab is still open buddy :)

imichalak2310::I think Lionel needs to find a way to get some minutes out of Sam Young. The man was a solid starter last year in the playoffs and this year he never plays at all.
Mets2410::has he been good? I'm a big Pitt fan Young and Blair were my favorites back then I hope he turns out to be decent.
royboy1978::Eh, this hasn't been his best year.
royboy1978::I believe that Sam just recently hurt his leg.
netsbucs::IDGAF BRING LOPEZ NOW!!!, and i hope farmar comes soon
DPetro10::Williams you want a trade $@%!$@ earn it all you do is turn the ball over and blame team mates
netsbucs::AY! never say that again. Williams must stay, if ur a nets fan u must realize what he brings for us. he is one player i never want to see leave. btw brooks had the most turnovers
netsbucs::that's y lopez got to come soon to help deron
Mets2410::ya totally agree. also when you have such a HUGE roll in the Nets offense like D-Will does I'm not surprised he turns the ball over as much as he does. He's doing a great job he probably has the single heaviest offensive load to shoulder in the entire NBA.
DPetro10::He wants out if we dont get howard
DPetro10::to cocky can only score off rebounds in my book
netsbucs::how???????????
DPetro10::I $@%!$@ hate howard
Mets2410::and we are the favorites to get Howard so what's your point?
Mets2410::he never said he wanted to be traded dude jeez relax D-Will is the only reason this game was close.
super_lintendo_101::NETS SUCK AND BROOK WONT MAKE THEM ANY GOOD.
Mets2410::KNICKS HAVEN'T WON A PLAYOFF GAME SINCE 2000 AND LIN WON'T CHANGE THAT. Get out of here $@%!$@% troll. Can't wait for the D-Will and Dwight led Nets to totally smash the Knicks.
netsbucs::u never know till u see that actually happen
chicityfan91::Once Memphis gets Z-Bo back no one will want to face them in the playoffs, just like last year, they will make noise.
thekola::so now jordan farmer is hurt too? the nets are like their own episode of Grey's anatomy.
Mets2410::really Farmar is out too? Wow, not only is our defense historically bad but so are our injuries......
joe kj2::Nets don't give any effort defensively and I think that reflects on the coach. Avery needs to light a fire under these guys a**** and have them give more of an effort defensively.
urbandigsnyc::totally agree..I mean, do they watch tape of themselves on defense? And they get so lazy in the final 2-3 min of every game! DAMMIT FINISH STRONG! 2 consecutive stupid tuirnovers in final 3 min..brutal
Mets2410::ya they are the worst defensive team since I think the sonics of like 20 years ago. while D-Will is the only player on the team who actually should be a starter in the NBA, they just are really bad on d
royboy1978::Grizzlies and Tigers win tonight.  This Memphis fan is happy!!!!!!!
royboy1978::19-7 so far.  Plus, we're heading to the Big East in 2013.
tds2n::tIgers are young, but good. Picking up steam lately. they started out ranked the top 10, they should end the season in the top 25.
wkdavis85::As much as I would love to see the TIgers back in the top 25, I don't see that happening. They are too inconsistent.
Titans Yemen::congratulation for the city of memphis.
Mets2410::Memphis Tigers? How are they doing this year?
Dickface McCoy::alright and thats why i'll always be a hockey fan over a basketball fan. leggo devilss. good try nets but we all know we wont be able to win until after the all star break
royboy1978::I knew that you were a fairweather fan.
Dickface McCoy::Still questioning my loyalty eh?
tds2n::PREDATORS!!!
Mets2410::go Devils!
Dickface McCoy::i gotta give you props nets, mets, devils fan we are one and the same
Griss13ears::I complain about Speights a lot, but he looked unstoppable tonight. Good to see him play so well on the road. GnG Grizz!!!
Griss13ears::Memphis will be deep next year. Marc/Z-Bo and Mo/DA!! That is a scary front court....I'm drooling.
royboy1978::Speights is very inconsistent.  He needs to play his A game every night.
Titans Yemen::If he play every game like that , the grizzlies will be very dangerous this year.
Mathew8096::thank you and good night

royboy1978::GRIT N MOTHERF-CKING GRIND GRIZZ!!!!!!!!!
Mets2410::good game grizzlies lucky the nets started playing like a 6th grade cyo team down the stretch $@%!$@% ridiculous. grizz got a good team though only gonna get better with Z-Bo but what the $@%!? speights 20 and 18?? you gotta be $@%!$@% kidding me....
netsbucs::f#@k the refs they pick the winner before the game even starts.
netsbucs::i might of exaggerated but the refs suck plan and simple
netsbucs::how can u not agree do watch games i mean the refs suck this year
scrapnice::yeah right.........they  picked memphis over jersey?.....c'mon dude
Griss13ears::Nothing more pathetic than b!tching about the refs.
Mets2410::ya i agree whining about the refs is annoying but give him a break all us nets fans are $@%!$@% pissed that was HORRIBLE execution down the stretch and you know that tons of people whine about the refs all the time whenever there team loses. nets still would've lost this game but I think the ref missed one call on Brooks' turnover at the end. Looked like a bad pass but it also looked like Allen grabbed D-Will around the shoulder and held him back from getting to the ball....
