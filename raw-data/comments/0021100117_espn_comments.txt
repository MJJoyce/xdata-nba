xrobologyx::Mavs will gel and be rolling in no time
T8ke_A_Picture::The only likable person on the Mavs is Jason Kidd, the rest is just dirty players especially Dirk. He needs to take a bath and get that dirt off of him and maybe he won't get sick that much and not be a walking germ bag, that put his teammates in danger.
Mikslik1::but doesn't Kidd like Dirk?
Mavsolute Beast 41::u wanna blow Kidd...we know it
Silverygreen971::Another chOklahoma fan bitter about the Western Conference Beatdown. If your mad about losing to the Mavs maybe next time you shouldnt choke in the 4th Quarter.
clakey2::Never too early to troll I guess.
dash2k4::It was nice to see Vince get up and dunk on someone again after so long. Then I thought, he won't be able to do that again for another five months.
tpotatom::David Stern was right. The Clippers offer was so much better for NO.  The franchise is so much more valuable now!
R Bond::Tied for 8th in the west!  Finally got a playoff spot...
Be safe...wear a Jimmer::Heat own the Mavs!
samwise_atx::Talk about "owned"...
A Red Stapler::Yea, that's why the Heat just beat the Mavs in June for the title...  Oh wait...
TheGoodDoc365::Ughhh, VC gettin nasty with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TheGoodDoc365::Ok, where is the Recap? Wanna see some highlights.
marcus-s2981::Why is Dirk playing so bad??
Mavsolute Beast 41::I'm afraid his last season knee injury is disturbing him.He was wearing a sleeve on it on several games this season
CaptainKirkman::Mavs are slowly getting better. It hasn't been pretty and Dirk has been slow but it's good to see them pull it together. Roddy needs some more minutes, if he gets his confidence back up he can be dangerous again. Kidd being out will help him and West
Mikslik1::Roddy needs to quit jacking 30 ft threes with 20 on the shot clock...
BOPPAZ AND CHOPPAZ::WITH THE 1st PICK IN THE 2012 NBA DRAFT, THE DALLAS MAVERICKS SELECT....
Oriley304::loser
A Red Stapler::He goes around random boards picking random teams and begins the sentence "WITH THE 1st PICK IN THE 2012 NBA DRAFT, THE ...". Just trollin.
T8ke_A_Picture::Thunder 7-2 &gt; Mavs 4-5  8th seed slipping away from the ghey Mavericks.
Way Klaro::As long as you have a stupid point guard in OKC you have no chance of winning against championship teams like the Mavs!
Way Klaro::This dallas team is very dangerous once the get more chemistry. Coming playoffs they will peak while the Spurs will get injured! Lol!  Let's go Mavs!
BOPPAZ AND CHOPPAZ::"PLAYOFFS!!"...."PLAYOFFS!!"
Mavsolute Beast 41::Good win! On to the next one! MFFL
wreckem tech101::Alright Mavs!!! Hope y'all can keep it going now, catch y'all on tuesday guys. MFFL
