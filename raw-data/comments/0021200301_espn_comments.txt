BarcelonaCatalunya::Time to play Royce White!
Jeremy Lin v2.0::I rule!  The END  :-P
mspearlmay::Lin can't play with Hardin.  Lin can't play with Melo.  Okay, do you propose Lin just play by himself?  Lin is weak in body and mind and just not NBA quality.  If he were white, black or other, he would have been dumped a long time ago.   Lin is killing himself trying to live up to hype.  He believes the hype which is his downfall.  Oh, yeah, and god must not want him to be a winner just to include his religious member of the flock mentality.
PatriotsReign88::guess the race of the poster.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say: black.
Dawan208::You obviously don't know anything about the nba or you wouldn't be talking nonsense .    You are mindset is exactly like those in Lins pass who said he doesn't deserve a basketball scholarship,  or doesn't deserve to be drafted,  or can't play in the nba.    You couldn't have seen the last game against the spurs because this proves Lin does belong in the nba.   Lin put up 38 points against an elite team!!!!    So Keep your lame comments to yourself because you know nothing about basketball!!!!!!
cmaster96::haters gonna hate
Paul Apoundstone::Since when did we consider women's opinions as valid comments?   This neo-feminism movement won't let anyone eat.    .
sproketjoe::Give it up.
FLC-8R::Yes, because we know anyone can just score 38 pts against Spurs.
kingsdynasty12::s t f u that is
kingsdynasty12::$@%! hater
rEdBuLxTaSy::DELFINO COULD HAVE BEEN THE WINNING FACTOR FOR THE ROCKETS IN THIS GAME BUT HE WAS COLD, SHOOTING 2-12 FG (1-5 3 PTS) IN 38 MINUTES OF PLAY THAT COULD HAVE NOT GONE INTO OVERTIME. OH WELL GOOD HUSTLE OVERALL BY A YOUNG REBUILDING TEAM :):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::LIN IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN HE'S THE PRIMARY BALL HANDLER.  WHEN EVER THERE'S A STAR PLAYER PLAYING ALONG SIDE, HE TENDS TO STEP ASIDE AND STARTS PLAYING PASSIVE.  I'M CURIOUS IF HE'S INSTRUCTED TO PLAY THAT WAY OR NOT?  WHATEVER IT IS,  I STRONGLY BELIEVED IT HAS ALOT TO DO WITH THE COACHING STAFF.    HARDEN HAS SHOWN THAT HE CAN BE A GOOD TEAM PLAYER IF HE WANTS TO BE.  I REALLY HOPE THEY CAN FORM A MUTUAL PARTNERSHIP ON THE COURT CAUSE THAT WOULD BE DANGEROUS.:):):)
rtatrt::I don't think that's a good example because whether Gnobili starts or not, Tony Parker is the PG and he runs the offense. That's what Houston needs to do. McHale must tell everyone on the team Lin is the PG and the offense goes through him. I think Harden will actually benefit if that happens.
ldssdl::I think a better example is Tony Parker and Manu from the Spurs, or OKC last year. Manu is more than capable of starting, but Coach P brings him off the bench cause it's better for the system and the team. Or even though Harden is clearly starting material, OKC brought him off the bench last year. They should start just one, and bring the other off the bench to provide that spark and keep the offensive consistency going, because both Harden and Lin operate best with the ball in their own hands.
latronchang::Maybe they should switch off.  It's like having two quarterbacks in football.
rtatrt::That's a great point which I made earlier in this thread. Lin can be a star when he runs the team as he did in NY last year until Anthony returned. When Carmelo was in the lineup, Lin stopped running the team and deferred to him. I've noticed this year he's doing the same thing with Harden. After he passes mid-court, he just gives the ball to Harden and gets out of the way.  It was no accident last night that the real Jeremy Lin showed up when Harden was out of the lineup. I think it's still early and McHale has a chance to correct the conflict between them and make sure everyone understands Lin, not Harden, is the team leader.
JustPlayBall1234::It has to come from the coach.  Both players are good and willing to share.
JustPlayBall1234::Watched Coach's postgame interview.  He was really hopping on the last play in regulation!! Don't think he'll give Lin more minutes based on that!! Poor kid.
carlvu1::And Lin's 34 pts before that is negated by his last play in regulation.  Will bench Lin.  -Coach
masterp0703::Well, Danny Green did kind of make him his b!tch
rEdBuLxTaSy::THAT SUCK BALLS IF IT'S TRUE.  IT ALWAYS APPEAR THAT PEOPLE LOVE TO PICK ON ASIANS BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TIMID AND RESERVED.  WHAT A CROCK OF $H.IT THAT IS!!!
Tuoi56::Harden and LIN combo will work only  when Harden learns to share the ball like the Spurs and allow LIn to penetrate to the basket or dish out to the open man.   LIN is the PG man. Act like one Rockets.
JustPlayBall1234::Or Lin can be the 6th man and come off the bench. He'll have more opportunities, hone is craft and get the second unit better too.  Win Win.
Tuoi56::Let LIn be the true PG for a team. And we saw what happen last night.   LIn can easily stat 15pts a night. Let your PG control the ball Rockets. why is your SG becoming a ball handler and ball hogging everyday???
rEdBuLxTaSy::I DON'T WANT TO BE SO HARD ON HARDEN BUT ALOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE COACH.  HOPEFULLY THIS GAME WILL OPEN THEIR EYES AND BUILD UP THEIR TRUST IN LIN :):):)
latronchang::Even if Lin does "suck", he should still be in the NBA.  Think of it as affirmative action in sports.
latronchang::There were 3 Rockets players with 20+ points.  Douglas almost became the 4th (with 17 points).  Lin does need to be the focal point if they want to make the most out of that big contract.  If I were that knowledgeable, I wouldn't be on here.  And, Tuoi, I didn't say Lin sucked.  Look at the quotes, d***head.  It was a sarcastic joke.
rtatrt::You don't sound very knowledgeable. When Lin is allowed to be the team leader, he can become a star. If he's passive and just gives the ball to Harden  he's just an average PG. Lin needs to be the focal point of the offense, that's when he's most effective.
Tuoi56::you funny man. haha. he does not suck . you suck.
latronchang::The Rockets have the potential to have the best team if the coaches can get it together.  Like I said in an earlier post, the Rockets have so many players capable of 20 point nights.  They average more than 100 points a night.  If the talent is utilized right, Parsons, Asik, Harden, Lin, Douglas, and Patterson can all have 20 point nights.
NguyenDragon::I disagree... Rockets are rebuilding but we need to progress in the right direction...
NguyenDragon::This is not a popular idea but maybe have Lin run second unit while Harden runs the first...
rEdBuLxTaSy::THEY COULD START IN THE 1ST QTR AND THEN HAVE THEM MIX UP IN THE QTR AFTER.  THAT' WAY EVERYBODY IS HAPPY :):):)
latronchang::He seems to do well when there's no other "superstar" on the court.
Lorenzomax7::He seems to do well when there's no other "primary ball-handler" on the court.  FIFY
rEdBuLxTaSy::LIN'S LIKE A BALLBOY...HE DOES WHAT THE COACH TELLS HIM. IF HE CARRY WESTBRICK'S MENTALITY FROM NOW ON, I'M SURE HE COULD PULL 15 PPG / 8 AST :):):)
NguyenDragon::latronchang - He seems to do well when there's no other "superstar" on the court.  The problem with Harden is ball movement stops with him...
latronchang::Lin's shooting percentage is about to cross the .400 mark.  So what are the haters going to say when that happens?
latronchang::Yeah, but Kobe is in LA, and he would end up deferring to him.
NguyenDragon::I am sure D'Antoni would love to have him...
latronchang::Trade Lin to the Wizards where he can have full control of the court.
Tuoi56::I agree. Wizards sound good.   LIn will stat 22pts a night on average and will shut up the doubters.
Lorenzomax7::Lin should play like Westbrick mentally with his Linsane Style EVERY NIGHT.
rEdBuLxTaSy::LIN DID PLAY WITH A WESTBRICK MENTALITY IN THIS GAME AND THERE WERE 5 PLAYERS IN DOUBLE DIGITS.  THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE SPURS ARE A DEEP EXPERIENCED ROSTER THAT KNEW HOW TO CLOSE GAMES.:):):)  P.S. LIN SHOULD PLAY MORE LIKE THIS BUT IT'S HARD WITH HARDEN IN THE MIX.
rEdBuLxTaSy::MUCH OF IT HAS TO DO WITH COACH.  BEFORE THIS GAME, MCHALE STRESS ABOUT HAVING THE BALL IN LIN'S HAND MORE OFTEN THAN USUAL AND LOOKS LIKE THAT TURN OUT TO BE A GOOD THING.  HOPEFULLY THE COACH WILL CONTINUED TO BUILD HIS CONFIDENCE. :):):)
Lorenzomax7::Hopefully Harden will understand and respect that Lin got the All-Star potential to be a really good primary play-maker...and he will also benefit from that.
NguyenDragon::We already have Harden for that...
Lorenzomax7::Harden should play like Durant ! Period.
luckywin7::coach's need to wake up and work with LIN
luckywin7::FAITH!!!!!!!! LIN IT OKAY TO SHOOT THE BALL even harden alongside with you
WesTexSpur::The Thunder City Spurs went into OT with the Rockets? Hmm... ------------------------------------------------------------------------ OKC lost to SA and Memphis, what possible reason do you have to troll?
threetimechamp210::Lin had the ball taken away from Danny Green in the final seconds for a turnover by Lin. Spurs win, thats all that matters!
The Thunder City::The Spurs aren't worthy to hold the #1 spot.
Damasta959::but they have the number 1 spot nonetheless..... i think its more about someone being jealous
The Thunder City::Huh?
luckywin7::Reality check playoff spots #1 either spurs or memphis #2 either spurs or memphis #3 Thunders and will be out on playoff.....
luckywin7::thunder is out !!!!!spurs will be in #1 or # 2 spot so will tunder be # 3 but out
The Thunder City::Still....You don't make sense.
luckywin7::lin is 100% full defense!!!!!!!! in all his efforts of the season!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Thunder City::Spurs went into OT with the Rockets? Hmm...
shazzzam28::Actually, Houston was on fire that night.... they would have beat anyone in the NBA with the amount of threes they were making... including your Thunder.  So, I  think it was a great game for the Spurs.  Either way... I think Luckywin 7 is right.... Thunder will go far in playoffs but will not beat the Spurs this time without Harden. Thats a fact!
Damasta959::a win is a win, weird how that works right?
Seskatchewan::J. Lin: 38 pts, 3 Reb, 7 Ast, 2 Stl, 2 Blk. &gt;&gt;&gt; everyone saying Lin sucks
rtatrt::That's true, he does need to be more aggressive but he has to do it while controlling the tempo of the offense. He cannot do that by deferring to Harden and watching Harden throw up one bad shot after another.
rtatrt::Wrong, Lin needs to control the offense as he did with the Knicks last year in 24 out of 25 games. With Harden alongside, Lin simply gives Harden the ball as soon as they cross mid-court and gets out of his way. Lin is not a SG, his strength is running the team and getting his points within the framework of the offense.
luckywin7::yea your are also correct man lin gone soft or afraid of something, everybody fan  watching on lin star spot. He just need to be $@%!$@ aggressive and it OKAY TO SHOOT THE BALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
luckywin7::if harden wasnt ball hog and when lin wave for the ball. Just pass the damn ball in open field. There no problem for the rockets
luckywin7::i dont know just gotta have faith in lin and flow the rhythm. He would for sure score perfectly if everything is correct on the play
rma5690::If Lin would knock down his spot-up shots, he would get the ball more.
NguyenDragon::JLin can play... He just cant play with Harden... That being said Houston should trade JLin to a team with a system that allows him to play to his strength... This take the ball up, pass to Harden and wait at the 3 point line isn't going to work...
rtatrt::That was my argument. Lin needs to be the PG controlling the entire offense. When Harden is in the game, Harden dominates the ball so Lin takes a back seat. We saw what happened last night with Harden out of the lineup.
rtatrt::First, he comes up with numerous steals every game. Second, how many great PG's in the NBA don't play defense? Let's start with Steve Nash. Why do they always single out Lin?  I'm not saying Lin doesn't play defense because he's more than adequate.
DuaneXC::rma5690 - Lin's defense makes Nash look like Gary Peyton.  Really?  How many SPG is Nash producing?
rma5690::Lin's defense makes Nash look like Gary Peyton.
rtatrt::Those who are criticizing Lin so much really don't understand basketball. James Harden is the worst thing that could have happened to him. With Harden in the lineup, once Lin crosses mid-court he gives up the ball to Harden who throws up one bad shot after another.     With Harden out of the lineup, Lin runs/controls the offense and that's when he is at his best. Basketball is a team game and some guys like Lin, need the right circumstances to shine.
Lorenzomax7::+/- is one of the most dumb stats in the world and it is always overblown by idiots like the one above.
Crooklynism::You are accusing people of not understanding b-ball yet fail to mention his defense?  Let me check his +/- , hold please......oh yea, -4
luckywin7::amen
I Have The Pawaaaa::All last night Duncan had a look on his face that said "where's my couch?, I'm getting too old to chase these young guns."  I don't blame you dude, after all the millions you've made you deserve to enjoy your hard work.  You can even start a different career from the comfort of your couch!
Dawan208::He still has it though!
BearJWS::Yeah, dump marble mouth Shaq from TNT!  At least Tim we can understand Tim &amp; he sounds intelligent!
I Have The Pawaaaa::Duncan is reserved in words, but I would not be surprised to see him one day announcing or analyzing a game for TNT, ESPN, NBA or some other network.
LewsTherin10::Why is this posted on the espnnewyork site.  Nobody here cares about Jeremy Lin anymore.
Dawan208::And obvious he's gotten over y'all !!!!!!    Houston is a better city than that rat infested place!
Seskatchewan::Where are all the haters who made fun of Kevin Durant for making his first triple double a few weeks ago. Kevin is 7 years younger than Parker....
-mando-::Not in this room bro.  The Thunder didn't play in this game.
Seskatchewan::Different game, same situation
DuaneXC::The only ones who win in a game like this are fantasy owners...and the Spurs (LOL)
sa_spursfan20::Thank goodness the Spurs won last night. The amount of Linsanity talk by ESPN would have been awful.
woodylamb::Spurs are getting old and are seeing the end of the rainbow. Spurs have good coaching.
masongates87::Lin this, Lin that....the Spurs won! nobody cares bout that?? #overhyped #overrated #missingtheplayoffs
THE_Roen::38 pts, 2 TO......I guess he can score outside of D'Antoni's system.
DuaneXC::I hate to jump to conclusions after one game but, it's concerning that Lin looked this good w/o Harden against the best team they've faced.
Crooklynism::Seen Lin's Volvo commercial, are volvo's good cars? Im in the market for a new car, 25-$30K range
Stanley5826::Give the guy a break. It's probably his first car. Lol
Crooklynism::$30K first car?  Where you grow up?
I-Am-Captain-Obvious::This basketball discussion board seems like a good place for someone to get information about making an automobile purchase.
Crooklynism::Your statement is quite accurate, except that you assume I want information as oppose to an opinion, critical error on your part
rtatrt::Those who are criticizing Lin so much really don't understand basketball. James Harden is the worst thing that could have happened to him. With Harden in the lineup, once Lin crosses mid-court he gives up the ball to Harden who throws up one bad shot after another.   With Harden out of the lineup, Lin runs/controls the offense and that's when he is at his best. Basketball is a team game and some guys like Lin, need the right circumstances to shine.
rtatrt::I agree completely Docker. While watching Harden throw up one bad shot after another, I was wondering where was the head coach. Of course he was with his dying daughter so I cannot blame McHale.
rtatrt::Docker, good points but once again, I'm not comparing Harden with Lin because Lin is a PG while Harden is a SG. The issue is NOT who's better.   My argument is a back court of Lin and Harden doesn't seem to be working out very well. But it's still early in the season and hopefully that will change.
Docker2.o::You are not arguing right! More cussing and less reasoning! Kidding but you are right. Honestly, the only way I see this working is if Harden is out for a minute and we get Linsanity two. But with Harden in the lineup, management, including McHale have just handed the keys to Harden and said go. Lin has to show them and the world that Linsanity wasn't a fluke.
Docker2.o::No argument from me about Harden because he does take bad shots. But you have to blame coaching and not him. And the truth is, Lin still needs to adjust. Ask ANY GM in the league if they were starting a team, who'd they take Harden or Lin, 9 of them would pick Harden out of 10. Lin had to adjust to Melo, now he has to adjust to Harden. Great playersfnd a way to be effective regardless of who's on his team. Plus they will be teammates for the next 3 years so he had better adjust now.
rtatrt::I didn't say Lin is better than Harden because they're two completely different players. Lin is a fantastic young PG and Harden will be a terrific SG once he learns to get his points within the framework of the offense. Right now Harden takes far too many bad shots.
Docker2.o::Exactly! First it was Lin is better than Melo, now he's better than Harden. Lin needs to adjust but its these fanatics that go overboard which is why you get people rooting agaoni Lin. Their obsession is crazy and if anyone says anything about Lin, they are labeled racist. Really?
rma5690::This is why people hate linsanity. It attracts r.etards.
rtatrt::A rt is someone who is so dumb he cannot debate the issues and instead resorts to personally attacking others, thereby proving his complete ignorance of the issue at hand.
truthhurtsalot::Lin's attributes:  Ball-handling: 7/10 Court vision: 8.9/10 Passing: 8/10 Outside shooting: 6/10 Floater: 7.9/10 Bball IQ: 9/10 OTB defense: 6/10 Help defense: 7.9/10 Steals: 8.5/10 Rebounds for position: 8/10
Lorenzomax7::Rebounds for position: 9/10
Bigstevejw::Lol.
Kapangan Kid::LOL
FlyersFansRule::Math 10/10
truthhurtsalot::LOL
Bigstevejw::Lin is neither of what people make him out to be. He is obviously not trash and has some big game potential, but is nothing more than a slightly above average point guard. The guy is not a superstar or even a star. I think he is slightly overpaid (Should be 3-5 mil range) but nothing to the effect of Rashard Lewis or anything. He is also young and could get better. There are plenty of PG's in the league I would take over him (10-15) but his is definitely serviceable.
Paul Apoundstone::In my dozen plus years following sports on the webernets, I've never heard about a white  or black player being overpaid online. There's a clear disdain the swells beyond the idea of race and class that's evident in middle america's consciousness and its loathsomeness towards orientals. It's just society's way of saying, "Asians should just stay in school and keep doing hair/nails."
smurfwzhuo::He'll be a star, and a superstar.
SDevil3737::he is overpaid, but what $@%!$@% would turn down 25 mil? not a havard grad.
Tuoi56::Let him be the true PG for the Rockets and he will average 20pts a night.   25mil is modest in NBA. there are guys making 100millions dollars.
truthhurtsalot::Lin is right where he is and will be.  An above average point guard.  Not a superstar or star level, but certainly above average.
woodylamb::Lin is no average point guard. He is still developing. Let us say that he is a star potential.
BarrelRider04::Holy schnikes, SA with almost 8 dudes in double figures?? Did both of these teams agree not to play defense last night???
DuaneXC::This is the agreement everytime Houston plays, bro
RNYC::Great outlier game for Lin.   I think the fan boys just need to recognize the fact that the incessant hype and their overwhelming praise is the reason for people's backlash. When u come to this board and see fans like Tuoi and others blaming Harden for Lin's season long struggles, fans of the game get annoyed as that just shows a lack of intelligence and rational thinking. Harden is an elite player in this league, a piece to build around. Trust me if Lin can't adjust his game and work on things to complement Harden he will be the first to go.
Tuoi56::Let Harden sit down for the next game too.   LIn will stat 20pts a game. again.   Let LIN be the true PG for the Rockets and he proved already. His speed will dissect the defense and create foul shots. He had 12 foul shots alone.  He will penetrate and pass to center for dunk or dish out to the open man for 3.   Lin can hurt you in many way.   Accept the fact dude.
Dawan208::He's one person.  It's one opinion.
DuaneXC::It's also one game though I'm worried that Lin looked that good against the best competition in what has been a mediocre season thus far.
truthhurtsalot::Why would you expect Lin to be a star in this league? He's making $8m/year, what he's worth.  Stars in this league usually get paid $12m or more per year.   You people are acting like he's getting max money or $15m/year or something.  He would be the 4th-5th highest paid player on most teams...but he's definitely better than the 4-5th best player on most teams.  You people also need to realize that he's 23 years old.
Tuoi56::25million in NBA is modest. there are guys making over 100 million dollars.   LIN can stat 15pts a night easily. with the right environment.
RNYC::8 games don't translate into a 25mm contract and magazine covers. U can't possibly believe that. Underdog stories deserve press for sure but not national endorsements (Volvo) and magazine covers. Think about the press Lin gets vs the true star guards in this league. Guys who've done it for hundreds of games. That's what I'm referencing. The Jordan Crawford story is more about LBJ than Jordan Crawford    Why does it have to be hate. It's facts.
Dawan208::By the way Chinese people are buying more cars and they wanted jeremey to be the face of their ad.   They want to capitalize on that.   The commercial was to be aired in china.  I don't know why they show it here?  Maybe because of Asian Americans.   As more Asians get in the NBA from china maybe it won't be a big deal when they play good.
mkwan0::His deal is backloaded, so he will be making 14 mill in year three.  He received his 3 year, 25 mm contract after only 26 games.    He is a legit starter.  He has potential, though I personally think his potential is overstated.  I think his ceiling is at 'Solid starter, 3rd best player on team', which is certainly not bad, but not what people are making him out to be
truthhurtsalot::Solid starter, 3rd best player on team is DEFINITELY worth $8m/year in today's NBA.  3rd best player on team in today's NBA wants like $12m-$15m...
RNYC::26 games 7 really good don't normally translate into 25mm deals and numerous magazine covers. The endorsements and magazine covers are reserved for stars. Yet he is treated as such by the media so people look to his play on the court as evidence to back that contention.
Dawan208::Get over it.  And it was 3 magazines.  That's all!    He was rejected by many coming up and was passed up by schools.   His story is unique because he's not suppose to be big!   And yes there's interest because he's Asian .   Like Obama got attention when he became president!
truthhurtsalot::Those endorsements and magazine covers comes with every underdog story.    He had 8 really good games that were on a superstar level, not star level.  He not just won against STAR LEVEL PLAYERS, he dominated them and made them look bad.  That's how he got the attention.  When Jordan Crawford (at camp) dunked on LeBron James, he was the national media attention for weeks, made magazines and everything.  That's from one play...not a consecutive 8 game dominance at the highest level.  He made clutch game winners, a feat usually reserved for superstars.  If you set your hate aside, you'd see that his average stats shows that he's above par when compared to every other player in the league making $8m/year.
latronchang::Maybe Lin and Harden can split playing time.
DuaneXC::I think some people are ready to amnesty Harden after one game.  Though, it's worth looking into Lin coming off the Bench or vice versa.
Tuoi56::Washington Wizards.. LOL  easy win. haha
rEdBuLxTaSy::DON'T COUNT THEM OUT...THEY SLAUGHTER THE HEAT LAST WEEK :):):)
KobettaWorldBryant::Duncan is a ballhog chucker
wrduardo::Did you just casually say Duncan is better than Asik?
Tuoi56::Duncan is better than Asik though. Spurs scare me. But Knicks or Miami can beat them.
mkwan0::hey, I am sorry if my observations have been interpreted as hating.  I have been watching NBA for 20 years, and have seen these types of players time and again.  they usually have an early statistical explosion, followed up by a decline.  Whether they climb out of that decline is up to them.  Based on my observations of Lin, he just doesn't look to me like the type of player who will be  a star in this league.  Just my opinion, as I obviously can't see the future.  But it happens every year.  Sorry
truthhurtsalot::Why would you expect Lin to be a star in this league?  He's making $8m/year, what he's worth.  Stars in this league usually get paid $12m or more per year.
Tuoi56::Sir, you do now know how to analyze in your 20years of watching the NBA.   I am sure you do now know why LIN scored 38pts tonight and will wonder, he just had a good lucky one day of a game.
Tuoi56::you do not i mean
rEdBuLxTaSy::NOBODY IS PERFECT OR CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE. IF YOU THINK LIN WILL BE AN AVERAGE PG, THAT'S FINE BUT REMEMBER THAT'S JUST YOUR OPINION.  WE CAN AGREED TO BEING DISAGREEABLE.  ALSO, MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS I'VE COME ACROSS WILL ONLY FOCUS ON THE NEGATIVE AND NOT THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF HIS GAME.  THAT'S HOW I KNOW THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING LIN IMPROVE AND WILL DO OR SAY ANYTHING TO JUSTIFY THEIR ILL-CONCEIVED JUDGEMENT.  NOT SAYING YOU'RE LIKE THAT THOUGH. :):):)
springfresh3.1::yeah and the rest of you who microscope individuals like Lin are sad sad people, enjoy the game and stop wasting time on putting down someone that made it in the NBA
Tuoi56::LIn can easily stat 15pts a night by pick and roll alone.   IT's obvious.
Roy3667::I have Parker and Duncan on my fantasy team and I'm 6-0!
woopzzzz::mkwan0 -  he is turnover prone and an average passer or shooter.   this scrub mkwan lost all little shred of credibility when he said jlin is "turnover prone". lin scored 38 tonight and only 2 turnovers. he's been averaging 2-3 turnovers a game, some games 0-1 turnovers, a big improvement from last season. harden's been averaging 5-6 turnovers yet nobody calls him turnover prone. he's just an illogical jealous lin hater. not worth the time to talk to people like this.
RNYC::U need to check the stat line. The numbers u quote for harden are way off.
I Have The Pawaaaa::mkwan0 keeps saying he can see the future.  No doubt all credibility is lost from that point forward.
springfresh3.1::Thats because they dont watch games, they just remember his stint in NY.....hating is too easy
rEdBuLxTaSy::EXACTLY MOST OBSESSED LIN HATERS HAVE LOW READING COMPREHENSION SKILLS AND WILL USED WHAT THEY SEE OR HEAR FROM THE CRITICS TO JUSTIFY THEIR ARGUMENT INSTEAD OF DOING THEIR OWN RESEARCH FIRST.
woopzzzz::they like to harp on the negatives of history even tho we are living in the present and the negatives have already been improvised to positives.
Tuoi56::Sometimes LIN's precise pass to center or penetrating and then dishing out for a dunk amazes me.   His court vision is like wow.... does he have eyes on the back????
woopzzzz::mkwan has no eyes either on the front of his head or back cuz he still sees jlin's fictional high turnovers.
ardaleviel::Goooo spurs 18-4, jajajajaja haters
woopzzzz::i'd rather trust the predictions of an elite player like tony parker about jlin's career over a non-nba scrub like mkwan:  http://blog.chron.com/ultimaterockets/2012/12/tony-parker-sees-similarites-with-lin-at-same-stage-of-career/
mkwan0::For every player that followed TP's career arc, there were many, many more who failed.  Do not mistake Parker's graciousness for an ironclad guarantee that the two players will follow the exact same arc.  If I spent ten minutes, I could find a dozen players with better first 82 games numbers than Lin (and TP) who failed.
springfresh3.1::You probably would spend half a day trying to find people better than Lin..your life is awesome
WOOPZZZ::other players - especially young players with less than 1 season full of nba games played - are allowed to grow and develop and improve their skillsets and strive for their potential. but according to people like mkwan, lin has already reached his potential and isnt expected to improve anymore and is doomed to be "average". sorry, but i'd rather take tony parker's predictions about jlin over a non-nba player like mkwan:  http://blog.chron.com/ultimaterockets/2012/12/tony-parker-sees-similarites-with-lin-at-same-stage-of-career/
houstonvirus::booooooooooooo
gmskking::Getting all their wins out of the way now before the playoffs...
sa_spursfan20::Says a Laker fan whose team may not even make the playoffs. LOL
mkwan0::Hey, I will take another run to the WCF's any day.  Prefer the finals, but to dismiss the WCF's as not being the playoffs just makes you look bitter

I Have The Pawaaaa::Before last night's game, Tony Parker said Jeremy is on the same path that Tony was on in his first 82 games in terms of personal stats.  While it was a nice complement from Tony, the younger Tony also never faced the kind of fierce competitors in the sport today from the likes of LeBron, Kobe, Durant, Rose, Rondo.
spurs_4_5::10 years ago when spurs had to go against prime kobe-shaq lakers, sacramento, and dallas teams? and half the players you mentioned lin would have to go through are playing in east
mkwan0::Are you really arguing that the league is significantly tougher today than it was 10 years ago?
truthhurtsalot::It is tougher today than 10 years ago.  The early 2000s were the soft and easy years.  Not 20 years ago though...
rEdBuLxTaSy::EXACTLY!!! I DON'T EVER THINK SINCE LINSANITY, LIN CAN GO ONTO THE COURT NOT FEELING PRESSURE FROM THE DELUSIONAL OBSESSED HATERS AND PLAYERS WHO PUT A TARGET ON HIS BACK TO MAKE SURE HE FAILS JUST TO MAKE A POINT.  THEN YOU HAVE THE MEDIA AND BIASED WRITERS ALL OVER HIM ON A DAILY BASIS?  HOW IN THE WORLD IS THE KID SUPPOSED TO LEARN AND GROW NORMALLY IN A LEAGUE FULL OF BONEHEADS? :):):)
I Have The Pawaaaa::Jeremy will figure it out.  He didn't get a 3.1 from Harvard without getting a few A's to push his grade point average above 3.0.
WOOPZZZ::and parker said this BEFORE last night's game! when everyone was really worried about lin's shooting slump
mkwan0::Lost in all this Lin talk is the fact that hey, the Spurs won another one, and still have the best record in the league
Tuoi56::Too bad, you and other writers want him to be an average player. But he had skills along and showed against Spurs tonight.   LIn actually got faster than when he was with the NY. His penetration to the basket got faster and he now can criss cross and go from one direction to the other and drive to the basket and create foul shots. He had 12foul shots alone.  He can also dish out to the open man or penetrate and pass to the center for a dunk.   With the opportunity to play a true PG. you saw what LIN can do. He can easily stat 15pts a night. But with Harden ball hogging most of the game. that is not happening.   Do some analyzation with reasonings to back up. without just blurring, "he sucks, he's average." like the stupid writers.
rEdBuLxTaSy::IT'S FINE IF YOU DON'T BELIEVED HE DESERVED THE CONTRACT BUT WHAT'S DONE IS DONE AND SURELY SOMEONE BELIEVED IN THE KID SO IT'S BEST IF ALL THE CRITICS JUST GIVE HIM SOME ROOM TO BREATH AND GROW.  FOR GOD'S SAKE, 90% OF THE LEAGUE PLAYERS ARE BUMS BUT THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE SAME KIND OF TREATMENT IS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LIN.
mkwan0::It is curious that you talk about this being a showcase of him playing 'true' point guard.  He took 21 shots, the most on his team, and scored 38 points.  These are not point guard numbers.  These are the numbers of a primary ball handler calling his own shot.    To be clear, my stance is not that Lin sucks, but that he will likely average 15 ppg and 5 apg...pretty average.  He belongs in the league, but does not deserve the contract he has or the hype that followed his 26 games.  Rockets overpaid for him, there is little question
rEdBuLxTaSy::MOST CRITICS WILL SAY ANYTHING TO JUSTIFY THEIR NEAR-SIGHTED VISION AND CLAIM IT AS FACTS :):):)
WOOPZZZ::spurs is an elite team. better to lose to an elite team than a scrub team. tony parker complimented lin and said he's very similar to when he was a 3rd year player too.  http://blog.chron.com/ultimaterockets/2012/12/tony-parker-sees-similarites-with-lin-at-same-stage-of-career/
mkwan0::Lin is an average starting guard at best.  His ball handling is only average, and his court vision is average.  If teams play him to score, he becomes a non-factor.  This is not bad for an undrafted player, but this guy is not worth the contract or his hype.
Tuoi56::You saw what LIN can do with the given opportunity to play a true PG.   LIN actually got faster than when he was with the NY. His penetration to the basket got faster and he now can even criss cross to dissect the defender and penetrate the basket and create the foul shots. He alone has 12 pts foul shots.  Lin's got awesome court vision. He can penetrate and pass to the open man for a 3 pointer or drive to the basket and dish out to Parsons or Asik for a dunk. His passes are precisely delivered to the center for a dunk.  LIN can easily average 15pts a game give an opportunity to handle the ball. But right now that is not happening with Harden ball hogging scoring most of the time.   Analyze before and back up your reasonings. otherwise it's just a blurr like the stupid writers.
houstonvirus::lin is not good
rEdBuLxTaSy::PERHAPS ALOT OF PEOPLE DOESN'T BELIEVED LIN DESERVED THE CONTRACT OR BELIEVED IN THE HYPE AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.  BUT TO CALL HIM A SCRUB IS ANOTHER, CONSIDERING THIS IS HIS FIRST FULL SEASON AS A STARTER.  PARKER DIDN'T PLAY TOO GREAT AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER AND LOOK AT HIM NOW.:):):)
rEdBuLxTaSy::CLAIMING LIN IS A 1 HIT WONDER AFTER 80+ GAMES SHOWS YOU'RE NOT TOO BRIGHT EITHER.  MOST LIN CRITICS ARE JUST SO CONFIDENT IN THEIR JUDGEMENT, IT'S RIDICULOUS!!! :):):)
mkwan0::rEdBuLxTaSy - NAW JUST USING THE WORDS OF THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS.  I THINK I INTERPRET IT PRETTY WELL.:):):)  OK, then please do not respond to me if you are going to put words into my mouth.  You are doing a disservice to anyone who is trying to seriously represent the Rockets or Lin.  There is a reason why people think you are an idiot.
rEdBuLxTaSy::NAW JUST USING THE WORDS OF THE OBSESSED LIN HATERS.  I THINK I INTERPRET IT PRETTY WELL.:):):)
mkwan0::You interpret average starting guard as 'scrub'????  Maybe you need to get a little thicker skin
WOOPZZZ::uh-huh...he sure played average against the elite spurs. he should keep playing average then. i think that would make the rockets happy.
rEdBuLxTaSy::SO I COULD PREDICT JUST BY YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU WON'T GO FAR IN LIFE BECAUSE YOU LACK OPTIMISM AND AMBITION?  IS THAT FAIR???  SERIOUSLY THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE CRITICS ARE DOING AT THIS POINT :):):)
mkwan0::WOOPZZZ - and you know for a fact that lin will only be a one hit wonder huh? guess you can predict the future. how much do you charge for psychic reading, btw??  No, but looking at his skill set, physical tools, etc, it is possible to make a prediction, which is all anyone can do.  He is a slight, not particularily strong or fast guard with good height.  he is turnover prone and an average passer or shooter.  It is possible that he can develope his game, probably that he won't.  For every Tony Parker that succeeds, there are several others that fail (TP was the fourth PG taken in his draft, and the only one successful).  No one can predict the future, but I would expect him to be averaging about 15 and 6 at most by this time two years from now.
rEdBuLxTaSy::I'M NOT INSISTING THAT WON'T BE THE CASE BUT YOU CAN'T' REALLY SAY OH HE'S AVERAGE AFTER JUST 1 SEASON EITHER.  SERIOUSLY PEOPLE NEEDS TO STOP BEING SELECTIVE AND RESERVED THEIR JUDGEMENT UNTIL THE GAME IS OVER.
WOOPZZZ::and you know for a fact that lin will only be a one hit wonder huh? guess you can predict the future. how much do you charge for psychic reading, btw??
mkwan0::rEdBuLxTaSy - ANYTIME LIN HAS A GOOD GAME, HIS CRITICS WILL USED THE WORD "AVERAGE" TO DOWNPLAY HIS POTENTIAL.  IT'S FUNNY HOW THEY CAN PREDICT LIN'S CAREER IN JUST A SPAN OF 80+ GAMES LOL :):):)  And you aren't doing the same?    Look at his skills, his jumper, etc.  The league is full of one year wonders, guys who average 20 ppg for one season and then are never significant again.  Stop buying into the hype
mkwan0::Are you familiar with Sleepy Floyd.  Don't look at outliers and try to define the curve with them
