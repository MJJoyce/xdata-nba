B::Poor shooting by the Pistons. They had 16 more shots but made 1 less than the Hawks. The other thing was home cooking officiating by the refs. 12 more free throws by the Hawks. Pistons are still trying to find out who they are as a team and who are their outside scorers. Until that happens they will struggle to be at .500. The good news for them is that they only had two starters go off in a game like this and lost by 8. They can beat this team later on if they play better.
Bobbyk::Fantasy owners that have Jennings are probably happy.However as I`ve said before keep Jennings shots under 15 Atts and you should have a win.This team is clueless.
__A_YAHOO_USER__::Surprising you could find any combination of stats that James doesn't dominate.
Cyril::Teague +9, Jennings -13.   I think Jeff just reminded Brandon that MIlwaukee tried to sign him first.
George::Brandon Jennings......You Suck!! 21points on 21 shots.. your a scrub.
KEITH::Smith and Jennings keep firing up bad shots, Hawks love ya.
dc::Good win.  Smoove was the same as always...launching junk shots.  Go Hawks.
Voice of Lost Generation::To Detroit:  Enjoy Jennings. He flys around and shoots stupid shots. Point guard mentality of shoot first and pass later.   From Milwaukee
Johnathan::Looks like Josh Smith hasn't learned his lesson...still chucking up those long bricks from the 3-pt. arc.  Good riddance, Josh.
Matheus::Why jennings don't stop shooting?
