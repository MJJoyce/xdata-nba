Bottoms Up::Just think we could've had both Curry and Lawson and we would probably have been in the running for a championship instead Kahn picks Flynn and then trades Lawson.  I was so pissesd when they traded away Lawson and not draft Curry.  Now we don't have a first round pick next year unless we are in the lottery?
raymond::because rubio is such a bad shot they had to sit him at end of clevland game. just another wasted 1st rd pick by f up kahn
Mr_Mojo Risin::All I have read is the Warriors have no defense. Warriors will not get far in the playoffs because all they do is rely on the 3. I can see how one would naturally assume these false assumptions based on previous history if they have never actually watched the Warriors play. If not for a little home cooking (ESPECIALLY at the end of the 3rd qtr) the W's would be up by 20 now. Yes, the game is FAR from over (DUBS 89-80 as I type this) but the Warriors have done this strictly on defense and without the 3 ball.
C.Jin::Damn look at Iggy go, hes such an important presence on the court and hes doing well with this starting lineup of scorers. I absolutely love this Warriors team.
Dan::This should be a great tilt. Lots of people say there are only a handful of good teams in the NBA. I       couldn't disagree more. These two teams were once at the bottom put could very well be contenders when all is said and done. Go Wolves!
mark::I'm surprized Ognjen Kuzmic and Nemanja Nedovic did'nt score? I start them both on my fantasy team.
brian::why is there a woman ref?
YimingF::Damn you Ricky Rubio!!! Harry Potter had to injured Curry and still the timberpups still lost. As a Warriors fan, I lost respect for him. Wassup with refs trying to fixed the game for t-wolves and still lost... This was trap game and we still won.....
- LJ::is Stephen Curry in the game?
Dragon::i really hope steph curry is ok, the warriors badly need a backup PG; toney douglas cannot run an offense.
