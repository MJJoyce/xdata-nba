Michael::The Jazz only lost because Trey Burke didn't play in this game!!!  That's the only reason they ever lose games now!  Wait, he played?  Oh, wow.  Oh boy.  Rubio got 15 more assists over these 2 games and committed 2 LESS turnovers?  Home and home beatdown.  Burke watched his team get blown out twice and did nothing to stop it?  Yeesh, you'd think people would take this opportunity to re-evaluate their infatuation with him.  Sadly, they won't.  He's a nice player.  So is Darren Collison.  Where was the outrage in 2009 when people passed on Darren Collison?  And so the unnecessary Trey Burke lovefest marches on!  Newsflash: This guy isn't Magic Johnson (who actually WAS impressive in his rookie season).  He isn't going to add 15+ wins to his team's win total for his rookie season like LeBron or Wade did.  Just shut up already with this idea that those that passed on him are morons for doing so.  Just accept that this year's draft class was historically weak and you can easily find at least a dozen players in the NBA today who can do what he does at the point.
C.N.S.::Enes Kanter only plays 20 minutes in a game where Derick Favors sits with an injury?  #$%$ Ty Corbin?
David::Kevin Love throws one mean outlet pass.  I wonder if he every played any QB
Baseballcardassassin::Gordon Hayward is playing like an all-star and he deserves to make the west squad as a reserve.
