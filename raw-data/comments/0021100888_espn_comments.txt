Rob Parker is a black skip bayless::" I am supposedly a good defender and a point guard and i got my ankle's broken by deshawn Stevenson "  - <i>Rajon Rondo</i>
Dribbird::Lebron is supposedly a good offensive player, but he can be covered by Rondo.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V2tcKdNUL0
iamatightend::you mad bro? take the loss
Road dog Red::so during halftime i leave the crib...and head to my local lizard lounge to lubricate the painof it all...and heck....if i drink hard enough ..even if the LOSE to these D-leagurs in Raptons uniforms...the TV will be so blurry by then i won't be able to see it.  At the lizard lounge the catfish are mating mode...they are going after every bit of bait in the joint...free rounds are coming from every direction. and its a good thing cuz the Tics are an embarrassment to TV...shoot the DANG ball Rondo cuz NOBODY is guarding you...its a lost cause.. i'm screaming a TV in a bar with a live band staring at me like i'm their lead singer.. \or the shame of it all...and no i don't mean me...i mean watching the Celtics pooped in their depends and liking it... \well after a few rounds the catfish moved in on me and it was a long night and day and night... i just got home this morning, a couple of hundred dollars lighter,  catfish bite marks all over my body, and bad/good memories involving an aging cougar and her more than willing best friend.  Lesson learned....Its the Celtics/Rondo FAULT...and I hate Toronto..and will for he rest of my life
Dribbird::Rest all the starters tonight vs the Bobkittens.
StompYourFace25::That would be dumb, we almost lost to them when all of the starters were playing... I say no.
Dribbird::It's the third night of a back to back to back and the playoffs are right around the corner. I'd rather everyone be healthy than try against the Bobcats.
jbarnes1621::I am all for this.........if they still win.  We need as many as we can if we want home court in the first round.
CJ_PATRIOT_FAN::That Bass for Glen Davis trade looks better every game.
Rand0687::I was sold after the first game when he shot like 70%
Road dog Red::THIS WAS LIKE THE LOST WEEKEND...so i'm at home Friday watching the the Tics horrify the paying public by playing merry go round with a bunch of bench players and D-leaguers with Torontyo Raptors uniforms on... The Celts are performing with the intensity of a sleeping drunk pissing himself...i can feel myself getting sick.....Hey Doc..sit rondos rectangular knucklehead DOWN if he ain't going to shoot a LAYUP..why is he making everything easy SO HARD huh..i mean what so WRONG about shooting a 3ft shot. Hey  Rajon...why do you have to whip sum stupid pass to an unguarded player for a 25ft jumpshot...so you can keep yer double assist streak going....that is so selfish..bet you were the guy who didn't like sharing his Captain Crunch with his cousins...it has to be about YOU...screw the team...its about YOU.. \Memo to Rondo...Play sum freaking DEFENSE and you are given a 3-4 foot shot...TAKE IT you freaking MOron
oreed luv his redsox::im so happy for Gerald Green..he had a tough career...i sure doc was proud of him last night amazing game
Road dog Red::just coming back to life after drinking myself into a STUPOR after the raptors game...so \the Tics won this one eh...did Rondo looked like sheet again.....did he take a freaking shot in this one..or did what he did in Toronto...get  wide open layup lanes...AND PASS THE BALL TO SOMEONE 20 FT OUT FOR A JUMPSHOT
damn334::paul pierce and kevin garnet after the win http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF4QyjJNuXo&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL
Road dog Red::ummmm.........NO
nba is the worst::So can the Celtics somehow manage to beat the Bobcats on the road?  Will Rondo make a ft?
oreed luv his redsox::if anyone knows rondo he could score when he wants.. theirs 6 guys on that team that  could score..rondo job is to make life easy for everyone.....i'll take rondo over rose any day.......rose ballhog &amp; shoot to many dumb 3s when he has guys on his team that could shoot...
BoilerPacers3::hey ESPN, Boston's still 3 games back of Indy.  Just letting you guys know.
scottthomas1965::I started betting on sports last year and tried a few pros for picks and never had any real luck. I stumbled upon a sports betting system called sportsbettingstar.com a few months ago. It is a 2 game betting system but I have won more money using this system than any other system I have tried so far. I am making the income of a part time job now just following this system. Thought I would share this if anyone out there is trying to find a betting system that actually works

Authentic Pyrrhic Remission::Is it true
Lance Q::I see the Knicks getting swept by the Heat. I prefer if the Celtics meet the Bulls.
jdzspace.::Paul Pierce SUCKS in the clutch. . . . . . HUGE one.
Chocolate Thunder.::Orioles vs. Mets in the World Series.
Authentic Pyrrhic Remission::Go O's!!
scam_alert::O
Rondo is a Bum::Yes
Rondo is a Bum::Rondo is a bum
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::PP is a bi  .tch
jdzspace.::Pierce is dog poop in the clutch
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Die via a stab wound. JK. I am. Have a good night.
Rondo is a Bum::Go to bed dammit.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Time for a bowl and sleep. Have a great night C's fans.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Anyone notice how Simmons never gives Rondo his respect?
Chocolate Thunder.::Fuck Simmons
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::I liked Wednesday's article.
Chocolate Thunder.::I read them.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::I can't help it. His articles are interesting. Still think he is a full fledged Clipper fan at this point.
ChosenOneBoston::Celtics will win tomorrow. Dueces!
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::The Bobcats are going to be tough tomorrow...
jdzspace.::any team that is on 3rd game on the 3rd night would be tough. that is a given
Chocolate Thunder.::As bizarre as that sounds, its true.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::You are as bad as Bill Simmons jinxing the team.
jdzspace.::i'm going to go and get ready for bed, have to be at work in 9.5hours. . . yippie.   good game C's. .. Pierce is trash in the clutch.   Rondo for MVP  that is all
Chocolate Thunder.::Say hi to your mom
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Have a good sleep.
KeithDTN::I am a true Heat fan... loved them since their inception in 1988 when they came into the league.  Been through the good years with Alonzo, and Hardaway in the late 90s... and grew to hate the Knickerbockers for putting us out of the playoffs every year... then the title in 2006 was sweet... I must say the Celtics scare me this year.. they are playing better than ever now.. I would not be shocked if they won the East this year
NathanZiggy10::Does my eyes deceive me? An actual Heat fan that knows it's history? And not trolling? Just saying that I'm surprised because for years, I've been  coming to these boards, (mostly while at work he,he) and Heat fans were virtually non-existent prior to 2010. Then the band wagoners showed up and redefined the meaning of troll. Just glad to see a fan here and talk sports. You're OK in my book.
KeithDTN::No bro, some Heat fans are actually pretty cool.  I hate all the bandwagon people.  Good and bad for someone like LeBron coming ro Miami.  Since he announced he was coming, it's been like a circle like armosphere.
KeithDTN::Celtics are a good team
Chocolate Thunder.::I agree, im just surprised to hear a Heat fan make a claim like that. But then again, you seem to be a genuine Heat fan and not a bandwagon loser.
KeithDTN::the $@%!?
Chocolate Thunder.::the fuck?
Rondo is a Bum::Most important players on the C's right now  1. PP 2. KG 3. Bass 4. Ray 5. Avery 6. Pietrus 7. Steamer 8. Sasha 9. Keyon 10. Quis 11. Hollins 12. The Mascot 13. Doc 14. Tommy 15. Rajon
iamatightend::DOC rondo, kg, pierce, bass, bradley, ray, steamer, pietrus, moore, johnson, sasha, keyon, hollins, quis, a few random guys.....little bit further...Jermaine o neal
Shaun0088::Either you are bored or you really love trolling.I think you love trolling have a goodnight kid.
ChosenOneBoston::If rondo saw this he would break your elbow
J-SMOOVE2058::i despise kg, but he has ALWAYS been the most important player on the team.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Have to agree Smoove except for the despise part.
jdzspace.::well i just finished watching the game. . . .good win by the C's. now we just have to do it again tomorrow!!
J-SMOOVE2058::LIKE THIS COMMENT IF YOU THINK IT WAS A BAD JOKE THAT LUOL DENG MADE THE ALL STAR GAME THIS YEAR.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Replace Deng with Johnson and you will get a LIKE
Chocolate Thunder.::Paul Pierce is a great Celtic and a sure fire HOF.
ChosenOneBoston::Pierce is a hall of famer. He has more career pts then bird and 10 all star appearences not to mention finals mvp
jdzspace.::I will concede that Paul Pierce is a Celtic. . . . . that is all
jdzspace.::but he wouldn't be even made to look like a "great Celtic" if not for Rondo. so i can't really give him the nod.   he's nothing without Rondo
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Edit: Rondo
Chocolate Thunder.::Agree, but Rondo is better.
jdzspace.::like i said, he is a Celtic
J-SMOOVE2058::Bulls refused to trade Deng for Kobe in 2007.  WOW!!!!!!!!!!!
ChosenOneBoston::i dont believe that one bit
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Good decision.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Thanks Smoove.
J-SMOOVE2058::well then u are mentally ill
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::I am.
J-SMOOVE2058::u cant be serious.
Rondo is a Bum::I'm fkng mad right now.
Chocolate Thunder.::lol
jdzspace.::I would be mad too if the player i liked was such a mark as.s b.tch in the cluth like Pierce
Chocolate Thunder.::Well he did...not sure about now, after that Sixers game..haha
Rondo is a Bum::Jd  Shut the $@% up about PP. No one is perfect. At least he can shoot the ball unlike Rondo.
jdzspace.::who is asking for perfection? how about make a clutch shot more than ONCE A YEAR.   is that reasonable? how about it?
Chocolate Thunder.::Rondo shoots a better % from 16-23 feet than doughboy does.
MettaWorldJoke::C's will have to play Chicago if the standings stay, they are prolly better off playing Miami?
ChosenOneBoston::Every team is better off playing mia
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::depends which Miami shows up.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::I really don't know at this point. Both will be a tough series. I prefer the C's play the Bulls.
Chocolate Thunder.::That reminds me, Sox in last place, Orioles in first.  Chew on that.
jdzspace.::are you lost?   do you not know where you are?
Chocolate Thunder.::I have never watched a Hockey game in my life.
jdzspace.::least favorite sport. . . . . not counting hockey, since hockey isn't a sport
Chocolate Thunder.::You dont like baseball do you?
jdzspace.::mom's not a big baseball fan. . . .you gotta work on your pillow talk bro
Chocolate Thunder.::Im on top of your mom.
Chocolate Thunder.::I watched the Orioles game last night instead. I had a bad feeling about last nights game.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::You called it.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::You kind of did. You said don't think this is a gimme in so many words.
Chocolate Thunder.::I didnt really call it, but i was not confident.
J-SMOOVE2058::seriously, orlando would be better off not making the playoffs.  miami and chicago would throttle them.  the pacers would beat em up too.  it is gonna get really ugly for orlando fast if dwight cant go.
ChosenOneBoston::U mad bro
ChosenOneBoston::And the hawks want to get rid of you as their fan
J-SMOOVE2058::sure they do jacka$$
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Real question. Do you like Joe Johnson?
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Of course. he is a waste. I like Horford, Smith and the others. I just think Johnson is a bit overrated.
J-SMOOVE2058::yeah.  the player i want to get rid of is marvin williams.
jdzspace.::Pierce acted like a constipated narwhal in heat in the clutch pis.sed me off last night
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::His last shot was atrocious.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Rondo would have had a better shot.
jdzspace.::JJ had a better chance
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::I know he was out. KG had a better shot of hitting the 3
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Allen would have made that shot. Rivers should only make plays for Allen with less then 10 seconds.
jdzspace.::his entire trash game in the clutch is. . . . well trash
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Peaches p'd me off last night.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::All the c's made me mad yesterday.

UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Seriously, where is Corn Nuts? He is funny.
scam_alert::I WILL TELL YOU THIS MARSHON BROOKS OVER BROOK LOPEZ
scam_alert::NEW JERSEY FAILS. DWILL IS GONE
MettaWorldJoke::Jsmoove why did you say (in another room) that the Magic should loose every game if Howard is out?  If they did that then they would be playing Miami or Chicago.
J-SMOOVE2058::well, i thought maybe there was a chance they could miss the playoffs.  but there isnt.  so they should hold onto the 6 seed.
MettaWorldJoke::yeh
jdzspace.::he's scared of New York
J-SMOOVE2058::No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit in an nba playoff series.  i wonder if it will ever happen.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::It will.
Chocolate Thunder.::Bradley will start in the playoffs whether Ray is 100% or not.
jdzspace.::we'll see about that
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::J-Smoove, when the Hawks play the Heat, who do you root for?
ChosenOneBoston::Y'all wont get past boston. Y'all never have and never will
ChosenOneBoston::K whatever helps u get over the fact that we own yall
J-SMOOVE2058::Hawks beat Boston in the 1958 NBA Finals.
J-SMOOVE2058::um, Hawks
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Not being rude.
UK_Basketball_for_Life1::Honestly, I feel like I see you defend the Heat more.
MettaWorldJoke::Whoever wins
