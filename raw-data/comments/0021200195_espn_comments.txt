TresMilagro::Oh, oh, oh, it's Magic!
Oscar Robertson::I voted for President Barack Obama. I support him 100%.   This year, I will vote for Rajon Rondo, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Lebron James, and Jason Terry to be the starters for the east in the All-Stars game in Houston.
Telkalynn3013::The Magic are nobody's homecoming game.  They've lost four games by nine points or less and bring it almost every night.  I'm going to keep saying it, in two years with a lottery pick or two and this young core of ballers, they are going to be NICE!
alexj26602::f.uck the championships this year............. all i need is the heats $@% in in the playoffs
Dan0934::Once the C's tighten up their defense a little bit, they will be a dam tough team to beat.
Heinrich.Himmler::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaOJMjWPagc
Canyoudunk86::The Magic are holding up fairly well considering the lost of Dwight Howard. J.J. is looking like he's back at Duke
_I Am A Celtic_::C's!
nba is the worst::Good game for Rondo but those bricks at the end almost cost the C's the win.  Magic have some good young players, but Glen Davis should never be shooting threes in crunch time.
Excelscior1::He was due a mediocre shooting day from distance. Give the guy a break. Plus, they won and wouldn't have won with out him.
Truth-Big Ticket-FedEx-Jet::Glen Davis was releasing his inner Andrew Bynum :)
Truth-Big Ticket-FedEx-Jet::RONDOOOOOOOOOOO!! :)
ThatsGoodSoup7963::Awesome. Way to go, two good wins in two great, exciting games. Go CELTICS.
KYRIEALLTHEWAY::YAY BOSTON WON
gstolls1967::I started playing an online bet system called Sportsbettingstar. Since I started I have made an average profit of $3,000 a month. I hope that this reaches someone that is looking for an online betting system that really works well. I found this system on the 1st page of Google by searching the  words Sports Betting System.
