omahalightning14::wow did anyone else see that the heat didn't play anyone because they don't care about the 1seed? they know they can beat the bulls in a 4 game series so it doesn't matter. seeding is a very unimportant thing in the playoffs, giving the big 3 a break especially after lebron only missing 1 game this year was a good decision in my opinion.
Hoo186::Wow...it's amazing that the Wizards are showing more heart than Miami...actually, it's not at all amazing, Heat have never had heart.
omahalightning14::Uhhhh, how do they not have heart when they didn't even play their Big 3.  Moron
Sandmanthegreatest::The Heat will be swept in the first round by the Knicks.
omahalightning14::Yeah, not happening
tfec2233::I'm shocked a team that hasn't won anything can just look at playoff seeding as pointless.  The great dynasties of the Lakers and Celtics and Bulls never had this mentality.  But I'm really not surprised.
jared575757::so you are shocked, and not surprised at the same time
GetEmJov::D Wade just cant stay healthy for anything this year, Good thing the injury was not on his shooting hand.
MudRunnerVA::The move to not play James and Bosh, and ultimately Wade after injury, made sense. In order to leap the Bulls, the Bulls would have to lose to an Eastern opponent and the Pacers are now playing their C Team since they can't move up or down from the 3 seed. Plus, I am not concerned at all with Miami playing in Chicago....if Chicago even makes it that far.
YHM226::Quite frankly 2 B honest with you.....the only team I C beating the bulls in the play-offs R the heat.....If we win the number 1 seed I don't care what you're talking about!!!......WE'LL WIN THE E.C.F CHAMPIONSHIP!!!!.............Thus destroying whoever s in the overrated west!!!If we win the number 2 seed&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WE MAY LOSE TO YOU!!!.....SO TALK WHAT U WANT!!!Number 1 seed bulls wins it all!!!!......number 2 seed TROUBLE!!!!And not from any other team.......JUST the heat!!!!.......We get that 1 seed....You HEARD IT HERE 1st....GOOOOOOO BULLSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
omahalightning14::i remember all the bulls talking bull like this last year when they won the 1 seed. you better hope the best player in the league doesn't score if you want to get by the heat.
YHM226::R U SERIOUS?
MudRunnerVA::yes
lebronandjeterballerz::I agree. Shut down chicago's three point shooting and anyone can beat them
YHM226::ahhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa!!!!.....The knicks about to destroy you bitchz!!!GOOOOOO BULLSSSSSS!!!!
MudRunnerVA::Still angry about last years playoff's departure??
YHM226::hahaaaaaa!.....nice!!
MudRunnerVA::Nope. Shutting up the C's and Bulls did it for me.
YHM226::R U?
zerkcs::didnt the bulls lose to the wizards not too long ago, with their starting lineup minus rose?
zerkcs::You said go Bulls on a message board of the Heat Wizards game. What else would I think of? Way to revert to second grade name calling by the way.
lebronandjeterballerz::knicks are overrated
YHM226::I said KNICKS not WIZARDS!!!....Im not calling you stupid Im just saying you have no luck when it comes to thinking.
El Cabezon 1::Word is that Wade broke a nail and is out for 3 weeks?
zerkcs::better than that yeast infection that rose has been battling all season
BigCas3232::I'm not going to cry about it. I'm just going to use it as an excuse in the playoffs. Every year I have to have some injury to play up during playoff time. D Wade
ChitownSuperBowlBound::Miami fans should consider themselves lucky that injuries haven't hurt James/Wade/Bosh for the most part.  This finger is a non-issue.  Take James away from the heat for 25-26 games and they would be 4-6 seed in the East.
not1not2not3not4not5not6not7not8....0::Miami probably would of had the best record this year if Wade sat out the entire season...Why is this a headliner?? This does about as much damage to the Heat, as if Scalabrine stubbed his toe on the Bulls.
You cant stop the Sanchize::espn had to disclaim that wade and lebron didn't play  bottom line, heat LOST. doesn't matter who played and didn't play.
MudRunnerVA::With Wade, James and Bosh not playing, that wasn't the Heat. If you think it doesn't matter, then wait until the NBA Finals and see who is there.
jakimeadoodle::Does hating Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh make me a homophobe?
MudRunnerVA::No, you jacking off to Jusin Beiber and not admitting it does.
ChitownSuperBowlBound::LOL..no.  Wade cries to the refs every single time the guy shoots/drives to the rim and Bosh literally cries after he loses.  Bosh is just soft which is why guys like Noah who play him physical can shut him down.  Lebron is a beast but when it comes to clutch time, he can't hang.  That's why he went to the Heat in the first place.
GoldenLightfire::Noah got wrecked by James Jones. lol
rajonMVProndo::Miami fears Boston but Chicago doesen't. Miami is happy they aren't 1 seed
rajonMVProndo::being 100% honest i wud rather the celtics play the heat is rose is healthy but if rose isnt healthy then the bulls. the bulls are the best rebounding team and celtics r worst.
LosHeatSonLosMejores9::EatADy.ck^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
zo9292::he's 100% correct so losheat...you please shut up
LosHeatSonLosMejores9::I want what you're smoking..............
LosHeatSonLosMejores9::yawn........................................
nba is the worst::I think the C's would prefer the heatles to the Bulls, based on their success
LosHeatSonLosMejores9::Well, of course, And Boston would rather play the Bulls than Miami.........
rajonMVProndo::u no u wud rather hav miami play indiana than boston
teedotsportsfan::dwyane wade using steroids?  how does a guy that big always have these nagging injuries
teedotsportsfan::ok, whew i wasn't the only one thinking that. ok. just checking
LosHeatSonLosMejores9::His finger got caught in a jersey and was dislocated. Definetly steriods caused this injury,,,,, J E R K - O F F!!

Rossi46Doctor::Heat fans after beating the Bulls the other day: "Get ready for the Heat to get the #1 seed, son!!!"  Heat fans after losing to the Wizards and settling for the #2: "#1 seed doesn't mean anything.  How did that work out for the Bulls last year?"  Which is it, bandwagoners?
SLAYERN8TION::swim chico swim
LosHeatSonLosMejores9::Enjoy Boston in the second round!!!
SLAYERN8TION::whet back
ChitownSuperBowlBound::We don't fear Boston.  Our front court and athleticism will dominate the Celts.  They prefer the Heat because they have ZERO front court and little to no shot blocking.  I would MUCH rather play the 76ers then the Celts/Hawks than the Knicks and then the Pacers.  The Knicks match up very well against the Heat but the Heat should prevail and the pesky Pacers will give you guys a touch series as well.  You'll be beat up by the time the ECF gets here but it won't matter.  The Heat aren't a real team just two great players with one other really good player and the worst bench in basketball except for maybe the Bobcats.
Rossi46Doctor::LOL whaaat?  HAHA!  dude, you're the one who talked about "head hunting."  I merely stated that no one is scared of your team or their weak physicality...  Is James Jones gonna beat up the whole Bulls team?  I'll get my popcorn now, can't wait to see that fight LOLOLOL
LosHeatSonLosMejores9::Sure,,,,,,,,,,,,
LosHeatSonLosMejores9::^^^^Internet tough guy!!! P U S S Y!
miketatham34::The Bulls match up great against the Celts.  Bulls fans generally would like to play Boston over Indiana.
Rossi46Doctor::LOL ok bud.  Really scared.  Maybe if this was MMA... LOL you idiot
LosHeatSonLosMejores9::Hahahaha! Who is scared? Just get out of the first round. We going head hunting if you're precious Flower and the Bulls make it to ECF............
Rossi46Doctor::We will, thank you.  Unlike your team, we're not scared of them, at all.
FlawlessVictoryKid26.0::Neh...the Heat choking their $@% off with their 3 star players in their prime...especially LePussy James in the Finals to the Mavs....is far worse than a newly established Bulls team and their new superstar just starting to coming up.. loosing in the ECF. It's just the truth.
met4life2469::Heat fans are the biggest band wagoners since Lebron arrived. They won't win a title with Lebum.
Rossi46Doctor::Their own newspaper did a report on the huge spike in jersey sales when the Big 2.5 signed up. LBJ/Wade/Bosh were the #1, 2, &amp; 5 top-selling jerseys in the NBA.  Baaaaandwagonnnnnn LOL
Gilchrest89::I know Wade was supposed to play, but a game against the Wizards is the game you'd rest your Big 3.  Guess top seed in the east is not a priority for the Heat.  Bulls haven't been sharp lately, Rose probably won't be completely healthy for the playoffs, and the Heat have not been great on the road.  Heat have a chance at the #1 seed!  NBA playoffs are going to fun to watch this year!
rajonMVProndo::I love how every Celtics fan thinks Doc is stupid for resting the big 4 against Atlanta. Avery Bradley, Keyon Dooling, Sasha Pavlovic, Brandon Bass, and Greg Stiemsma lost to Jeff Teague, Kirk Hinrich, Joe Johnson, Josh Smith, and Jason Collins by 5. If the worst bench in the league only loses by 5 in Atlanta then im pretty sure Rajon Rondo, Avery Bradley, Paul Pierce, Brandon Bass, and Kevin Garnett will beat Atlanta even if Atlanta has homecourt advantage.
jeff050578::D Wade is fragile. It  sucks because I am D Wade fan. I knew he was an elite NBAer when he got that triple double against my Hawaii Warriors in the NCAA tournament. i think the rerason for him being so fragile now is because of all the reckless abandonment he used to play with
nbaplayoffs2O12::Lebron predicts the Heat will win not 1 but 8 championships.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT-I8jQDQ7c  HEAT FANS ARE GASSED UP.
ChitownSuperBowlBound::Talk is cheap...results are 0 not 8.
954_2_da_305::If LeBron doesn't say: "I didnt come here to win a championship." in that situation.  You haters/losers will forever have a problem with it.
Rossi46Doctor::More like, LeBron will have the problem living up to it.
jakimeadoodle::Once ESPN shifted from reporting what happened in sports to reporting what will happen in sports, everything took a gambling infused turn to the surreal
superbad555::LOL about arguing the better franchise!! Im a Heat fan and obviously the Bulls have the better franchise they had the greatest player of all time. What does that have to do with this season? Bottom line both teams are really good but neither one is a guarantee to make it to the finals or win the championship. They have played 4 times and hose games couldn't have been any closer! Oh yeah Indiana and the Celts are playing really good basketball right now so don't look past them!!
iRobot06::I guess my question for Bulls fans is what makes you guys so sure this is your year? I felt like last year every Bulls fan came out the woodwork saying we have the best record in the East it's a done deal. And they're saying the same thing this year lol.
SkipWaterPistolPeteJR::Who knows, that is why they play the games. I think it will be a good series if they meet up, i wouldn't bet my house on either team. I just think Heat fans are way too confident, i am sure they thought the Mavs had no chance to beat them either
nbaplayoffs2O12::what makes you so sure after blowing a 2-1 lead to the Mavs in the NBA Finals?
iRobot06::So since you guys straight up lost that makes it all better? When you choke at least I can say we should've won but with you guys we all know you didn't have a snowball's chance.
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::You lost in the ECF, we lost in the NBA finals
nbaplayoffs2O12::you guys choked...we straight up lost.
Skauboy::Awww how cute. You're in loser denial.
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::Better than losing 4-1 in the ECF.
JMoney996::Hmmm, we have RIP now, a stronger defensive team, and DWade is sort of hurt. Plus, the Heat didn't really get much better now did they?
iRobot06::RIP is your Ace in the hole? LOL funny. You're the same defensive team from last year D Wade is always hurt and the Heat upgraded since last year. Adding Turiaf, Battier, which makes us a better defensive team, and LeBron is more hungry.
angel775714::so wer the heat fans
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::nbaplayoffs2O12 The Bulls organization basically has the Heat organization whipped!    I mean we even got you guys to retire a Bulls players jersey in your own arena!!    You can say it's outta respect.....But I say your whipped. ------ 4-1. 4-1  Plus, is that why the Bulls complained to the NBA before this season about playing the Heat 4 times?
954_2_da_305::As if the Bulls easy $@% schedule wasn't easy enough.
angel775714::the lakers are going to win it this year and get ther 17 championship  not 6 or one   but 6 is still better than one lol
nbaplayoffs2O12::time to watch the Knicks get patty caked in ATL.
rec_tal_ranger::Knicks are a glorified D League team.
954_2_da_305::This guy acts like he knows what the Heat want. If anything the knicks will tank to 8th to play the Bulls because they are afriad to face the Heat.
iRobot06::Who said that? Did anyone from the Heat say that or are you just watching too much ESPN?
angel775714::and yet the heat dont want to face them
slick trip::the bulld had the best player of all time
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::SkipWaterPistolPeteJR AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15  Historically, it doesn't help. 8 of the last 10 #1 seeds in the East missed the finals, 5 missed the ECF.-  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  And they like to argue that because what happened 5-10 years ago somehow will matter now --- Fine, put it this way. No #1 seed has made it to the finals in the last 5 years.
SkipWaterPistolPeteJR::So what the Cavs did five years ago matters to the success of this bulls team?
jakimeadoodle::I'm not saying it's relevant or makes sense, but it is that "logic" upon which these arguments are based
SkipWaterPistolPeteJR::Or the present results throughout 66 games of the actual team that is playing
jakimeadoodle::because the only possible indicator of future performance is past results
SkipWaterPistolPeteJR::Does the team matter? I am making a point. What does it matter what other teams have done?
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::No, actually the Celtics....
FlawlessVictoryKid26.0::Still the Heat should be dominating the Bulls...they have 3 SUPERSTARS in their prime!! The Bulls have one and for two seasons have had the best record in the East over them...I'm just saying. To say the Heat are better is absurd..lol.
angel775714::i rather have 6 rings than one  even if it was a while ago its still more rings

JMoney996::There
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::Last years Final series isn't completely irrelevant, these teams are mostly the same.  No players from the 98 Bulls are on any of these teams, are there?

SkipWaterPistolPeteJR::last year= past
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::No, we aren't living in the past talking about last year
angel775714::6 rings &gt; 1 ring and im not a bulls fan im just saying facts   it doesnt matter if you won a year ago or 20 years ago you still won
jcr54321::and saying that does not help your team at all this year.  what was achieved back then means nothing for the team right now.
FlawlessVictoryKid26.0::In 2006 the Heat had Shaq...lol. Yet after that...O.O

nbaplayoffs2O12::jcr54321 "Those who live in the past are certain to miss the future."

JMoney996::I'd like to see the Heat go 17-9 without your top player(s).
SkipWaterPistolPeteJR::So Wade is your best player? Doubtful
SkipWaterPistolPeteJR::You are stupider than i thought if you try to argue anyone else is
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::And D Rose is yours?
chris1231254::oh yeah
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::13-2, actually
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::We lost last night.

nbaplayoffs2O12::u mad

slick trip::D wade is turning 31 this year.... time is running out d rose is 23..........take your time
slick trip::1 year in a shortened seaon... next year is back to normal...... dwade is gonna be a grandpa
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::And yet, D rose gets injured more than D Wade.
JMoney996::This proves how bad the Heat are without their 3 superstars. Losing to the WIZARDS @ home.
AwesomeSwagmonsterbeast15::If a NBA team loses to another NBA bench, that is pretty sad.
slick trip::the bulls bench has beaten teams on regular bases..including the heat
JMoney996::Exactly
