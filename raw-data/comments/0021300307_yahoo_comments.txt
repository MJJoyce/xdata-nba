Steve::Love Victor's energy. He needs to cut down on turnovers [still], but he'll be really good one day.
PKM::It's sad that Memphis lost Gasol.  He was really playing well and now they might not even make the playoffs.  Some good teams in the Western Conference will miss out.
donald::Koufos is a champion and a leader.
fup duck::wow it's a Jamal Franklin sighting!  He's the 2nd coming of Gary Payton, riding the bench in Memphis
Anton::John Leuer my new fantasy pick up :DDD
