J::If you're benching Enes Kanter and starting Derrick Favors at C when he should be PF and starting Hayward over Burks at SG when Hayward should be SF and be better off, you have no chances at a playoff spot for a few YEARS!
steve::Favors with four rebounds!  What a joke.  #$%$ doesn't steal or block the ball anymore.  Why was he playing so much better last year.  He is terrible.
Shawn::Coach Corbin is ruining these young players. Kanter is the number two scorer and rebounder on the team and Corbin starts bringing him of the bench and taking his playing time. He is starting to play more and more like Corbin did, soft as hell. Kanter was a banger last year and now he won't take any contact. The only thing Corbin is great for is securing a top 3 pick in next years draft.
Devin H::Favors has had a few years to improve..and he doesnt look like he has learned alot. The guy has  athleticism and size and if he had even a mediocre skill level, would be a top 5 pf.   At this point, the Jazz would be improved if they started  Kosta Koufas....Biedrins should get a serious look over 10-12 games..
Curtis::The Jazz are going to win their third game on a five game road trip tonight. I believe Utah has the best rookie in the 2013 draft in Trey Burkes. I think he will be as good as D. Lilliard. I hope Memphis gets healthy so that they can make the playoffs again. Good luck to both teams.
Brendon::Thank goodness for Richard Jefferson, am I right or am I right?
PKM::Favors numbers have gotten pretty good.
