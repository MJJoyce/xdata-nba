Kujosh54321::Good game from both teams, but I'll take the loss in hopes for a good draft pick. Good luck hawks fans!
dwighthowardsamazing::The power forward and center tied for most assists who are the point guards?
AtlSmith1024::That's because they were drawing coverage in the paint and passing out to the open man on the wing who made the shot.  This is basketball, it isn't football.
hussein623::gg bobcats, good luck rest of the year  Go Hawks!
Kujosh54321::You too!
SoWhyYouMadBro::Kemba with another poor shooting night.  he hasn't been the same the past few games....i'm starting to think he's playing injured? Good game Cats but You have to be consistent and close these games out . it's games like this thast may come back to haunt you when your on vacation and not making the playoffs
3gillies::Nice try Charlotte Bobcats you did good without having Tyrus Thomas. This is from 15 Kemba walkers favorite fan
sunderland13::Morale Victory

MasterWangkee::Very good loss for the Bobcats.  We move up in the draft and continue to gain respect in the NBA and improve as a team.
BossCap_40::Both those teams suck
AtlSmith1024::Lakers should have hired Phil when they had the chance.
dwighthowardsamazing::Thats funny they both suck but they have better records than the Lakers
terrbro::Yep 6 game win streak....they suck
Ferrari_458::Says the Lakers fan.
MasterWangkee::Lakers are so old a Magic Johnson reunion team could beat them.
MasterWangkee::Thank God.  Need Shabazz.
dwighthowardsamazing::Nope send him to the hornets Cody zeller or the guy with the flat top from Kentucky can go to charlotte
Andrew4Bama4::Sorry buddy, you guys stole a top pick from us once, won't get it again. esp not this season.

sunderland13::DID MULLENS REALLY HAVE THE GAME TYING SHOT??

terrbro::because he shoots 19% from 3!!!
Talentsojhin::they tried to.
legodjames::Bobcats have a better record than the Lakers.
Sir Gunner::I knew the game was over when Mullens had the ball.
tigersfangoldandblue::How is it that Mullens took the final shot? That is horrible.
tigersfangoldandblue::I saw it. But Gordon aside, you could of given it to someone else.
Sir Gunner::Gordan was covered up, so they had to give it to him.
Mace781::Atl by 10 in OT

Alabamarolls4 14::JOSH SMITHHHH
BossCap_40::Josh Smith sucks
me_destruit::17 points, 12 boards, 6 assists, 3 steals, 5 blocks...47% shooting. Yeah, that really sucks. Oh, also he just defended an inbound pass and Atlanta gets the ball back with 5 seconds left. So baddddd. *rolls eyes*
NBARefsRimRose::this is on josh smith if they lose!!! LOL! EAT IT NGGER!
Sir Gunner::Gordan is cold-blooded.
LetsGoBraves2012::lucky shot
me_destruit::Ben Gordon playing out of his mind from 3. He takes that shot 99 more times, and he likely misses it 98 times.
aaronsmith8818::LOOK UP CELTICS VS BULLS

BossCap_40::They deserve to lose
BossCap_40::WOW!!!! Horrible finish for the Hawks

Mace781::Letsssss go OT!!!!!
NBARefsRimRose::OP = RETURD!
BossCap_40::I don't see how thats gonna happen
aaronsmith8818::SO YOU EXPECT A FREE THROW?
Sir Gunner::Ben Gordan? More like Ben JORDANS.
Talentsojhin::wow
BossCap_40::cant even make the free throws
NBARefsRimRose::that's cause he's a ngger!
NBARefsRimRose::I'm back after fU8king "uk fan 4 ever" mum in the @rse!
MasterWangkee::This Bobcats team better simmer down.  Peaking WAY too early for my taste.  If we miss out on Shabazz, have to give O.J. Mayo a max deal.  I don't want to get trapped in the cycle of mediocrity again.
Sir Gunner::We should keeping losing with style after getting 8 wins. I totally agree, missing Shabazz would hurt us.
Talentsojhin::Zeller would be a good get as well.
