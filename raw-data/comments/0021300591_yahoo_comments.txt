AZ Jim::Frye needs to get out of his funk and start putting some points on the board..Dragic gave his usual 100%, but the inability of everyone to hit shots late hurt, as well as the early turnovers...I wonder how long coach will be putting up with Plumlee's inability to be a stopper in the lane...His positioning is all wrong, yet he has done nothing to correct it is seems...Way too many drives and scores when he is in the middle...
HenryM::Congratulations to the Mavericks. I hope you enter to the play offs. More power to Dirk and Monte.
Charles::The game showed how they need Harris for some defense at guard.  Way too many easy points given to the Suns guards driving to the basket.   Outside the paint, the Suns couldn't hit a thing.
Ngoo Nam::In a team, in a team sports game, you have more chances of winning when everybody contributes big time, like Shane there.  Not even LeBron, MJ and Kobe and Shaq and Dirk can win without teammates contributing. (This is lame, Yahoo!! is so sloow! it's a pain and it's not worth surfing to! What's with the sloowness, Yahoo!!?? If it doesn't improve, goodbye!)
Anton::Suns are mediocre without Bledsoe.
Will::Please reply with a decent sports website, yahoo has just completely ruined there website theres so many holes I cant even see scores or get to recaps this is a joke
Doug::Is that attendance right? Only 16,000? C'mon Phoenix. What's the problem?
Arf::i'm waiting for the mavs to choke again...
PKM::Dragic has been balling.
KingSouljaSide::Larkins sister is bad AF. I peep her at the philly game Go Mavs!!
