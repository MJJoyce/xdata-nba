Spoofen::Dion needs to step up and finish. He's getting lazy in the past few games. Yes this is a Cuse fan saying this. Scott took a chance on him and he's gotta prove him right.
NUPE-NUPE-NUPE::2-8?  Byron Scott will be fired soon.
TheBrownestBob::I don't have a problem with the starters having ho-humm performances as they've been stellar all year.  I have a problem with Scott deciding to play Miles after benching him for a few games and all he does is jack up 8 shots and net 3 points.  Obviously, every time CJ gets the ball he's looking to score... everyone in the building knows it, everyone at home knows it... his time on the floor does nothing but hurt the team tremendously.
crabbymacintosh::has there ever been a Cavs article on here that didnt find a way to somehow mention LeBron?
peter_tom_willis75::hahah.  I was just about to post the same thing.  I'd like to forget him.
YaImFromCleveland::Cavs are on full tank mode now.. oh well
bwp2bruce::Uncle Drew was supposed to be Lebron's replacement.
scottsvb1::RFetter11 , plz don't watch or play basketball cause you know nothing.  Varejao is the team along with Irving. Varejao isn't a consistant 20 pt scorer cause he's not suppose to be. His job is to shoot the ball about 10 times a game on avg but more importantly, get Rebounds and play defense. He's our interior guy to get rebounds on the offense and defensive side of the ball and find the play makers.  Waiters isn't coming along nicely.. he's not showing anything on defense and he thinks too much of himself but lacks NBA talent. He's no Lebron and not saying you would think that.. but he needed another year in college to get disipline.  Cavs need to fire their HC Scott... and get a defensive minded coach. This team will win only 22-25 games this year with Scott.  It's their Coach,  and no Bench that is hurting this team.
RFetter11::One person cant change a team, obviously we showed that with LeBron. Kyrie needs help around him, Waiters is coming along nicely. Thats all though. Varejao is not consistent enough to be a top guy, rebound wize, yes, scoring, no. Cavs to make a blockbuster deal this season and get some real talent to help back up Irving and Waiters, the most supreme backcourt in the NBA.
TheTristanShow::With Lebron we showed one person CAN change a team if anything. He was so dominant in Cleveland there almost wasn't room for another star. I'm glad Kyrie isn't on the same level as Lebron because we'll be able to put a game plan together in the long run where we are not so reliant on one player.
NickFoles1::Breaking News: Andrew Bynum just broke his back doing the Limba
LACLIPPERSFANSINCE1994::Good one.
ddolph2822::76ers problems.... Weak at rebounding No inside threat  If only we had 1 player that could fix this....
wilcox1232::kwame brown
ddolph2822::Holiday completely shut Irving down. Holiday truly is one of the most underrated players in this league.
allwedoiswingames::the cavs and browns have the same record
Dawg112299008877::Waiters kinda sucks.
JrueRandallHoliday::This week, yes, but last week Waiters fans were saying he's better than Wade...  ... true story!
Sam58548::At least the Browns try...Cavs are a joke with Byron Scott as coach.
IKnowYouReadThis::Shame on Uncle Drew...he's a fn scrub...there I said it now fu k k off
YenxRenx::As I prediucted the Cavs and Browns have identical 2-8 records...hahahahahaha
IKnowYouReadThis::This is your moment of Clarity. I say to you soothesayer, oh wise one that you are wise beyond your years...NOT a chance you dirty nutsa ck mu th a fu kk a
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Later fellas I gotta go cook my son dinner
GrandmasBoyDawg858::That t.d was a fraud I took ravens -3.5
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Hahah Steelers are done!
brandonlee561heat22::Now Leftwich hurt lol
FlyGuys623::aight im out peace
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Peace DAWG
brandonlee561heat22::I really hate the BCS
potato623::Almost over
GrandmasBoyDawg858::I know we work off a system to sports betting I know I got one.
GrandmasBoyDawg858::A system called skills baby
FlyGuys623::yo brandon, did you go to fsu?
brandonlee561heat22::yea 2.5 years lol
FlyGuys623::yeh
brandonlee561heat22::I was stupid, and I kinda stopped going to class basically, just partying mostly. You know where Call Street is right?
FlyGuys623::nice. i went all four
potato623::Thad's been terrible the past couple games, he needs to get out of the funk. He can be a 16-8 guy, but he's just not there right now, what's going on?
potato623::Yeah I figured, especially against Toronto tomorrow, their lineup is huge!
DaKing0325_::He's been playing against bigger guys in recent games and has had some tough matchups   I wish Collins would let him play the 3 occasionally, he is simply not big enough to bang inside all the time, Collins has had him playing Center completely out of his element
just let your soul glow::He's  wearing down against the bigger power forwards.
just let your soul glow::The Atlantic division is easily the toughest division in the NBA.
FlyGuys623::southwest is pretty good too
airic.ad::If Turner, Holiday, and one of Hawes/Thad continue to play well, the Sixers will stay well afloat without Bynum.  Turner is the X-factor for me.  He is capable of at least 13/8/4 every night.
GrandmasBoyDawg858::If thats your pic Brandon u look exactly like the brandon I knew!
GrandmasBoyDawg858::I know who Norris cole, I'm a players fan I just follow players I like king James and D wade, I know who Norris is just never payed attention to his face.
brandonlee561heat22::True, a lot of people dont know who he is
GrandmasBoyDawg858::lol alright I have no clue on pics I don't even watch the game honestly!
brandonlee561heat22::nah, thats Norris Cole on Miami
FlyGuys623::norris cole hahahahahahaha
tomBabauts::Sixers have a better record than the Lakers and DEN though. Even without Bynum.
tomBabauts::If Bynum will not be healthy this season they can let him go or PHI can sign him with a cheaper contract.
just let your soul glow::minus Bynum they still have a good team Evan Turner finally showing signs of life
GrandmasBoyDawg858::I dropped out from college to do sports betting!
brandonlee561heat22::I did live in California for a bit, but FL almost my whole life
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Elementary
GrandmasBoyDawg858::u seem like a brandon I know from elementry
brandonlee561heat22::word
GrandmasBoyDawg858::San Diego State
brandonlee561heat22::Where did you go to school at?
FlyGuys623::ha. its working
andrewplayer21::Cavs and Browns 2-8 yikes. Hopefully T mac, Bibby or K mart will be signed this week.
Ryan Hosss::those guys could have helped you 10 years ago
brandonlee561heat22::Hawes said hes getting a haircut tomorrow
FlyGuys623::dont lie dog
FlyGuys623::meh
brandonlee561heat22::might just be getting a trim
FlyGuys623::s.hit
brandonlee561heat22::He said it, he was just talking to the guys on NBA tv
eaglesboy1018::Nice to see Turner finally make an appearance.
IggyIsClutch::Jrue and turner both had 9 assists! Wow maybe we don't need a backup pg
FlyGuys623::i dont see why turner cant be a back up point guard some of the times
dwnstaley::he is the backup "point guard" some of the time. hopefully collins lets him have the ball and direct the team more.
brandonlee561heat22::lmao now Hawes had the headband on
GrandmasBoyDawg858::He tryna promote them white boys bro
IggyIsClutch::Gg
FlyGuys623::im 24, and 15k a month sounds great
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Music producing thats about it fu ck college
ddolph2822::amen brother.
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Blogg
FlyGuys623::what did you major in, in college
GrandmasBoyDawg858::yeah but i want a legit income i wanna work for ESPN
FlyGuys623::by doing what haha?
just let your soul glow::Uncle Jrue told Uncle Drew I gets buckets.
GrandmasBoyDawg858::How do i work for ESPN tired of gambling i make about 15k a month and tired of it!
GrandmasBoyDawg858::nah i hate drugs just lil sour diesel at time, and shots of some remy or patron at times.
GrandmasBoyDawg858::I need a legit income.
just let your soul glow::sure you're not selling yayo
GrandmasBoyDawg858::24
just let your soul glow::You make 15k a month screw ESPN
FlyGuys623::how old are ya
GeorgeTownMan29::"its for you, I think its the devil"
brandonlee561heat22::High score? What does that mean?
FlyGuys623::oh wait i may have seen it on comedy central once or twice
brandonlee561heat22::its hilarious
Sam58548::Best movies of all time...Tremors and Big Trouble in Little China....it is what it is....
potato623::Jrue took it to Irving tonight! That'll be a good one to watch over the years, good game Cavs
just let your soul glow::The guy who predicted the Sixers will draft Jrue Holiday what's good
potato623::I never wanted Lawson, he's one-dimensional, Jrue on the other hand can be a great defender as well as a volume scorer and distribute as well.  Right now he is struggling with TO's but it'll get better over time.
just let your soul glow::potato623 - Nothing much, just enjoying some solid basketball. The reason I wanted this guy, his D in High School/College was spectacular, can't teach good D like that   I wonder what happened to all those idiots that wanted Ty Lawson over Jrue Holiday.
potato623::Nothing much, just enjoying some solid basketball. The reason I wanted this guy, his D in High School/College was spectacular, can't teach good D like that
GeorgeTownMan29::is Bynum ret-arded
DaKing0325_::Good  win tonight but why does Collins ride Spencer Hawes so much, this guy gets entirely too many shots in our offense   Also why doesn't Dorell Wright get minutes anymore, Collins is gonna burn out his starters by the end of the season, Turner played 40 mins tonight
Sh4k4zulu::plus turner was 8-12 why take him off court when he had a +10
Sh4k4zulu::they're in their early 20's not in their late 30's lol it's all about defensive mismatches and collins probably figured wright didn't match up well but he still got 11:46 with 1-4 (1-3 3pm-a) with 4 rebounds and 1 dime and a steal
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Has anyone ever watched Grandmasboy?
GrandmasBoyDawg858::U should bro funny movie thats how i got my name
brandonlee561heat22::'How did he see me?'
DeerandBeer91::funny movie
FlyGuys623::nah
Sh4k4zulu::ooo 4 blocks by mullet
brandonlee561heat22::Hope Detroit takes it to BOS tonight
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Riding with boston -4
brandonlee561heat22::seems like a lock
Sh4k4zulu::hawes - 9 points 4th quarter
FlyGuys623::ya see i used reverse psych
just let your soul glow::Wow Holiday held Kyrie Irving to 9 points 2 in the last 36minutes.
potato623::Nice game Turner! Good D Jrue
GrandmasBoyDawg858::Ravens -3 good play or what!
Sam58548::So this Cavs team has talent now...whats Byron Scott's excuse now?
Matt.Ballinger::really? who?
Sam58548::Irving and Varejao are a great combo.
DeerandBeer91::They have no bench at all
Sam58548::mikey getting mad...lmao
mikeyp2307::hey sh.it for brains, look at the good teams in the league. they almost all have good benches. you cant be good unless you have a decent bench. the cavs bench is putrid
Sam58548::so he needs everything to win. Heck might as well hire me or you as coach...we can win with that too.
FlyGuys623::6-4. not bad.
brandonlee561heat22::5th place
FlyGuys623::next 2 games should be wins too
ddolph2822::Drew is such a dumb way to spell Jrue.
FlyGuys623::anjrue holiday
