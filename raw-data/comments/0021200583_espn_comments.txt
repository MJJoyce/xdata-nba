nba is the worst::After 38 games last year, heat were 29-9
johnnydhow22::Laker fans is Howard staying in LA?
lakersfann1990::yep he had a interview during practice and said hes happy playing in LA win or lose
rjboi305::What you expect him to say his not happy there? Of course his going to say he's happy in LA
Ivanov21::Didn't Howard score a lot more lately? Didn't LA play a lot better when he got more touches? How come Kobe took 18 more shots against Miami ? Hilarious
thoughtuknew73::Kobe Bryant. What a bum
Aeiouy.com::The heat might sign Howard as a fa when they trade Lebron and miller to Dallas
endless glory::5000+ assists&gt;30000+ points

LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::Chicago will probably win that game with some scrub bench player going off from three.
nba is the worst::Rose might even play
lulzangeleslakers101::^Hence why I got them in March lol.   I am fairly confident he will be playing by then according to the latest news on him.   Edit: I was debating between Feb or March and took March for security that Rose would most likely play. They play the heat in both months.

LeBron James Goat 234::my problem is against idiotic trolls like yourself
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::he won't get banned just because you flag him.  he has to be doing an overload obvious trolling or some other violation.  you don't get banned just for being stupid.

nba is the worst::Mambaholic 33 - First time you seen guys diving for the ball and no travel call, might want to watch few more gms -=-=-  Err - it wasn't the dive for the ball, it was him standing up with it after grabbing it.  Anyone that plays the game knows that's an automatic travel.  Even Joey Crawford
jaydubespn::^Yeah but then he wouldn't get to bash LeBron.
Mambaholic 33::First time you seen guys diving for the ball and no travel call, might want to watch few more gms
nba is the worst::You miss him standing up with the ball after diving to the floor to get it and rolling over?  Nocall of the year!
Mambaholic 33::Now that's funny...Lebron traveling? compared to Kobit-ch who carriers and takes 3-4 steps before he even puts the ball down 20 times game  what next Lebron shoots to much...ROR
FadeBackShootBrick::I wouldn't say half the stuff I say on here to kobe tho..I actually like kobe, I just do it to get under the kobetards skin..

ESPN Mod 1985::you wouldn't do sh*t
FadeBackShootBrick::I wonder if anybody said any rape jokes to him yet lol

FadeBackShootBrick::lol the trolls are in full force on kobes twitter.wow and I thought lebron had a lot, wow..he's going to delete it soon.
LeBron James Goat 234::kobe is clueless in social media lol.   I tweeted him a week ago, "Hey Kobe thanks for building my house, you're the best!"  and he retweeted it. LMAOOOOOOO
FadeBackShootBrick::LMAO HAHAHAAHA that's funny, I feel bad for him tho
ESPN Mod 1985::I'm positive Kobe wouldn't respond to a 5 year old such as yourself
LeBron James Goat 234::um check his twitter dumbazz. he retweets his fans all the time
ESPN Mod 1985::NBA Championships  Michael Jordan = 6/6 with 6 NBA Finals MVP's  Kobe Bryant = 5/7 with 2 NBA Finals MVP's  Lebron James = 1/3 with 1 NBA Finals MVP's
jaydubespn::Proving what?
Mambaholic 33::Opposed to no point...
lulzangeleslakers101::^were you trying to make a good point or something lol?
Mambaholic 33::Compared to Shaq.-Horry-Gasol-Fish-Bynum-Howard-Nash  --When Bosh played with his 4 rebounds gm
lulzangeleslakers101::^The finals are where you win a ring....so they aren't the only playoffs games....but they are the MOST important.  Oh and @ Mambaholic  Yeah LBJ didn't have Wade who was 3rd in PER in both 2011 and 2012 and Bosh
Mambaholic 33::That they had far more talent and Phil as coach
jaydubespn::^If you think the Finals are the only playoff games, then yes.  However that is not so.
lulzangeleslakers101::Jordan is 100% ?
LeBron James Goat 234::check out kobe's twitter. people are trolling it, and Kobe doesn't realize it and is responding in a serious way.  hahahahahahahaha  https://twitter.com/kobebryant

ESPN Mod 1985::You are obsessed with Kobe Bryant and you hate him?
lulzangeleslakers101::the fake KB account?
LeBron James Goat 234::he's on twitter now. you didn't hear the news?
LeBron James Goat 234::no thats kobe's verified account
ESPN Mod 1985::Why do Lebron and Kobe fans argue so much about who is greater?  As a Bulls fan and growing up watching Michael Jordan we never needed to argue about him being the GOAT his game speaks for himself
DanNYC2108::probably because you didn't have message boards
LeBron James Goat 234::Kobe rode Shaq, Bynum, and Gasol dick in the reverse cowgirl position while screaming, "Yea tear that sh.it up! Gimme that ring!"  he's tryna ride Dwight now but Dwight don't roll that way
ESPN Mod 1985::Great game last night would like to see them in the Finals but anything is possible
FadeBackShootBrick::best sidekick..pippen or kobe? kobe has a better jumpshot but I'll take pippen he could defend, pass and score
lulzangeleslakers101::"MJ could average 50ppg a game in today's league"   -Scottie Pippen
Mambaholic 33::Just have to point to last night! who was going to guard Howard-Gasol-Jamison-Clark....Its call speed and athleticism
lulzangeleslakers101::lol who the hell would guard Hakeem, Robinson, Shaq, Ewing, or Mutombo?   The best center in the league is Dwight and he isn't even a legit 6'10'' without shoes.   Edit: Let alone guarding MJ.
Mambaholic 33::Like the European league and our collage players that could compete at one time with. Not to mention how much faster football has gotten with lineman running 4.6 at 300 pounds...who the hell would guard Lebron-Kd-Westbrick-CP -Melo- Rose, to name a few...please!
lulzangeleslakers101::^ check ASPM and PER  Players have roughly gotten NO better since the 90's......
Mambaholic 33::Right! all the players getting slower,smaller and less athletic with better training   ---Brilliant 0.0

FadeBackShootBrick::your point? my question was about pippen and kobe
FadeBackShootBrick::@lul..I did? where did I say it..it looks like I didn't..like I said..reading is fundamental
lulzangeleslakers101::^yeah I just realized I mis-read that.  Regardless I am nit-picking just like you.  Stop avoiding the fact that you can't punctuate.
FadeBackShootBrick::yes but what does that have to do with what I said? stop avoiding the fact that you can't read
lulzangeleslakers101::^correct punctuation. It's fundamental too.
lulzangeleslakers101::Pippen easy.   Pippen &gt; LBJ &gt; Kobe
lulzangeleslakers101::^"Can be"   -Scottie Pippen  Don't lie. haha
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::"LeBron is the greatest to ever play the game."  -Scottie Pippen
DanNYC2108::i don't care what kind of situation you are talking about, you are saying something stupid
lulzangeleslakers101::you did....
FadeBackShootBrick::who said pippen couldn't score on lebron?  reading is fundamental  I said  pippen couldn't score like lebron bruh
lulzangeleslakers101::^@ Dan  I am simply talking in a 1 on 1 type situation or if Pippen was guarding LBJ.   I am not saying Pippen is better offensively.
DanNYC2108::How is Pippen better than Lebron? they have very similar games except lebron is better at every aspect of it
lulzangeleslakers101::lol if Jason Terry can score on LBJ.  So can Pippen. AND lock him down too.
FadeBackShootBrick::um no  lebron&gt;pippen&gt;kobe  pippen couldn't score like lebron

Mambaholic 33::Just shows how good Mia is when they have a off night from the perimeter they still win by 9....  0.0
lulzangeleslakers101::^it was; because of how bad and pathetic both sides played.  Was surprised how fast Miami let Lakers back in the game after those initial 4 dunks off the bat.

LeBron James Goat 234::Mike Dantoni on coaching LeBron in the olympics:  "He's the best player I've ever had the privelage of coaching. Easily. We wouldn't have won the gold without him. Of course we had Durant, Melo, Kobe, but we don't beat Spain without him. "  OUCH. coming from your own coach. that's gotta hurt.
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::Did he really say that?  Because LeBron and D'Antoni had beef back in 2004, I think.
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::Well there was a vote cast among the coaches on whether James would be one of the cuts off the 2004 team, and I think it was D'Antoni who was the sole vote for him to be cut... and that caused some rumors to spread on the interwebz.
LeBron James Goat 234::yea look it up. LeBron is likeable he don't have beef with many people for long
FadeBackShootBrick::lol real laker fans don't like kobrick..just the kobetards who lick his nuts
LeBron - The Greatest Of All Time - James::Nah, they like him... when he's not losing games... but it's the old saying:  he's an a-hole, but he's their a-hole.
