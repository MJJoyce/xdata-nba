ACT1v1::Am I missing something about Turner? I do not like Turner's offensive game at all. He's a good player. A terrible shooter and shot selector. I absolutely hate his jumpshot form as well. I love his rebounding and ability to push the ball, run an offense. He has the athleticism to make his wily shots fall sometimes. But, last night he shot 26 x's for 30%. When the next highest shot taker had 18 attempts. He's young and has the upside of growing into a much better player. But, I think Evan will be a Gift &amp; a Curse for the Sixers this season.
GodEmperorKing::Terry had a bad night and Pierce missed a few too many as well... Lets get the win tonight!
r3conklin::Stat of the night- Jason Terry 1-12 from the field. That's the game.
johnnyalexis14::Sportscenter is garbage.  I wait 20 minutes to see Sixers highlights &amp; they show 15 seconds worth of Boston players making shots and tying it up in end.  Only sixers shot they show is the Evan Turner GW'r.  biased much?  oh by the way, Celtics lost ESPN, in case you didn't notice.
Shaun0088::Biased much?You do know ESPN is anti Celtics dont you?
crichtonu::Theyre going to cater to the team that has a fan base.  Deal with it.
johnnyalexis14::I will deal with my win, while you deal with your moral victory.  Triple double wasted effort.
killahs_ghost::They're going to cater to the team that lost, too, apparently.  17,921 in attendance last night.
stop the duck7::sixers r younger then i thought....holiday is only 22 wtf hes seemed like hes been in the league for years wow they gonna be good in a few years
MikeChap86::If only the Sixers had a great Post player... just imagine what they could do with this young talent. :(
Td4mvp3::people need to stop comapring this seasons' teams to last seasons' teams...every team in the NBA is just a little bit different and playing on a slightly different level....so to say "ur team is going to get beat just like last year" is an assumption based on a different year....new season different teams guys....
flyguys44::so the sixers win and ESPN just mentions it in passing... bullsh!t
TheKilbo::True...  But Boston remains a flagship franchise that generates fan interest and revenue.  Proof?  The comments here focus on Rondo, whether you love him or hate him, not on the Sixers win or their best player.
johneon::HA HA HA!! Hondo is a punk.. Shoulda let PP take the last shot. Atleast he woulda bumped a defender and flopped to get free throws.
BluffBrant::Sounds like you're scared of Rondo...can't blame you.
rustyburg::Can we finally get rid of the rule that allows teams to move the ball three quarters of the way down court after a made basket and a timeout?  The NFL doesn't allow teams to start at their opponents 25 after a touchdown and a timeout, so why does basketball?
tehofficialtvtech9::It's for "basketball reasons" rusty
killahs_ghost::I was thinking the same thing.
rustyburg::Seriously ESPN?  That's your headline for this game?  I will guarantee you that if Rondo hit the winning shot with 3.9 seconds left and Turner slipped on the final, game winning attempt the headline wouldn't have been, "Turner flubs the final shot!"
pleX.::Yeah he gets a triple double and the headline is "flubs final shot"  kinda comical
stickgril::he AIRBALLED it and it was funny as heck to watch....
rustyburg::And he didn't even flub it...he slipped.  And heck, he just about had that triple double in the first half.
evanm1204::The Celtics need to get someone who can score consistantly. Rondo can't carry the team every night
TforTempleU1::Holiday and Turner future superstars
MrBaxter555::Not that this team is going anywhere anyway, but until Pierce realizes his best days are WAY behind him, they will continue to lose games like this.....forget Rondo's shots....Pierce is shooting 40% and probably 20% from 3......until he turns over he team to someone, they are doomed.....just look at the layup he missed at the end (and they ended up losing by 1) and the 9 for 24 from the field...there's where the game was lost.....
Fraka9::I dont blame Rondo at all. Pierce was the PG. SG SF PF and C all 2nd half. His ego is enormous , he still wants to be elite. And then Rondo has the ball for the last shot even thou he took only 1 shot all 2nd half. Yeah nice logic.
PhiladelphiaPhil30::nice
Nowitzki.::Ray Allen made the right choice to walk away from this team,where freaking Rondo takes the most decisive shot of the game.
Nowitzki.::Rondo showing once again why he's one of the biggest idiots playing in the NBA
crichtonu::Yeah, only idiots get triple doubles!
rustyburg::He slipped on a wet spot...how's that being an idiot?  Or did you just read the headline?
Khawlyne::The guy had a triple double almost in just the first half, he thought he had less time than he did. You are just dumb
diego3494::celdikks   suck
crichtonu::yeah, they got blown out by a full point!
.United We Run.::LaVoy Allen is garbage
dwnstaley::he's fine for what he is as a ROLE player. he does the dirty work like boxing out and getting rebounds and tipping loose balls to his teammates.  he had a great pass to thad young underneath by faking a jump shot to draw others towards him.
PhiladelphiaPhil30::He's a young player give him time.
ddolph2822::He's by no means a stud. But he's been solid. Almost a double double tonight.
jbpicks4u::how did lavoy allen play
POSTBUSTERSo_O::Good....thought he looked pretty agressive although he didnt score much
jasondmce1978::why on earth doesn't Doc realize that it isn't Terry's night?  44 minutes vs. 29 for a hot Jeff Green??
deanharrison94::is Chris Forsberg a man or a woman
ddolph2822::both
