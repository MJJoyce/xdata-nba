It Was Written::Knight and Mayo have to be the worst backcourt pairing in the league, two combo guards who inefficiently score first and cant set up teammates. Can they just move the Bucks to Seattle, if they aren't going to put money into the team(why is Drew constantly benching Henson???) to be competitive then save Milwaukee and the NBA the suffering
Bball247::Bucks fans!  Can anyone please explain what is going on with Ersan?!  He's one of my favorite players in the league when he is on, but he's been so off lately!  Ersan opinions, please voice them!
Ryan::The Bucks may suck, but they have a serious star in the making with John Henson... They need to build around him..
PKM::Another great NBA game thanks Stern.
John::The NBA is like that Seinfeld episode when the Frozen Yogurt shop finally makes the yogurt fat free after Jerry's fat discovery.  Newman at the end goes "I can't eat this stuff" after he takes a couple bites of the new frozen yogurt while everyone discovers that its now nasty to eat. I feel like Newman when it comes to the NBA and say "I can't watch this stuff"
JoshM::What gives with OJ Mayo?
Frank::Larry Drew #$%$!!! Put Henson back you stubborn prick!!!
Jason::my god this bucks organization have done everything wrong.
Pax Mentis::Wolters/Ridnour Mayo/Knight Middleton/Giannis Giannis (Henson)/Ilyasova Henson (Larry Sanders)/Raduljica  Your welcome Coach Drew..
Anton::Good loss by the Tanks, I mean Bucks...
