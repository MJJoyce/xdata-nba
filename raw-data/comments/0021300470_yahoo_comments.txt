Fort Apache::Wolves need to get Budinger healthy so that they can balance the court; all their points come from Love and Pekovic. Maybe Martin will wake up; he's been sleepwalking for 10 games. Wolves need to pick up another useful player until Bud gets back. The starting 5 are getting tired of having to play so many minutes. The playoffs are starting to look more distant for the Minnesotans. Pelicans' length will dominate both Love and Pekovic, who can't defend vertical size.
Trace Mann::I really thought that the Wolves would be a playoff team this year. the talent is there. Poor chemistry and players playing out of position, and injuries have pretty much killed any chance they have at making the Playoffs!
Amir::Holiday 15.5+ is easy money as its easy to gamble + on any starting PG that face Rubio , lets see what happens.
Dan::Two teams in similar positions. Wolves will definitely have a chip on their shoulder after getting boned by Ed Malloy at the end of the Dallas game. I think we all saw the apology from the league coming. Let's try not to put ourselves in a 21 point hole tonight.  WOLVES!
brett::Let me know when either team wins a game.  Watch the MIND BENDING THUMB BENDING video on Youtube for information on the conspiracy to destroy the black race. Thank you.
Commenter::wolves win
urbad::Go Wolves.
Notorious JP::Eric Gordon seems not fit to the team. When he was in the court, there was no ball movement at all.
- LJ::k love around 23 - 45 points and 11 - 19 rebounds
fup duck::Davis doesn't see many touches with these shoot-first guards with Nola
