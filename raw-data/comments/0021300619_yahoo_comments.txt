Dr.J::Can someone please tell me why 2 of the best in West isn't nationally televised? I was really looking forward to this game
jay truth::The highest personal foul count for a center was Freeland.  LOpez and Aldridge combined for 1!!! what ever happened to being an intimidating inside presence by checking the guy coming into the lane?  46 points on 17 of 25?? You have to be kidding me.
Amir::Batum decided to be non factor tonight, Bad offense and even worse defense even Durant looks like extraterrestrial recently.
Jeff::I'm not a Thunder fan, but we are witnessing the greatest scorer of our generation. Period.
grimlock::There were two missed fouls on back to back blocks towards the end of the game for the Blazers that changed everything.  That and Durant getting really #$%$ off.  It could have gone either way both teams played well.  Can't wait for Westbrook to return and these teams to play again. I hope they both meat deep in the playoffs that will be an exciting series too watch.
DC::Just hand Kevin Durant the MVP trophy already.
Drew::GO THUNDER!! Houston did them a favor last night. Hopefully the Thunder can take advantage tonight. They seem like they've kind of adjusted to no Westbrook.
GILLICUMSISLAND::I think the blazers are the only team whose players wear makeup especially that frenchphag - somebody needs to check his visa.
Joe::KD is a beast, the world knows.  The Blazers don't have a celebrity player, so they don't get any publicity like the rest of the top western conference teams.  Blazers have won the first two match-ups, no reason to think they can't win a third.  We match up well against OKC.  Hopefully OKC doesn't shoot as well as Houston did last night.
Dr.J::And Skip Bayless said he wasn't a top 3 player hahahah that's funny
