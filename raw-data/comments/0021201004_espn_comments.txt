Super Bowl NFL 11-11-93::The Pacers can clinch a playoff berth tomorrow with a 76ers loss.
MasterOfLogic::At first I was shocked to see the Pacers game in the top video highlights.... then I remembered that and only one other game were finished...
Area55andG2::So who we got in the final 4?  mines Louisville, Ohio St., Florida, Indiana

JollySwagman27::I have Minnesota over UCLA as my only big upset pick
JollySwagman27::Ohio State, Indiana, Michigan, Louisville.  Too Big10 homerly?  I want to pick the Spartans but that region is brutal with Duke/Louisville/etc
Area55andG2::yeah. I think soo haha
MasterOfLogic::MSU vs Ohio State Kansas vs Indiana
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::VSU, they will be the "butler" this year.
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::VCU* Excuse me
Fayhey38::Wow.  Last two games Hansbrough gets playing time.  See what he can do.
JollySwagman27::not to debbie downer his performance the last 2 nights but we were playing bad teams.  i'd like to see him put up starters numbers in starters minutes against better competition.
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::Plumlee had most the highlights though.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Gotta defend my team.  I'm out!  Troll mode: Disengage.   Go Magic.
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::godspeed my son
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::You should be pissed at your owner.  He's selling you hope.  Profiting off of your good faith.  He'll make a lil less profit than the two teams who make it to the Finals. True story. Look it up.   You're being played.
JollySwagman27::actually... he's profiting off of YOU and YOUR fan base.  Revenue sharing, look it up.  So who is getting played again?
Area55andG2::Pacers fans are smart we got like the 25th attendance rating in the league
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::I mean, espn never gives any credit to the aba.  But if you listen to guys like Larry brown and other people who were a part of both leagues, the aba was just as talented if not better.
JollySwagman27::the ABA had the talent the NBA had but they almost bankrupted themselves to get it.  That's why, in the long run, the ABA folded and some teams merged into the NBA.
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::Yup.  And the nba stole the 3 point line and the dunk contest.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::No but seriously Pacers you have a great team.   Seriously.  Just not great enough to win anything but regular season games.
JollySwagman27::Check in on us when we make the ECF
Area55andG2::we'd gladly return the compliment, but we can't sincerely say the same
Area55andG2::nupe nupe and double cheese would make a fine couple.
Remember when michigan was relevant... Me neither::.
JollySwagman27::NUPE...NUPE...NUPE Yea you looked stupid for like 20minutes straight.   You jealous because that's your thing?
Frank Vogel Is My Hero::Able to go to the game tonight. Was glad the refs allowed it to be semi-physical. That circus shot by George was sick!
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Were you even alive when these titles were won?
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::If the Pacers won 3 titles 40yrs ago &amp; there is no footage of it, did it really happen?
DWoe23::If the romans ruled the middle east for 100s of years but there wasnt any footage for it... does this mean that it didnt happen?
cflip37::---
Area55andG2::kinda like the Magic. Except there isn't even a myth
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::You're bragging about championships that they don't even have video of.  Its like a myth.   Did it really happen?
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::We had a player that won co mvp with Julius erving, who went on to win mvp like every year when he joined the nba if that says anything. And 2 other hall of famers.
JollySwagman27::let's stop talking about how great the Revolutionary War was for this country, since there's no video documentation.  throw it out of the textbooks!
MasterOfLogic::In that case... Wilt Chamberlain never really existed.  Btw... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDb7KqdLtv4
Area55andG2::I don't understand why nupe thinks the Pacers don't stand a chance against the heat. The heat won the regular season series 3 to 1 last year, and the playoff  series 4-2, but it was much closer  This year the Pacers won the regular season series 2-1 and are better from last year.
MasterOfLogic::ABA was a football league, right?  -- Nupe
JollySwagman27::Swedish band?
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::The ABA bro?   -____-
lboogie737::Nupe it's been fun, Come back sometime.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Naaawwwwww, I'll stay. I'm a Magic fan.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Yea you looked stupid for like 20minutes straight.
lboogie737::Nah Nupe, All in good fun come back sometime. And good luck to your boys.
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::Damn, thought you were a pistons fans. Excuse my ignorance.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::You can't brag about ABA championships bro.  No way bro.  You're losing bro.
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::Yea. Julius Erving was a nobody when he joined the nba.  Way to much talent for him to play well.
TheOneAndOnlyKR::Actually it's a tie bro. Since the Magic have never won either.
MasterOfLogic::Why not? Were they fixed like the one in 2006?
JollySwagman27::Ouch Ibaka just took an elbow to the face.  he's a bleeder!
TheOneAndOnlyKR::So what Indiana team are you guys rooting for in the tourney? IU, Butler, ND, or Valpo?
JollySwagman27::Hoosiers!  (I live 20 minutes from Bloomington)  But, I'll root for all the other Indiana schools too.  Especially Butler
MasterOfLogic::Butla
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Indiana St.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Wait did a Pacer fan just brag about 3 championships, 40yrs ago, in the ABA!?!?!?!?!?  LMAO!  Child please.
JollySwagman27::it's as relevant as anything you've brought up on here.
sportinyeah::&lt;00FFFF&gt;um
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::Detroit = most miserable city in america.  We understand your anger nupe. http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2013/02/21/detroit-tops-2013-list-of-americas-most-miserable-cities/
iownamicrowave::Nupe has won.  he is a winner.
Area55andG2::MVT MVT MVT
Big Booty Smasher SWAG EDITION::Pacers are a good team but never get anywhere. If they couldn't do it will Miller they never will.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::If you added Miller to this team in his prime they still aren't going to beat the Heat.
MasterOfLogic::3 titles.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::40yrs ago in the ABA!!
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Remember when Lance got knocked out last year?
MasterOfLogic::Remember when you made a sensible statement? I'm struggling to remember.
Area55andG2::remember when Orlando was dependent on the every passing breath of Dwight Howard?
Area55andG2::Pacer relevance is bothersome, so I think I'm going to troll  - Nupe
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::"Oh, he mad!"
Hot Pockets needs to get laid::oh boy, a detroit troll lol.  At least detroit is #1 in something.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2013/02/21/detroit-tops-2013-list-of-americas-most-miserable-cities/
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::"We're winning all these games in the regular season! :) Only to lose in the second Rd :( "   - Pacer fans.
lboogie737::Hold on...  I'm still laughing
lboogie737::Nupe is really mad....HHaaaahaaa haaa.
Area55andG2::Congratulations Nupe you won.
JollySwagman27::I feel bad for Magic fans after looking at that box score.  that's some wretched shooting from your starters
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Want a cool ranch Dorito taco???  :(
JollySwagman27::i tried one.  they are gross.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Pacer fans?!?!?  Hello?  Did I win?
TheOneAndOnlyKR::You just referred to either Ben Wallace or Rasheed Wallace as a "Super Star" you just lost.
TheOneAndOnlyKR::I think putting either of them in the same category that we refer to Lebron, Kobe, Durant, and so on is just hilarious.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::What do you think loser?
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Blue collar teams have never won a Championships.  Don't say Detroit. Wallace was an aging super star &amp; that team was flat out better than this crap-shot Pacer team.  Bwahahahahahahahaha!
cflip37::18-50 teams dont get championships? Do you know how actual contenders got their champion winning stars?
PaulGeorgeisFuture::i really don't get what is so funny....
lboogie737::Really Mad....HAhha ahahh ahhh.
Area55andG2::18-40 teams never win a championships either
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::"I think I'm better than Roy"   - JaVale McGee
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Roy - 14mil 10pts &amp; 8rebs  Vuc - 2mil - 12pts &amp; 12rebs  EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!
Area55andG2::Danny Granger was putting up 25.8 ppg on a bad team. It's pretty easy to put up good numbers on awful teams
TheOneAndOnlyKR::Hedo Turkoglu 11.8 Million  Paul George 2.5 Mill   Sickkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::He doesn;t even play. You rely on Roy A LOT  LOL! You just made it worse!!! EW!
TheOneAndOnlyKR::So your team gives out 12 mill a year to bench scrubs? Great franchise you got there.
NUPE...NUPE...NUPE::Roy - 14mil   James - 18mil  Ewwwwwwwww! GROSS!
trizzo23::nelson 8
Area55andG2::Jameer Nelson what 12 mil?
iownamicrowave::NUPE-?
Area55andG2::it's funny how nupe has the arrogance to troll when his own team has a  SUB .300 record
cflip37::He saying it would be better collecting top 5 picks then staying in purgatory, hopelessly waiting for some superstar to become disgruntled with his team enough to demand a trade or walk
TheOneAndOnlyKR::Apparently being the team to lose in the finals is just as bad as being the bobcats and Magic.
iownamicrowave::That classic logic
