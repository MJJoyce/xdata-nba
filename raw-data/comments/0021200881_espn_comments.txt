Duner_TD::Serge Ibaka is a cheapshot bltch.
BarrelRider04::So lets take a look at Vinnie Dumb Dumbgro's coaching decision playing Mrs. Kardashian...here are his numbers so far this year: 20.5MPG &amp; 4.1 Points per .401 FG % &amp; .448 FG % less than 1 Block and Steal a game, and 5.8 RPG. So....in other words he is basically useless (minus a few boards which anyone else could get) but Dumb Dumb continues run him out there in the most crucial minutes of the game. Somebody PLEASE EXPLAIN (and I don't want to hear size and stretching the D)
oblique15::lol you sure don`t like Mrs. Kardashian
oblique15::Yeah, I like the Thunder but wanted the Spurs to make the finals last year, cause they can play more styles than the Thunder.
BarrelRider04::Well this is supposed to be PROFESSIONAL basketball with PROFESSIONAL coaches, right?
RUMBLEizmyWINGMAN::staples center the 2nd home for the OKC Thunder
RUMBLEizmyWINGMAN::clips might have won a game or 2 doesnt qualify as owned.
Jmac4539::OKC got lucky, clips usually owns OKC even last year
RafaWoods01::Define usually and luck.
BarrelRider04::Thunder, if you guys get to the finals against LeBron, you have got to take on the challenge and not be scared of him. You guys have played weak against LeBron and he has owned  you guys. You guys have good defense and you will need to play team defense against him and I think you guys can do it.
oblique15::yeah, how is it that the freaken Knicks do better against the Heat than the Thunder?
BarrelRider04::Match-ups. NBA is most of the time about match-ups. It's up to the coach's to figure it out.
NBASantas::Santa Griffin really took one for the team. http://nbasantas.blogspot.com/2013/03/below-santas-belt.html
Qster15::What baffles me is... why was Ibaka still allowed to stay in the game after that foul on Griffin? Stu Jackson needs to suspend Ibaka a good 5 games for that! DIRTY.. just DIRTY
amtrack5::I dont think a cup check is so uncommon down low.  In fact, it probably happens to  Griffin every single game.  Ibaka just made it very very obvious.
Beef Biscuit::Looks like Ibaka is bout dis life  -Setephen Jackson
Da-THUN-Da::Good/Needed win Thunder. Dirty play Ibaka dont do it agian. Lamar Odom does suck.
DAnnyPrImetIme15::Ibaka tomahawked Blake right in the balls. Dirty. But the Clippers always flop so I dont know where I stand.
ThosF::Well back in 2008 Carmelo Anthony was suspended for 15 games for an ineffectual punch so this one should be worth at least 20 or 25.  Of course that was an actual fight or something like it and this was just a cheap shot against someone not expecting to be attacked so I guess they will just let this one slide.
ThunderHornz::I did not like it. Don't want that rep,
jasiekforever::vinny's rotation is to play everyone
BarrelRider04::I think we are still a coach and 1 or 2 players away from a ring. We need a center who can actually score and play D and we surely need someone better than Mrs. Kardashian coming off the bench for Griffin and playiing key minutes down the stretch. We get that and we are in the conversation...until then, we will just be a very good team, but not a great team...
BarrelRider04::Fellow Clip fans, we will not be contending for a title if the current rotation by Vinnie Dumb Dumgro that includes Mrs. Kardashian in it down the stretch continues. Our coach cannot figure out a rotation and playing Mrs. Kardashian in the most crucial minutes in the most ludicrous, baffling thing I've seen in a long time. Also, our defense has greatly improved over years past, but still isn't consistent enough over 48 minutes to win a 7 game series against Spurs/Thunder/Heat. We're getting closer though....

kidplay44::No does not warrant an ejection
ZAZAalpaca::he gotta pretty quickly aye haha
Sonic_Sooner::Why would Ibaka have gotten ejected?
ThosF::That was a closed fist punch to a defenseless player.  If that happened on the street it would be called assualt.  This isn't hockey.
Sonic_Sooner::If Griffin hadn't flopped, it wouldn't have even been a foul call.

evanharris124::26 points off 8-21 shooting. You should get a clue.
RafaWoods01::Parker and others have made Paul look bad too. I'd take Russ over Paul, even though Chris is certainly a better floor general.
brandonstephensy::agreed..but i guess he ha a problem with an athletic PG matchup
BurntOrange5021::I would take CP3's ability to run an offense over Westbrook's ego any day.
Devinhuelsmann::BurntOrange5021 - I would take CP3's ability to run an offense over Westbrook's ego any day.  But you have to admit that Westbrook out played CP3. but i agree i would want CP3 as the face of my franchise over Westbrook
