Rip City Forever::Still cant get over that shot by NICOLAS BATUM!!!! Batum is the man!
team kyle1::Congrats to the blazers although I must say how did the refs miss the 2 goaltending calls that should have gone to the Cavs and than an obvious foul on zeller in the final seconds of the second ot.
Zyme86::Is it so terrible that its disappointing when I see my team win. Loooose, you need the picks!!!!
Uhggly::Sing it with me.. "Waiters is a bust.. a big fatty bust" Do wah diddy, diddy dum, diddy do
mikeyp2307::yea. 17 games into his rookie season. im sure thats enough time to label him a bust.
scottsvb1::Gee, you think?  Only LBJ had enough talent to go from HS to the NBA.  Waiters needed 2 full seasons of College... and this is "Tech" his first year of college ball but in the NBA.  He needs to learn how to  1. SHOOT 2. Play Defense  He's not a NBA player right now
Treydey10::Dion Waiters played 2 seasons at Syracuse.
Pau Gasol.::I know nothing about Varejao's contract, but the Cavs should trade him to a contender and keep the rebuilding process going. Varejao is a +hustle player who any guy would love to have on their team
scottsvb1::No Way,,,, you keep talent,not give it away... they are not the Indians
Rex Ryan .::<b></b>
127decibels::Just a comment on the highlight video by ESPN. Not a mention of Lillard (except that he passed to Batum at the end). What's up with that ESPN? He had 24, 11 and 6 and pretty much single handedly brought the Blazers back twice. But he doesn't get a single highlight?
671niners::u have to be in NY, LA, and MIA to get a highlight.
nick243243::Why was the foul called to send gee to the free throw line at the end? there should have been a no call. They shouldn't have had no shot to win that game.
wtfiuwts::Is anyone else weirded out by YenxRenx? If Cleveland sucks so bad, why are you trolling their boards? Wizards fan?
epitome1986::how is dion waiters shooting 37% for the season? it seems every game he shoots 4-20 3-17 i have yet to see him in a boxscore higher then 30%
PhilMNAP::Dion Waiters is a beast.
Kobelies247::Good game Portland! Im a fan again :)
35Jordan::So how about the nic Batum!
DucksRUNpac12-v2.0::Tough year for the Blazers......its only going to get worse.
Kobelies247::Pretty much but atleast we know its coming unlike the last 4 years
Kobelies247::okok im joking hehe
ClydeTheGlide_22::Blazers undefeated in OT this season
sky high3::I feel like the blazers are always in OT
SGO DucksnBlazers::Unlike so many previous seasons when we couldn't win an OT game
YaImFromCleveland::Tank you very much, Portland
nbafanatic69::Geez, wish I could have watched this tight game.
blazerfan0714::Gritty win tonight Blazers!! Cavs played tough it's too bad Kyrie was out. Blazers bench played well tonight, probably the best thus far this season. Good win for this young team!!
Qzhoopin20::Why is Luke Walton still in the NBA??
angelrod1977_banned2::He's the weed dispensor for the NBA!! Oregon is the greenist out there!
Kobelies247::Batum shows up one time out of the last 6 games and hes a hero! LOL  Worth 48mill??  HELLLL NOOOOO  Grats Blazer fans, you earned it!!
eototalt::"You're Welcome!" - David Kahn
ClydeTheGlide_22::Did you change your avatar? Almost didn't recognize you there!
angelrod1977_banned2::Look at his stats fool. I think he's doing just fine after his contract extention. If Portland had a bench that wasn't full of first time Euros and rookies then he probably would be even more efficient. Nice try though Top 5 Portland troll (at least you are dedicated to your lame craft).
Rip_City27::Averaging 19 points a game, honestly thats a steal for 4 years 46 mil, in 2 years he will be worth more than that..
Kobelies247::In 2 years Portland wont have enough fans to afford him,,,,
DISandDAT6::He was playing well in the first 10 games or so. Both Lillard and Batum have been struggling on this road trip. Well the whole team.
DISandDAT6::Yes it is quite sad.... Aldridge seems to be soft this year
Kobelies247::Sad when your best player is your rookie huh?
T.O.G.M.S.17::dammit. cant believe i missed this game. looks like the game of the year so far. Cavs just gotta keep playin hard. im shocked how we coulda won every single game since Kyrie got hurt. we gotta play this hard all the time. I can see Dion definitely needs Kyrie back. Good game Blazers. best of luck rest of the year.
Steel_Smack::Lots of class here.... /sarcasm
YenxRenx::they are young because anyone with any experience just wants to get the heck outta Cleveland, just ask LeBron. If any of the current Cavs ever get good and learn how to play team basketball , they'll be out of Cleveland in a flash too! Cleveland hasn't won a WS, SB or NBA title in 64 years. Everyone knows you can't win in Cleveland
YenxRenx::"coulda won"....the favorite words of cavs fans everywhere are "coulda, woulda,shoulda, mighta,oughta,gonna, wanna"....why don't you simply accept the Cavs for what they are and focus on what they actually "did"?
T.O.G.M.S.17::they ARE a young and inexperienced and a team lacking depth. The DID play a hard fought game. hell they played a bunch of hard fought games this season just need to learn how to close
blazers_0531::hello guys! don't mind kobelies247 and roymullins! good game for both teams! keep it up Cavs and Blazers!
YenxRenx::Keep what up? losing?
ClydeTheGlide_22::LOL this from a Jets fan. Nice.
DISandDAT6::Effort
Tonytouch24kt::Nice win Blazers, after a disappointing first couple of games on the road trip, you guys put together an awesome double overtime win. Couldn't be prouder even tho it was over my home town squad. Go Zers!
YenxRenx::Yeah, nice job by the Blazers tonight. In the CAVS HOUSE!!!!!! Oh Yeah!!!
katx5h::Varejao is playing out of his mind right now! Too bad he's on this Cleveland squad...
YenxRenx::Yep, Varejao's selfish ballhog play casts the illusion that he is a positive force. In reality, both Varejao and Irving's selfish play hurts the Cavs. Whatever their individual numbers are they would be more effective as balanced players in a total team game.
initialX::put him in any other top title contender and he get you 7 rebs and 9 pts
HunterF4444::YenxRenx has trolled Cavs boards all year...he's the only troll we have. That alone should tell you that you have problems.
YenxRenx::I guess you folks can't handle the truth.....that's sad.... Why would you flag me? I've never flagged any of you.
DrawohWasHere::Just keep flagging the despicable troll.   Soon, at least she'll have to choose another name.
YenxRenx::I've never trolled and I've never bashed the Cavs. I stick to the absolute truth in all that I say.
Rip City Forever::U may think that...at times..but don't lie, u know when ur are trolling...
HunterF4444::You live a sad, sad life.
Rip City Forever::That's like Kobelies for us. I'm not sure he has a favorite team. Just a favorite team to hate
YenxRenx::Never hated any team. The thing with Cavs fans is that they insist on claiming their team/franchise is one of the greats. I think we all know that isn't true.
JrueRandallHoliday::I'm stunned... Waiters only took 17 shots tonight!
DrawohWasHere::why not complain about Zeller having a double/double?
Kobelies247::This win so doesnt make up for the fact you lost to the WIZ!!!
Rip City Forever::No tranny either just probably gay
Kobelies247::How old are you?
Rip City Forever::No Kobelies would be just straight gay no bisexual at all just straight gay
Rip City Forever::Yes worse then him! They might be gay together I think
jaredb3319::Watch the use of words loser or you will be flagged
DrawohWasHere::What if they're both SheMales from Miami?
angelrod1977_banned2::Thats a lot of laptop love I didn't want to picture....thanks for the mental pic Rip.
CELTICBLAZER05::he should coach the Cavs LOL
angelrod1977_banned2::Here's one of Portlands top trolls....yaaaaaa for you.
Rip City Forever::^^^^look out for this guy cavs fan. Lol. Biggest troll to ever come across a board
YenxRenx::god, i hate trolls. people should be like me and always tell the truth on these boards. I hate delusional HOMERS too.....
angelrod1977_banned2::Ya he's a big D-Ba.g for sure.
DrawohWasHere::worse than YenxBenx or whatever her name is?
Rock Lancaster::Yenx - Pseudobulbar affect (PBA), emotional lability, labile affect or emotional incontinence refers to a neurologic disorder characterized by involuntary crying or uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays.[1] PBA occurs secondary to neurologic disease or brain injury.  Get some help and medication
TRHMC1::I concur. The picture of some sloppy geek giggling at his keyboard because some random fan base likes their team is a little disturbing young man. Seek some help.  Smokingstogies, eat a dick.
smokinstogies305::Rust and dust and 2 ugly buildings.
orange_63::RESPECT THE CLEVELAND FAN, WE ARE DIE HARD, TRULY WORLD-CLASS #1FANS..........good night!
Rip City Forever::Quit hatin dude
smokinstogies305::Every time I get to Cleveland I get sad.
YenxRenx::Everytime I go to Cleveland i laugh my $@% off!!
smokinstogies305::Sometimes its sunny out, but its usually cold and gray and rusty.
YenxRenx::no, you are delusional
smokinstogies305::Pro sports hate Cleveland.
YenxRenx::its been 64 years since a CLE team won a WS, SB or NBA title....don't hold your breath
DrawohWasHere::You'd be wrong.
DrawohWasHere::just going through a tough time right now.    We'll be back sooner than you can say "LeBron wants out of Miami".
smarty70885::YenxRenx are you blind, stupid, or just unable to afford a tv?
Rip City Forever::I hope yenrex isn't a blazer fan...
DrawohWasHere::Or too lazy to be a master over his domain.   if you know what I mean.
YenxRenx::no comedy channel makes me laugh as much as "diehard Cavs fans". I have a few real nice TV's, but this stuff takes the cake!!
YenxRenx::This may just be THE FUNNIEST thread on ESPN. Cavs fans claiming their 4-13 team is a worldbeater....too funny. I get  stitches from laughing....just too friggin FUNNY!!!
TRHMC1::NERD! NERD! NERD! NERD!
Rock Lancaster::Still laughing at the keyboard.  Get out more simpleton.  Don't you have homework to do?
DrawohWasHere::The Cavaliers will be turning the corner and back to NBA contention soon enough.    Can't wait to see Kyrie back on the floor especially now that both waiters and zeller have taken a huge step forward in their rook season.  Just wondering when the last time the NBA had b2b ROYs?
jasomo::zeller wont get ROY lilliard will
YenxRenx::ROY doesn't mean squat. in kyrie's case it meant a .320 record...hahahahahha
DrawohWasHere::Since LeBron's team was worse, in your mind, LeBron James is a worse player.
yata-9arasu::Good game Blazers and good luck this year!  We will see you guys in the Rose Garden....  Good night and last but not least....  GO CAVS!!!  Sigh................  P.S.- Lillard is a stud.
Rip City Forever::Likewise to u Cleveland! Appreciate that u guys just don't troll all the time (like Minnesota) and good luck this season!
angelrod1977_banned2::We needed a draft pick that actually worked out badly....thanks man.
DrawohWasHere::Lillard has done a good job so far.
Rock Lancaster::2 bad teams in a very entertaining game
49ersGoat::I don't remember seeing mdr2855 during the game.  But now that the Blazers have safely won, he's talking more trash than anyone.  I'm a Blazer fan but I hate trolls  Good game Cavs, good luck this season.
angelrod1977_banned2::I tend to come in at the end cause I don't usually post during the game if I'm watching it on my TV....but youre right....us Portland fans have no crap to talk anyway.
angelrod1977_banned2::Unless I watch it on the computer....then I'm on the trash talk depending if Portland has a lead for a change. I just can't stand the gambler comments....they are fools.
DrawohWasHere::I usually don't come in until after as well as we watch the game as a family and think it's rude to be typing on a computer while watching a game.
DrawohWasHere::most of these trolls are LeBron James fans.    They simply can't get over it.  Best wishes to you and your team.  Go Cavaliers!
caparzo5::Good game everyone. Was fun chatting with you blazer fans tonight. Trolls and fake fans are here now, gotta go. Night!
Rip City Forever::Good game guys! Until we meet again!
yata-9arasu::Good night!  :)  GO CAVS!
mdr2855::Blazers needed this win!! Whew...against a crappy Cavs team, even better
TRHMC1::Be honest, if 3-4 clearly bad calls went against you instead of for you in crunchtime, you'd be making the same points. Good win for the Blazers, every win is good. Doesn't change the facts...
angelrod1977_banned2::I've seen it many times but all the complaints don't change the W to an L ya know. Refs are humans and we should expect mistakes more than less.
TRHMC1::Triple overtime W on a fluke shot, in a game that the refs gift wrappped vs a team without its best player. GO BLAZERS!!!! #thumbsup
angelrod1977_banned2::When have the refs ever been perfect in a game? Seriously. The shot was what won it, nothing else (better defense would of been a win for the Cavs, or that missed free throw).
49ersGoat::It's better that we beat a crappy team instead of beating a good team?
DrawohWasHere::We just beat a +.500 game last night.    b2b.
DrawohWasHere::7-10 isn't crappy?
DrawohWasHere::gift wrapped game against a 4-13 team.
mdr2855::4-13 is awesome, you should be proud!!
angelrod1977_banned2::Portland actually has the best starting 5 in the whole league (look it up). They just don't have a bench.....AT ALL.
Rip_City27::Better than the Cavs right?
Jon Gruden..Please Come To The Vols::you're mental
Doug Bollinger 1::Hey guys, who was watching the game in the first half? The last shot before half time, was that block DEFINITLY a goal tend?  Thanks
yata-9arasu::It was a goaltend......
mdr2855::waaaaaahhhhhh
DrawohWasHere::Yes
DrawohWasHere::but not counted as such
sodatennis::Can't wait for us to trade Varejao! Geez it's inevitable especially being a Cavs fan. We have to trade everyone.
YenxRenx::Hixson blocking Varejao's ill-concived shot in the final seconds of regulation is the reason the Cavs lost. Varejao lacked the intelligence to dish the ball. Typical. varejao wanted the points for himself cause hes a selfish player.
caparzo5::hahaha Yenx has no life
DrawohWasHere::NBA rules = .02 you can't dish the ball.     I'd expect this from a dumb troll like you.
sodatennis::I don't think there is anyone who could do what Varejao does for the Cavs. He's the heart and soul of the team
DrawohWasHere::agree
DrawohWasHere::Grant has made some great decisions.   If the Wild THing is traded, it'll be for someone that'll make the team better.
DrawohWasHere::No, Anderson is Wild Thing.   He has since he came to the Cavaliers.   I have the first Wild Thing wig and am wearing it right now.
49ersGoat::Wild Thing
DrawohWasHere::Who's Charlie Sheen?
49ersGoat::Isn't Charlie Sheen the Wild Thing?
Jon Gruden..Please Come To The Vols::YenxRenx, why are you here? You're a fan of neither team?   You should be worried about the Jets getting blown out by the Cardinals tomorrow
Jdferg306::Tebow!
Clutch Three::I actually like Cards' chances tomorrow against the Jets
YenxRenx::Im a fan of the truth
smarty70885::^he put jets, winning, and superbowl in the same sentence haha
Jon Gruden..Please Come To The Vols::So you know the Jets aren't winning the Superbowl like Rex Ryan promised?
yata-9arasu::Oh look....  His comments are gone.....  What a surprise.....
TRHMC1::Nah, just a lonely nerd.
YenxRenx::somebody has to counter Cavs fans claims that they are a great team..lol
angelrod1977_banned2::The life of some trolls.....
DrawohWasHere::Honestly don't know why anyone would want to hang out on a thread of a team you don't like.   Every day, every week.
yata-9arasu::I know.  Probably a Cleveland fan...
Rock Lancaster::Cavs will be in playoffs before POR
angelrod1977_banned2::Portland should have a decent bench next season....no way will the Cavs be better. But like mentioned above...It's easier in the East to make it.
49ersGoat::In the East, you can get in with 35 wins.  Big accomplishment.
Rock Lancaster::Still an accurate statement
YenxRenx::just like "The Cavs will win a title before LeBron"....hahahahah remember that one?
smarty70885::Oh and look at how much closer you guys have gotten to winning one too :)
Rip_City27::Comedian you are??
Rock Lancaster::At least I know how to ask a question
Rip_City27::Maybe for you
Rock Lancaster::Rip - then it would be "are you a comedian?"
Rip_City27::I was actually asking bud
Rock Lancaster::That was a statement not a question.  May want to re-write it
Rip City Forever::Rip cityyyyyyyy!!!!!! $@%! yeah!!!!
mdr2855::yeah!!!!!!!!!!
smarty70885::Lol David Stern's a Blazers fan hahaha
angelrod1977_banned2::I've been a Portland fan (born and raised here) all my life....Stern probably sees what us OG fans see....the town loves our team and we hope that one day we get a team like the Kersey, Porter, Drexler...days!
YenxRenx::Cavs fans should have known that something was up when irving was "Charity ROY" after a .320 performance....other rookies like Norris Cole won a title. they felt sorry for the Cavs and gave a bogus award to Kyrie the LOSAH!!! hahahahahahahahaha
smarty70885::Kyrie was ranked 22 best player in the NBA after his rookie season, go check the rankings now, so you can keep your mouth shut right now
49ersGoat::Norris Cole was instrumental to that title run.  Seriously GTFO
HunterF4444::Shut up
DrawohWasHere::just flag the troll hunter
Jon Gruden..Please Come To The Vols::mdr2855 Go Blazers!! (Cavs SUCK) ----------------------------------  I know you aint talking.......yall lost to the $@%!$@% Wizards...THE WIZARDS!!
mdr2855::Y'all suck
LongSufferingBrownsFan::Only one team has lost to them so far....
sworthin117::someones got to be the first
sworthin117::A lot of teams will lose to the wizards... including the cavs
Jon Gruden..Please Come To The Vols::And we'll beat em again
sworthin117::how many times do you play them this season?  This isnt football
Rip_City27::And play them again
DrawohWasHere::Looks like Jon got pwned
Jon Gruden..Please Come To The Vols::we already beat them
Rip_City27::Records dont lie
49ersGoat::Damien Lillard: 24 pts, 11 assists, 6 rebounds  Kind of looks like a Rubio line, except the points
mdr2855::Lillard is in his own class...can't compare him to anyone else (btw Nash is OLD &amp; done!!)
Rip_City27::Steve Nash
carrollofbrandon::Juwan Howard could be on the cavs and Campie would still call him a 'young man'
DrawohWasHere::Campie could be on the Cavs and I'd still call him young man.
Clutch Three::How much longer is Kyrie's rook contract? I bet you he'll want to leave too...
Clutch Three::I can really see him going somewhere like Dallas or Atlanta
DrawohWasHere::Why?
YenxRenx::he'd ahve to get good before anyone would want him. there isnt much of a market for .200 players
kardiackid11::two seasons after this one but then he is a RFA
sworthin117::He will only leave if he doesnt was to be The Man anymore
YenxRenx::you mean the "LOSERMAN"
mdr2855::Go Blazers!! (Cavs SUCK)
jeetz56::oh no is this breaking news cuz i want to lol 2. stupid.
ctown8686::Portland picked Bowie over Jordan, then followed it up by picking Oden over Durant, LOL
yata-9arasu::Cavs let him??????????????  REALLY???????
49ersGoat::followed it up?  You missed where they set an NBA record with consecutive playoff appearances.
mdr2855::...and Cavs let LeBrick take his talents to South Beach
Jdferg306::And Cavs are 4-13?
Rock Lancaster::POR is 7 - 10 fool
Rock Lancaster::3 games behind POR with 65 to go. You will be watching the Cavs in the playoffs before POR
mdr2855::Cavs are...? Fool
HunterF4444::Guys...this is a blessing in disguise. Close losses are probably for the best this year. We need one more draft...
LongSufferingBrownsFan::I'd rather they learn to close out games, frankly.
YenxRenx::LOL..thats what you folks said last year..and the year before and the year before and the year before and the year before....
Rock Lancaster::You are laughing out loud alot tonight.  Must be a sorry life to sit at a computer laughing like a clown while typing. lol
yata-9arasu::$@%! YOU!  How did we say that when we had LeBron James???????
DrawohWasHere::true.    Or one good FA to go along with this fine cast of young players.
Rock Lancaster::Couldn't agree more.  Have some cap room too
YenxRenx::The Detroit Pissed-Ons are actually BETTER than the cavs....lol!!!
smarty70885::See in Portland, they don't get wins, or good players, very often, so we should let them have this one
DrawohWasHere::I'm honored you spend 24/7/365 with the Cavaliers.   shows respect you have for our great organization
