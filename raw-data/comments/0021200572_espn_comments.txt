JLJR1154::Why the NETS lost. 3 starters D-Will, Johnson and Bogans shot 9-39 (23%) rest of team 28-48 (58%). The majority of the shots were jump shots (4-26 3's). Lopez 10-14. I have now been able to get a good look at Joe Johnson's game. Does he have something against using the glass? All his shots are jump shots 20-25 ft or floaters in the lane. He gets too passive at times. Don't he know that he was brought in to score?
nba is the worst::The evidence continues to show that the Hawks are better without Josh
moosiphoosus::1 game against the NETS and you say this bs...come on son!
AllInForLife1984::I started betting with this online system called Sportsbettingstar.  Ive made around 3K per month for 3 straight months just by using the system.
KnicksGiantsYankeesRangers::nets suck.. its not even funny
TheAvenger007::Nets are horrendy rend
blue2ballers::for the guys who said trading humphries for dwight howard would be a terrible move. what is your opinion now that they lost. Still the same, I think not
I3UTTON::lol Nets are garbage
Hondo Kid::About time hawks won against a decent? Team.   Seems nets and hawks both play hot and cold.
NYballer6969::I mentioned way before the game started ,the Hawks will play much better w/o Josh Smith in the game. Josh Smith at .439 for a power forward is a complete joke , especially when his team collectively shoot much better then him . With Josh Smith in the game , people have to stop their game to make sure that Gangsta Josh gets his required 1 touch every 2 times down the court , then the ill-fated 18 foot jumper clanks off the rim . Hawk fans demand to get Gasol for Smith , while Gasol's value is down !
nba is the worst::Why would the lakers do that?
NYballer6969::Why is Jerry Stackhouse even being used ? He hasn't looked good in a game since the first Knick game ! He is not quick enough to get back on D , if Deron decides to drive to the hole . He was like 10 feet away from Korver off a screen . If they want him to inspire the young Nets , let him be the 13th guy on the bench ! For that matter , when was the last time Joe Johnson was back on D to stop a fast break ? There is a reason why he never breaks a sweat !
mugupo::Josh is definite most overrated star, just look the hawk.
moosiphoosus::Who rated Josh a star?  Definitely not his Atlanta Fans...i mean his ATL faithful fans can't stand him.  They will fill up a quote box with his cons but will have 2 pros listed.  They fail to remember when Joe and Al was out last yr, Josh was the guy who won games for us.  Sure he has anger issues and needed a suspension.  Let's see how he plays post conduct suspension.
Neil826::hey nets, this hawks team just lost by 40 points to a team playing without their best player, it should have been an easy win.  pathetic.
Snakes222::Hey Deron! STOP SHOOTING!
Snitchy Cent::could the nets be going down in a slump again!?.
Ontario925::After the Nets last loss before this game against the Spurs the same comment was made.
Ontario925::Is this loss only a brief hiccup for the Nets or will they return to the coach Avery Johnson pre Christmas Nets?
IPITYTH3F00L::Still don't understand why Bogans and Watson consistently get more minutes than Brooks. They are turrible.
markpringle2003::When does Josh get traded?
Ontario925::The last time the Knicks won a playoff series Patrick Ewing was still playing for them. I believe that was in the Spring of 2000. Then he leaves after that Postseason for Seattle. Great idiot owner James Dolan is.
Jrunes520::Sorry, I had to
Jrunes520::The nets are as for real as manti's girlfriend
Kerby5436::yes we are bad!!! dolan needs to stop that....seriously. but it sounds like how the nets played defense tonight
Ontario925::The difference is the Nets are not supposed to look great now. The Knicks with team owner Dolan's brilliant 5 year plan back to a Championship series in 2010 does not look so brilliant now.
Ontario925::The Jets make NY look bad.
Kerby5436::truth
Kerby5436::jets have won in the last 7 years not the nets 7-46
Ontario925::The Jets won in the last 7 years? Stop living in the past Kerby. Take your advice.
Hmarko90::the jets are a circus. the nets got their $@%! together and they have an owner who wants to win and doesnt sing for a $@%!$@ country band he named after himself. although that would be hilarious: ladies and gentlemen we present pokaraf and the cowboys
Kerby5436::im ajets fan too so i feel painnnnnnnn
Hmarko90::i too am a jets fan so heed my words: jets don't have a chance to be top dog, nets do.
Jrunes520::As a jets fan, I'm used to being a 2nd class team in my own town. Nets fan, acceptance is the first step
Kerby5436::and u made me spell just wrong
Ontario925::The Knicks won two or three Postseason series in 2000 before Ewing departed. Don't blame every other team fans because the Dolans are horrible owners. Isiah Thomas? lol
Hmarko90::ok so lets talk about the present: the knicks suck.
Kerby5436::stop living in the past
Kerby5436::they jest changed last year 9 10 no difference bud
Hmarko90::two words: isaiah thomas
Hmarko90::at least the nets didn't hold the shittiest franchise in the nba belt for like a decade
sources says::They battled for the worst NBA record ever a couple times within the last decade
Kerby5436::you are right sir nets havent since 03 big deal
islesfan93::no nets won a playoff series in 07 so you sir are wrong
Jrunes520::"The Nets are the only remaining NBA team who have not lost a game against any below .500 W-L teams."  So they beat the bad teams and stink against good ones? Seems like a contender to me.    Not even in the top half of attendance either? sounds like bandwagoners to me.
Porkchop8920::The Nets have one of the highest attendance percentages though, and you have to beat the bad teams before you can beat the good teams
Jrunes520::Because I ran out of manti te'o jokes
Hmarko90::if you're not a hawks fan then what are you doing here?
DPetro10::So pj you have the best player on the team or one of the at least and you put him on the bench when you team is down 11 why?
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Hawks go from 58 points to 109 points ....can't figure this team out
Rezo201::Think Pats hurry up offense.
Rezo201::The Nets played no defense, literally. It was like watching a team run sprints up and down the court. The Nets had no energy from the first quarter on.
Hmarko90::i don't think the nets did anything tonight....
Hmarko90::to all you knick fans who are trollin' this board: at least the nets aren't a nursing home.
farhanx20786::Yo ontario925 last time i checked the knicks beat the nets twice once in our home second in your home where we had MVP MVP MVP chants for MELO.
Ontario925::Yes.
Hmarko90::remember last year when the knicks dropped balloons when they finally won a playoff GAME
Kerby5436::Hmarko90 - remember when the knicks watched the nets go to two finals?  remember when the knicks were the shittiest run franchise in basketball. i can do this all day.  2002 i was 19
Hmarko90::remember when the knicks watched the nets go to two finals?  remember when the knicks were the shittiest run franchise in basketball. i can do this all day.
Kerby5436::rememeber the nets watched
Ontario925::Remember also when the Knicks lost to the Pacers before the hot Pacers lost to the Nets?
Kerby5436::we beat them first
Kerby5436::rockin wins dog rockin wins i told u raptors suck
Kerby5436::Hmarko90 - A) no they aren't B) when did the nets lost to the hornets?  true wrong fan lol
Hmarko90::A) no they aren't B) when did the nets lost to the hornets?
Kerby5436::Hmarko90 - remember when the knicks lost to the kings.  better than hornets
Hmarko90::remember when the knicks lost to the kings.
Ontario925::The Nets are not ready for rocking chairs yet like the Grandpa Knicks.
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::no we are not lol must be someone else
Kerby5436::Hmarko90 - i love melo but he is the most enigmatic player not named rondo. he's only good when he wants to and i dont want a player like that on my team.  thats why u dont and you lost to a team we just destroyed
Hmarko90::i love melo but he is the most enigmatic player not named rondo. he's only good when he wants to and i dont want a player like that on my team.
Kerby5436::Hmarko90 - yea but at least it isn't the other way around  carmelo is better than half ya roster really
Hmarko90::yea but at least it isn't the other way around
Kerby5436::two of ya starters are old as hell ya young guys other than rondo suck
Kerby5436::nurse the loss we win without ours nurse that
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::lol
Kerby5436::u lol yall are one foot in the grave ya selves
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::Robin Lopez killed us today
Rezo201::Brook's per is 6th in the entire NBA and he averages 29 minutes a game. Let's just leave him on the bench half of the game.
Hmarko90::lol i know, and blatche isn't the greatest player he's to selfish and it isnt even adorabel selfish like nick young and jr smith.
Hmarko90::yea, there were like three or four possessions in the second i cant remember if it was consecutive but all he did was dribble and pull up jumper. he got one.
Rezo201::I agree, at times I have no idea what Blatche is doing. He plays like a 2 guard with all the dribbling he does.
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::???
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::dammit wen the Nets finally lose, we lose
Kerby5436::hope the same for brady!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hmarko90::badly
Hmarko90::sully
Hmarko90::just making sure you know. oh and they got outrebounded....again. why don't they start
Celtics_Red Sox_Pats_Mavs::thanks for rubbing it in
Rezo201::If Brook got normal minutes that a 24 year old starter gets he would average 25 and 10 with one arm.
Hmarko90::can we discuss one thing that bothers the hell out of me: why doesn't marshon brooks get more playing time????? why is pj still playing stackhouse and bogans????
Kerby5436::hes garbage
Hmarko90::what about tele? he didn't play enough after showing up in toronto
Hmarko90::he doesn't play defense worse than stackhouse...
Rezo201::His defense is offensive to say the least and he plays out of control at times.
Rezo201::D-Will the last 2 games played 78 minutes, Brook played 53...
Lemuel7043::gtg. watching the future. irving vs lillard
Rezo201::The fact that at 24 our best player (Lopez) doesn't even get to play 30 minutes a game is a joke. Tim Duncan is like 56 and averages more minutes a game than Lopez! He's 24, man.
Ontario925::I'm wondering if PJ is conservative in saving Lopez for the Postseason. He doesn't want to risk having key players burned out or seriously injured before the Postseason begins.
Hmarko90::yea i know but i feel if lopez would play more minutes he would lose a leg.
littlemac1331::Come on, where's Mike Scott's pt?
Hmarko90::you mean marshon brooks?
Texans_Knicks_2008::I am posting this at 9:26 CT, but it says 2 hours ago?
Lemuel7043::a time traveler?!!!!!!!!! on ESPN????
Hmarko90::you've entered....the twilight zone.
Hmarko90::one thing that is bothering me with this loss is how atl ran the nets out of the gym. the reason why i'm worried is because the nets is 29th in pace. i don't think the nets would do well vs teams that run
Hmarko90::why? i'm not a hawks fan... and besides they've advanced to the second round a couple of times...
djny2k12::You should be worried about why the Hawks always fail to get out of the 1st round
Mets2410::Oh yeah one last thing, regardless of Nets Hawks (and JJ Lou) talk, go Falcons $@%! the 9ers
Hmarko90::9ers gonna win. unless falcons pull off their patented "pulling a win out of their $@%"
Texans_Knicks_2008::In other news, Deron Williams continues his efforts to shoot below 40% this season
Porkchop8920::In other news D-Will shooting 46% since PJ became coach...
Mets2410::In other news, Knicks continue efforts to make playoffs and hopefully win their first playoff series since the 99-2000 season.
Hmarko90::more insane things have happened.....
Kerby5436::ok i just got home i know im late but u guys really suck now 58 point hawks??????
Ontario925::Created profile in Oct 2012 saying suck to a profile created Apr 2008 and calling them the NJ Nets. Is that the best I.Q. you have? lol
Kerby5436::nj nets all over again
Ontario925::Keep waiting for team owner James Dolan to put a Knicks team together that will bring them back to an NBA Championship series for the first time since 1999.
Hmarko90::and even that one was a fluke.
Kerby5436::keep waiting
Hmarko90::can't wait till they drop one vs the pistons. i see it comin'
Ontario925::I'm not saying you are a Knicks fan but your comment looks like one from a Knicks fan relishing this one loss by the Nets. Typical trolls comment a team sucks even if it is one loss in 10 games.
Kerby5436::ontario as in canada....raptors suck stay over the border
Hmarko90::u trollin'?
falconsfan0125::Checking in on the Hawks. This is a big week for the Falcons so the Hawks are an after thought. Good to see they won. GO Hawks and Go Falcons!
Hmarko90::atl fans only show up if their teams are good and even then they barely show up.
aftern9ne::Thanks for the input, bro.
Ontario925::The verdict is out. PJ is better than Avery Johnson as coach. Avery Johnson was the Nets Mike D'Antoni.
Mets2410::Last thing I'm saying about Lou and JJ. For the Hawks, given their circumstances, Lou is better. For the Nets, given their circumstances, JJ is better.  Good game Hawks fans see you guys Friday in BK
Dikembe_Mutombo_Throwback_ATLanta_Hawks_Jersey::Expect the same 4 for 15 16 17 or whatever the hell Joe Johnson shot tonight for the playoffs nets fans. The only difference is he wont get to the line 7 times, let alone go 7-7 from the free throw line to pad his stats.
djny2k12::Horrible reasoning? How so? Nets didn't give up anything significant for Joe Johnson. Nets were going to spend money regardless....and plus HAWKS gave him the contract.
Min4554::A horrible reasoning. $124 million for a 2nd tier guy? I'm not pissed at JJ for signing the deal but the Nets took on a overpaid 2nd star????? Does anyone in their right mind think D. Wade is getting $124 million bucks? I think not. Also if D. Will and B. Lopez are option 1 and 2, then isn't getting JJ even worse because he's your 3rd option now? Man this is getting too easy to ridicule.
Mets2410::Yes the Nets took an overpaid 2nd star. Why? Because they were already over the cap. The money does not mean anything to them! Getting JJ was not preventing them from adding anybody meaningful to the team. He was the best SG (easily the Nets worst position last year) they could get so they did it.
Lemuel7043::yep. pretty unusual he got 7 fta
djny2k12::Hawks relied on Joe Johnson as their main guy....brooklyn has Deron Williams and Brook Lopez. Joe fits in perfectly as the 2nd star.
djny2k12::One thing I'd like to point out is Evans cannot be a starter....he is perfect off the bench. Atleast playing off the bench, Evans is playing against the 2nd unit. He is offensively challenged and is a turnover waiting to happen everytime he is in the post on offense.
Ontario925::The Hawks are not a bad team. They are a good team. If they were in the West Conference right now they would be 6th seed above the Rockets. 6th seed in the West Conference standards is a good team.
BKNets123456::1st lost all year
whiteytheoldman1::Now thats the Hawks team I remember seein this season! Way to play D and share the ball. Back on track.
Min4554::I'm a huge Hawks fan but would love to see J. Smith traded for picks and maybe a player or 2. He's uber talented and a load to guard but having said the settles for the 15-18 foot jump shot? OMG pains me to watch him sometimes. What happened to attack the rim and get to the line and exert his dominance. Hawks are better off without him
sector47::Notice how it happened with Josh Smith glued to the bench. Surprise.
ThePhinsPhan-::its alright, we so got monday night in the bag
Hmarko90::does this show that the nets aren't for real or is just a hiccup?
djny2k12::Nets are 5th in the league in ppg allowed....so yes they can defend. Hawks were desperate for a win and Nets were playing off an emotional win on a back to back. Also, no one runs up and down the floor in the playoffs. It's all half court basketball. Much more suitable to how the Nets play.
Hmarko90::listen, i am a level headed fan but there was more to that game then just "bad game" two reason this loss happened. 1) they were tired or 2) they can't defend fast paced teams because they are a slow plodding team. they are 29th in pace!
Min4554::Ummm 4-5 seed in the east and maybe a upset in the 1st round but championship? Hell no!  Does anyone think the Nets are better than the Heat, Celtics, knicks or even the bulls or hell the Hawks. Don't think so
Hmarko90::i just want to get this str8: knicks suck.
BKNets123456::?
Hmarko90::did you watch the game? it was pretty embarrassing.
BKNets123456::sorry the Nets could not get the 10 game win streak. It's the first game they lost this year relax
Mets2410::just because a team loses by double digits doesn't mean they aren't for real. Nets smoked OKC in OKC while playing the worst stretch of basketball they had been for the entire season (similar to the Hawks tonight). Doesn't mean OKC isn't for real.
Mets2410::because the Nets lost they aren't for real? c'mon
Ontario925::Perhaps a hiccup. Every top team in the NBA now has already gone on at least a 3 game slump this season. Even the Heat and Thunder. The Nets are the only remaining NBA team who have not lost a game against any below .500 W-L teams.
Jrunes520::So they beat the bad teams and stink against good ones? Seems like a contender to me.  Not even in the top half of attendance either? sounds like bandwagoners to me.
Lemuel7043::Good old days when Joe Cool used to average 25,5 and 5
Ontario925::It's the referees fault we got swept by both of them -Knicks fans after losing 2 games in a row to both the Rockets and Bulls
12.21.12::That's so funny, sir.
JLJR1154::Lopez 10-14, JJ and D-Will combined 9-33 majority jump shots. JJ and D-Will both bigger and stronger than Teague and Harris. What ever happened to post up and going to the basket? Give the ball to Lopez.
Hmarko90::i think it was because they were tired.
UGA_Dawgz_90::Joe Johnson plays nearly 10 mins more a game than Lou Williams but averages the same assist per game, only 1 more rebound per game even though he's 6 inches taller....and only 2.7 more points a game, despite being a starter and costing about 5x more money.   Lou &gt; Joe
Min4554::Oh yeah i forgot about their sorry $@%!$ and their bloated contracts. :)
kevincruz58::dont 4get the gwallace and humpries bad contracts aswell as brooks max deal nets cap space is done!
Min4554::well when one guy is making 5 million and the other 20 million does it matter which one you want? YES! The cheaper option. Not to mention with Deron Williams contract and JJ the Nets will never be able to sign the complimentary players needed to win a championship
hj60BKNOAK::That. Atl dope must be pretty good..that's straight rubbish u talkin
UGA_Dawgz_90::Yeah, because paying a guy 5x more money and playing him 10 more mins a game, but he gives you the same rebounds and assists per game...and only 2.7 more PPG makes a lot of sense lol.
Mets2410::You'll say no, but I'm sure if given the option to have Joe or Lou Williams at the same contract any NBA GM would say give me Joe
Mets2410::what I'm trying to say and have been trying to say while you guys rip on Joe is that for the Hawks given their circumstances, Lou is the better option. For the Nets, given their circumstances, Joe is the better player.
UGA_Dawgz_90::that's the problem....the contracts ARE different, but those numbers are 100% facts.
