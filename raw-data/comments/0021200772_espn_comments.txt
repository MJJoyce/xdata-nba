columbozim::Why is Durant trying to push this whole "I'm hard" act. Everyone knows its an act (he's even acted in a commercial trying to promote it) and he just looks dumb. You can't all of a sudden be hard, especially with that stick-figure body. Danny Devito could destroy Kevin Durant.
westcoast8691::Yup OKC is in trouble. When the Jazz destroy you who just lost to Sacramento you know the Dynasty is offically over before it ever begun with letting Harden go...
4 Petes Sake::I want to say congratulations to the Jazz.  also I know some clowns will lump me in, I don't predict wins and losses.  on to Miami.
sfurse77::I love how all day yesterday all you OKC fans said that you would be blowing out the Jazz and your starters would be able to sit the whole 4th quarter. Funny you were right about one thing. Your starters got some rest at the end. But it's cause YOU were getting blown out! #Jazznation
ddd007ddd::IS THIS STREAK A NEW NORMAL 4 LBJ?................if it is,d scoring champ title in jeopardy4 KD
bigzepfan::Jazz Fan here. Another Fluke Win by the Jazz. They get about 5 or 6 every year and then get run off the court by average teams most of the season as they exit the playoffs in the first round. Perennial decent team in a decent city in a decent arena. They will NEVER get a ring.
RicanBuc49::"They will NEVER get a ring."  Why thank you Ms.Cleo  What a tool lol smh
NYeltigre::Thought the flagrant 1 on KD was a good call but under todays rules, he should have been tossed.
boardorbust::Well we know if someone did that Durant they would have been tossed which is about al l you need to know.
sfurse77::I don't think KD should have been tossed. But Perkins is a cheap shot bitc h. He should have been tossed for his elbow on jefferson.
boardorbust::I agree.  Perkins move was the more dangerous.  The point of his elbow hits Jefferson in the temple and you have a serious issue.  Fortunately it didn't but from the front angle it was very flagrant and borders a flagrant 2 I would say.
BANKROBBA2020::Jazz will lose tomorrow night @ Minnesota...then all this excitement over beating OKC will be forgotten.
CFESPORTS::OKC Poor Sport Loser ^^^
RicanBuc49::False
Whittinghamscalves::^^^ Debbie Downer
boardorbust::Funny how Durant says "they would have done the same thing to me" about his body check on Burks.  Really?  If anyone would have made a play like that on Durant with absolutely no play on the ball like he did they would have been ejected and called all kinds of unprofessional things.  Because it was Durant they had to debate to call it a flagrant.  The two tier system in the NBA is a biased joke.  Rules are rules except when they are applied with obvious bias.  Kendricks elbow to the head of Jefferson?  The league ought to review that and suspend him a game.  You hit someone in the temple with the end of that elbow and they are out big time.  Dangerous.
stairwell13::Durant is second in the league in technical fouls, one behind the mentally unstable DeMarcus Cousins.  Guess the myth of Durant being a classy guy has been put to rest.
ThunderHornz::Are you short? Obese? Genitalia challenged? I can't imagine what kind of hole in my life/soul it would take for me to act like you.
RicanBuc49::Are you?
4 Petes Sake::False.  KD its just NOT NICE!!  Your mom shouldve aborted you.
711Teo::go to sleep, loser
VolkieG::Well done, Jazz.
stairwell13::hmmm
sutherlacd27::Thanks for nothing thunder.
ThunderHornz::Well done Jazz, very well done! It was a pleasure talking to you. Good luck and good health!

dcmorris008::Should the jazz trade Jefferson? I go back and forth because i think they cant score without him, but Kanter and Favors have to start getting more PT in my opinion.
RicanBuc49::No they should keep the best post player in the league.   Trade Millsap
didyougetthememookur::Milsap didn't sign the extension, so the Jazz might try to trade Milsap and keep Jefferson.
R Barron::Yes. They could make up for his scoring if they got a pass first PG to help Favors and Kanter get in the right positions to score. Plus Burks and Hayward are improving on offense. Also, on defense, the young bigs make up a lot of ground. Only problem is that there are not many options out there right now.
dcmorris008::Yeah I agree, it has to happen sooner or later.  I think its more about just getting Jefferson out of there, I would trade him for less just to get him moved.
-Td4mvp3 -::The spurs are without a doubt the best team in the NBA
MaxFriz93::In the regular season sure, but everyone knows the Heat turn up in the playoffs
mccoy3181::The East is weak
dcmorris008::Agreed.
-Td4mvp3 -::The Waco Kidd....see man doesnt it feel good to be nice and reasonable for a change....seriously man its not healthy bieng such a dick all the time
dcmorris008::Fair enough, I like how he includes himself with the spurs as being winners.
RicanBuc49::The Waco Kidd - I've always found use of the pronouns "we" or "us" when talking about your favorite sports team to be misplaced.  Nah without US the fans they are nothing.
The Waco Kidd::I've always found use of the pronouns "we" or "us" when talking about your favorite sports team to be misplaced.
dcmorris008::He is just mad that you are cooler than him.
The Waco Kidd::Ehhh... Cooler is debatable. I'm on here too after all. Funnier is a given though. And probably taller.
dcmorris008::Did you confuse him with yourself?
The Waco Kidd::It's definitely possible.
The Waco Kidd::I'm always nice and reasonable and much funnier than you. The Spurs will be a good team regardless of how big of a loser you are.
-Td4mvp3 -::me and the spurs are winners bud!!!!!!!!
The Waco Kidd::So I'm thinking final WC standings, all other things being equal: 1. Spurs 2. OKC 3. Clips 4. Nuggets 5. Memphis 6. Utah 7. Golden State 8. Houston
bigzepfan::Doesn't matter where the Jazz end up in the standings. They are losing in the first round badly. Defense is like kryptonite to Al Jeff. No D in the middle, no second round. Score as much as you want, you will not outscore better teams four times.
Imortaliz::Golden State can't defend anymore, and until that comes back, they are in serious trouble.
R Barron::Golden State is tough. Especially with Bogut back, I don't know if they'll fall.
AceyUT::i would go for that..  the clips/jazz matchup would be entertaining to watch, espeically if both teams are healthy
bougere7897::switch memphis and denver.
dcmorris008::Wow, yeah the grizz can be dangerous but they are not playing nearly as well now, compared to how they started the season.
The Waco Kidd::Memphis has played 29 at home and 22 on the road. They are in for a rather significant drop in the 2nd half of the season.
The Waco Kidd::I was being generous leaving Memphis at 5.
dcmorris008::Wha?? You think the grizz will finish ahead of Denver?
The Waco Kidd::OKC most likely to advance. Spurs need to hope the Nuggets beat Memphis, which they probably would with home court advantage. Jazz could push the Clips to a 7 game series, Golden State will lose in 5. Houston will win a game or two against SAS.
howdytharrr::sounds right
R Barron::Doubt GS will fall to 7
-Td4mvp3 -::best episode of tales from the crypt ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49dV71bC07w
Titans_ are_ Oilers::Congrats on the win Utah fans, gonna go check out some other boards. Go Spurs! @Waco: The sheriff is coming and he's a............
Titans_ are_ Oilers::No carnswargitt I said the sheriff is coming and he's a
The Waco Kidd::What did he say? He said the sheriff is near!
The Waco Kidd::BONNGGGGGGGGG!!!!
-Td4mvp3 -::Emma Watson is so freaking hottt
-Td4mvp3 -::Thumbs up if a girl that has an outee is the most disguisting thing you've ever seen!
-Td4mvp3 -::Dr. Pepper you most definetly do not make the world taste better
The Waco Kidd::Wouldn't you like to be a pepper too? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t2wn-xE2ik
-Td4mvp3 -::C'mon you all know if the spurs faced the heat in the finals...you jazz fans would cheer for the spurs...admit it!
RicanBuc49::Yup. I hate LeBron.  My list Lakers  Heat  Patriots  Cowboys Atlanta  Yankees  Bama  UF  FSU
The Waco Kidd::I wouldn't cheer for either since I'd be indifferent. I'd just watch in awe of Lebron.
The Waco Kidd::No question. My second favorite team is whoever the Lakers are playing. And Duncan already has more rings than Kobe as the best player on his team.
BeaverPoke::I donno man. I want Timmy to catch Kobe in rings, but I also want the LeBron haters to shut up.  If it was the WCF LA vs. SAS, I will be cheering for the spurs in a heartbeat.
The Waco Kidd::You'll get nothing and like it.
-Td4mvp3 -::You'll be in awe of who I tell you to be in awe of!
ensign.devyn::Nope
The Waco Kidd::How was my reply?  -------------&gt;
dcmorris008::Ha! I bet he hates you right now! He is probably looking up those lyrics haha
The Waco Kidd::I figured he wrongly attributed an Olivia Newton John song to Paula Abdul, so when he fixed it, I'd reply with lyrics to a Paula Abdul song.
ensign.devyn::He's one of the worst writers ever, I swear.
howdytharrr::lol stupid song in my head now
-Td4mvp3 -::it lacked originality
-Td4mvp3 -::Well if u all hate the thunder than cheer for the spurs! come back to the jedi! ;)
ensign.devyn::No one hates the Thunder. Almost every Jazz fan is indifferent to them. And all you've done tonight is make Jazz fans dislike the Spurs, and like the Thunder over you. Mission failed
The Waco Kidd::http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ytCEuuW2_A
The Waco Kidd::I'd cheer for the Spurs if Parker and Ginobili weren't such floppers.
Ivanov21::@ waco : D Wade , CP3, Griffin - all of these guys are bigger floppers than the ones you mentionned. D Wade is by far the biggest one-man flopfest in the NBA
Titans_ are_ Oilers::Duncan no flop
The Waco Kidd::I don't think Duncan is. He just has no meniscus.
-Td4mvp3 -::heyyy CP3 and Blake Griffin flop...Ginobili and Parker draw fouls...see the difference? ;)
dcmorris008::Dont  forget duncan
Das Ravenator::Told ya  -- James Harden
ensign.devyn::It's not enough that your team won the SB, you still have to troll at 1:30 Central on a Thunder board with no Thunder fans on it?
-Td4mvp3 -::Thunder fans just mad cuz all their hopes and dreams of ever winning a title went out the window right along with harden...lol XD
ensign.devyn::You know not 1 Thunder fan is on right now, right?
R Barron::The good news about the spurs, is that when half their roster retires this season, they'll qualify for social security right away.
-Td4mvp3 -::still winning tho ;)
-Td4mvp3 -::Waco ur a thunder fan...traitor
Titans_ are_ Oilers::Candy gram for Mongo
The Waco Kidd::Has to do with where choo choo go.
Titans_ are_ Oilers::are you a Blazing Saddles fan?
The Waco Kidd::Mongo only pawn in game of life.
The Waco Kidd::I'm not a Thunder fan. See, this is an OKC-Utah board, so you'd think that only fans of those teams would be here, but lo and behold... here you are.
ensign.devyn::^Look everyone, td's learning.
The Waco Kidd::You'd think I would be, since that's the board we're on... but you never know, do you?
-Td4mvp3 -::so ur a jazz fan??
The Waco Kidd::Haha! I made him retweet!  +1 internet for me.
dcmorris008::Yeah that pretty much just made my night, i was literally laughing out loud
The Waco Kidd::Glad I could help.
ensign.devyn::Please call him out again
ensign.devyn::"I thought it was Paula Abdul, as you tweeted 5 minutes before this"
The Waco Kidd::What should I say?
R Barron::Good work
-Td4mvp3 -::what an idiot
The Waco Kidd::And yet still smarter than you.
-Td4mvp3 -::The spurs will sweep okc this year...book it!
The Waco Kidd::They got half way there last year.
Titans_ are_ Oilers::one can only hope
R Barron::Tony Parker is definitely top twenty in the running for MVP.
ensign.devyn::Right behind #19 Alec Burks
The Waco Kidd::Easily.
ensign.devyn::"When you step on the court with him," Jefferson said of his former Boston teammate, "you know it’s going to be a physical. There ain’t no soft in him nowhere."  Al really might slaughter the English language more than Karl.
The Waco Kidd::Triple negative.
The Waco Kidd::Ha
ensign.devyn::He just pumped faked twice in one sentence
dcmorris008::Waco Kidd calling out @tribjazz on twitter, nice!
R Barron::As an Olivia newton fan I took it personally.
The Waco Kidd::Takes 5 seconds to Google to make sure you aren't posting something incorrect and stupid.
dcmorris008::There it is...
dcmorris008::That was awesome, lets see how long before he corrects himself
-Td4mvp3 -::westbrick always gets owned by TP...next!
lakers2013champsz..::chokelahoma city
The Waco Kidd::Could be worse. They could have spent $100 million to be in 10th place.
LilDwayne21::Big confidence booster for the Jazz headed into the Playoffs.
The Waco Kidd::You mean headed into the All Star break.
-Td4mvp3 -::The spurs are the only team that can take out miami.....and we will
R Barron::Westbrook is gonna score 80 on Parker
2noodlekaboodle::Ya, if that's the case he should have dropped 110 on Tinsley and Watson.
howdytharrr::Parker &gt; Westbrick
-Td4mvp3 -::XD
ensign.devyn::"I think that’s the biggest game of the year for us," point guard Earl Watson said.  Earl and I think alike.
dcmorris008::Earl is the man! He is a true jazzman
The Waco Kidd::Jazzm'n
The Waco Kidd::Legitimate question: Is there a player in the league who falls down unnecessarily more than Tony Parker? I know he's French, so it makes sense, but I was just curious.
-Td4mvp3 -::Hes gonna be the MVP this year son ;)
dcmorris008::MVP of the spurs yes!
The Waco Kidd::Not even a remote chance he will fall his way to that.
-Td4mvp3 -::The spurs own the NBA!
R Barron::KD, Westbook, wade, Lebron. Who guards them?
dcmorris008::Yes they do, now go tell someone else.
Titans_ are_ Oilers::wouldn't go that far but they are really good
ensign.devyn::When did they last reach the finals?
ensign.devyn::Spurs = great regular season team that hasn't been able to get over the hump in the playoffs for a long time.
-Td4mvp3 -::This year I mean
R Barron::ensign.devyn - You know Harden choked in the Finals, right?  It's true. Honestly they could trade Martin for a low post scorer
-Td4mvp3 -::Kmart will show the NBA why he's been dealt around the league a few times in the playoffs when he fails to provide the clutch factor that harden gave
Titans_ are_ Oilers::but not against the spurs
ensign.devyn::You know Harden choked in the Finals, right?
dcmorris008::You guys?
ensign.devyn::I'm not a Thunder fan, bud.
-Td4mvp3 -::hes the main reason you guys even got to the finals
-Td4mvp3 -::No Harden= No Chance...sorry ;)
ensign.devyn::If that's the case, what does 1 year older after already getting beat out last year, and not being able to make the finals for years now, equal?
The Waco Kidd::It's too late for trolling.
-Td4mvp3 -::The spurs cannot and will not be beaten! ;)
ensign.devyn::Just like last year?
The Waco Kidd::LOL. Durant said good D from Perkins is why Big Al took 22 shots to get 23 points... Or is it that not everyone in the league gets to shoot 10 FTs a game, like he does?
Titans_ are_ Oilers::it's the not nice KD
ensign.devyn::And Al shot 50%. Not amazing D by any stretch. Just more sore loser vamping
ensign.devyn::Yep. Plenty of players play with an edge, but they don't make stupid comments that come off as being an immature sore loser. It's too bad
The Waco Kidd::He misinterpreted "edge" to mean cry baby titmouse.
ensign.devyn::Idk, if they keep the same core group and are contenders every year, I don't see why he'd leave. I agree with you about the ego though. When everyone was first like "Durant needs to have more of an edge to him" I agreed, but he's letting it spin out of control now.
The Waco Kidd::It's only a matter of time till he's a full fledged d-bag and when his ego gets big enough, he'll want out of OKC. He's no Tim Duncan/Karl Malone.
ensign.devyn::Yeah, again, just more of him being a poor loser. Really immature and it's too bad to see, from a guy that's supposed to be one of the more classy superstars
The Waco Kidd::And what was with the Delta Center isn't loud comment? First off, DC and the Rose Garden are hands down the two loudest. OKCs got loud in the playoffs... except for when they were playing Miami, of course. When OKC eventually sucks, if their arena is still loud, then they can talk.

R Barron::Thunder can't score down low. They need millsap or Jefferson :D
R Barron::Maybe Martin, not that the jazz have much interest. Otherwise a backup pg and someone else in a three team deal.
R Barron::Better than nothing.
ensign.devyn::I could see a backup pg such as maybe Maynor, and get Perry Jones to come off the bench at PF.
ensign.devyn::Who's worth picking up on their team, that they'll actually give up, for either one of those?
