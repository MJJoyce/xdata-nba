robvanhoutte::Whats the deal with Nicholson not playing?
TresMilagro::Wow! sorry I missed this one. NOT!
midway142::HELLO EVERYBODY WIZARDS WILL BEAT NETS IN NBA FINALS 4-0 SWEEP
TheCronoMasterMind::So Washington injures Davis on a dirty hit when the Magic beat them, and then take advantage of it in this game. Horrible officiating in the first half, doesn't take a genius to see that, but the second half wasn't quite as bad. Hope Moore isn't out for too long. We really need our guys back from injury, things are just getting embarrassing.
phunky58::44 doesnt play magic lose, get it together jacque. u look like a high school coach

bighog129::In response to earlier discussion on this being a weak draft...  First of all, the Warriors are not a playoff team. Dallas is barely. But both your examples are laughably bad. Hmm, ever think Crowder and Festus have gotten minutes because Dirk and Bogut have been out?...and not because they are some über talented stud? And NO, Rubio was different. He was drafted, smart guy. So was Bargnani. There's a big difference between drafting a guy from overseas, and signing a Free Agent from overseas.   And seriously, bro, make another cliche statement, why don't you?..."there's more to basketball than just stats"...gee, thanks, Phil Jackson. The people that make those kinda remarks in a forum like this are always the guys that know nothing about basketball. So they just stick to the various themes from Hoosiers and Space Jamz.
GeorgeTownDC29::You are seriously a ret-ard. Shved ENTERED the draft and went undrafted. He was coincidentally signed in free agency. If you were in the draft at all that means you were part of the draft class. Also, did you not say that if you played pro-ball over-seas than you should not be considered a rookie draftee? Rubio did before he was drafted idiot. Make up your mind. When did I say Festus and Crowder were studs? I just said they contribute to playoffs teams, which the Warriors will be. Cliche statements are fine as long as they are truthful. Better than some gradiose statement like, "Huh unless your name is BigHog you dont know anything about basketball and huh its typical to run into fools like this in bball forums and huh if you dont put up stats like lebron then you should'nt be in the NBA. I know because I own my rec league blah blah blah"
Maxi Klinger::Giving up 105 points to the worst team in the league, the worst offensive team in the league...  LOL, Orlando breaks the losing streak for the Hornets (who are now at home losing to the woeful raps) and now get crucnched by the woeful Wizards......  LOL, looks like the magic players just want to pad there stats
TheCronoMasterMind::You obviously are just a troll that doesn't follow anything at all. Magic are without Harrington, Turk, Davis, and Moore went out at the end of the 1st with an injury.
jsn_trx450::Woooo cheap papa johns tomorrow!!
KeepitCool247::Wizards win Wizards win it's a miracle!
gobison12::And the crickets go nuts!!!!
playrugby25::Finally, how about we make it 5 tomorrow in Chi town? Wishful thinking.
-Chiraze-::'Wishful' is the key word there
sportsfan1014::sweet win #4, thanks to Michael Jordan Crawford tonight!!
GeorgeTownDC29::Wall was shooting during warm-ups. Might be ahead of schedule. Would defiantly rather wait for him to be 100% though
chris johnson 558::if lakers lost kobe or howard they will suck if miami lost lebron or wade or bosh they will suck but the magic are playing without big baby . turk and al harrington and we still playing to the last minute in every game we must respect our team
bronbronsdad::dont forget Moore
OPENLYUGLY::Hopefully the new GM will quickly get a BONIFIDE PG soon. This is UGLY! SUCKS getting LIT UP by PG's on a nightly basis because they keep sticking to this short, slow, non playmaking PG who can't defend or run an offense.
GeorgeTownDC29::4-23! Recognize
PartTimeHomer::lol
bronbronsdad::we need to stop playing the wizards. Last game we lost Baby and now this game Moore
PartTimeHomer::Goon squad.
GeorgeTownDC29::we really are
tizi6969::Nice Win, looks the lineup should be   Temple Crawford Webster Seraphin Nene     But I don't mind have our scoring off the bench if we win....
DX_Hoo::I honestly don't think it matters who starts and who comes off the bench, as long as the lineup stays the same.
GeorgeTownDC29::Seraphin is better coming off the bench
chris johnson 558::the only player who has a heart for the magic is jj redick
d butler16::Maybe Temple should be the starting SG
BaltimOre1576::WE WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!
superbearsfan1::why doesn't jacque start jj and sit moe, and give andrew some PT, Come on man.
phunky58::haha in ur face jacque. keep sittn  44
ovechkinsgoal::the wizards are the best 3-23 team ever.  seriously.
PartTimeHomer::So many winnable games. It's painful.
IsaacTaylor4444::I wish redick could get traded to a good team but most of all I just wish the magic could find an actual point guard. If they keep losing they should think about trading their older players and letting the younger ones gain experience.
Leader Of The Grape Soda Exiles::The Wizards will be a 8 Seed...  ... when Avery Johnson coaches them next season.
GeorgeTownDC29::Depends on who we draft
ovechkinsgoal::garrett temple was a value add
GeorgeTownDC29::For this game at least
chris johnson 558::jameer for jimmer and demarcus cousins what about this
superbearsfan1::why would you screw the kings over like that?
OPENLYUGLY::Jameer for ANYBODY!
pyskatyskurwiel::Chill Out,Jacque still got it.
GeorgeTownDC29::GG Magic. You guys just have no inside presence without Big Baby
phunky58::they do he sits on the bench.  44
GeorgeTownDC29::He should have got more minutes then
chris johnson 558::afflalo is not a clutch player
PaisleyAccies::I'm oddly nervous for the Wizards to hang on...
MagicBoltzRays::Get rid of GAyon. Start Nicholson.
phunky58::makes me sick, the guy is gettn screwed
phunky58::exactly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wat the hell is jacque thinking
pyskatyskurwiel::he isn't thinking at all
phunky58::2 games in a row 44 sits and the magic cant beat awful teams.  he plays they win..   fire jacque or trade 44
phunky58::there is winning, they win with him in and he usually outplays every1 when he  ggets mins
OPENLYUGLY::There's more to playing than just scoring. We already have a one dimensional PG who is USELESS if he can't make shots.
phunky58::he's a scoring machine
phunky58::they win when he plays, they lost back to back to the hornets and wiz when he sits. i rest my case.
OPENLYUGLY::44 needs to STOP blowing assignments on DEFENSE!
IsaacTaylor4444::Nicholson sucks so shut up already
neverstoppers23::lol magic have given up, up 15 to the worst team in the league and they lay down. i would be sick if i was a magic fan. its one thing for your team to be bad. its anther for your team to just give up and not care at all.
OPENLYUGLY::The battle for MORE PING PONG BALLS!
GeorgeTownDC29::Nene and Crawford playing great
phunky58::u wana lose just let andrew rot on the bench, assshole coach
airic.ad::Nene, doing it all.
OPENLYUGLY::CLEAR PATH!
MagicBoltzRays::it will be reversed.
phunky58::why the hell is andrew sittn again?? wtf is wrong with jacque
DX_Hoo::Hahaha, first time this season with two 20+ scorers.
OPENLYUGLY::NeNe is the future of the Wizards
sportsfan1014::too old for "the future" don't you think?
ToshiYoshida2013::Hang on Wiz!!!
lookitsdeco::nene DROPPIN JUMPERS BOYYY
lookitsdeco::SCORE ONE MORE POINT ORLAND
JOHNCROW33::i know !!!
OPENLYUGLY::NOW REFS? NOW? A lil' too late NOW!!!
phunky58::no nicholson= no wins
phunky58::haha love it, leave drrew sit and get beat by 1 of the worst teams in the league.  great job jacque
phunky58::well i hope u guys win this 1
DX_Hoo::I'm pretty sure we're THE worst, don't sell us short.
