celticspatsbruins::.
Beanslams46::Sixers have won six road games this season without Bynum......impressive.
WinBig154::I've been following a bet system called SportsBettingStar a few months back. Since I started playing this system I have doubled my money in just two months. You can find this system on the first page of google if you search the words Sports Betting System.  I recommend this system to anyone that likes to bet on sports like I do
EagleFan19050::Spencer Hawes has immense talent but rarely does it show the desire to utilize that talent This is the first time i seen have 2 great games in a row. Hopefully, this is becoming a trend and Hawes will bring it ever night. To be among the best at your craft you have to bring it every night
batennisstud::@woyplate
ALLforthelulz::Am I the only one that week after week sees this Portland starting 5 and is shocked at just how badly they've done this season? I cant figure it out. LA's best year, Hickson's break out season ( 1 of only 10 in the league averaging a double-double), Damien is ROY, batum and wes are great starters. all that for 31-35 seems like a complete underachievement
H-Infinity::Worst bench of all time. It's usually (at most) 8 on 10, but usually the only two NBA players coming off the bench are Maynor and Claver. Leonard, our oft-injured rookie center has no idea what to do (he's played SG his whole life but just hit a growth spurt). He can score, though.  Claver is a Spanish rookie who looked awful in the Olympics but is coming along.  The rest: Barton (rookie) SG: plays occasionally but severely underweight and game is out-of-control street ball. Could be useful one day.  Freeland (rookie) C: terrible at NBA basketball. Great on English (British?) Nat'l Team. Almost never plays. DN-CD.  Eric Maynor P/SG: recent third-string cast-off from OKC. Began NBA as rising star in 2009 but tore ACL. Great for Blazers, especially for the "second unit" and Lillard, who can play off him. Not good on defense, either.  All others: almost never play, and it's now rare to see Freeland or Barton play. The only backups the Blazers have are an awful rookie C (who they're trying to develop—or see if it's possible), a rookie SF Spaniard who's progressing on defense and court iq (but can't shoot/score), and four year vet (expected star turned ACL victim) backup PG who's trying out to get a job (like JJ last year) but wants Portland to use $6M for a cap hold (he wants them to retain his QFO) rather than like JJ who was an UFA  signed by the Blazers after the.10-days.    So you're correct: the Blazers have a very good starting five (minus a center), but the starters need to play the whole game, essentially.  Man I hate typing on an iPad, but I've neither no non-tablet computer nor discretionary money to buy one! Please excuse typos, bad grammar, bizarre gaffes, etc.
ClydeTheGlide_22::Not much you can do when those amazing starters have to play 40+ minutes ever night because the bench is so horribly inept
kiwisamespnfan::Damian Lillard scores 20+ for the 33rd time this season
J.P. Olukemi::clear cut ROY
slickwatts100::Evan turner regressed this year, he's officially more suspect than prospect
initialX::the only thing that is up is his minutes.
J.P. Olukemi::His FG% is down from 44% to 41%  everything else is up, some things significantly up.  so check that stat before you rat. BOOM
slickwatts100::i don't wanna hear that crap, iggy is out of the way and this is the breakout year we get?
EagleFan19050::Nice going Collins, We need to see the youngsters Lavoy Allen and Arnett Moultrie playing not over 30 scrubs that are not our future like Royal Ivey and Damian Wilkins. You have to be the worse coach when it comes to evaluating talent. Because of you we sent Nic Vucevic packing because you didn't give him enough minutes to see he was a stud. Now your making the same mistakes again With Allen and Moultrie
bluehen97::AGREED!!!
J.P. Olukemi::How is Maynor working out for you guys? - Thunder fan
127decibels::Blazers just setting for next year. They already have Lillard - who will be one of the best players in the NBA. This kid's a beast.
kiwisamespnfan::not gonna let it go.... wesley matthews is a detriment to the trailblazers. look at his game logs and see how many sub-30% shooting performances the guy has had.
127decibels::He's shooting over 40% on the year from 3. http://espn.go.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers
kiwisamespnfan::so does JJ Reddick. Are you going to tell me your argument for Wesley Matthews being an asset rather than a liability is his 3PT%?  Kid takes too many shots when he is missing.  Watch a Blazer game every once in a while... kid is streaky
BaySports 1.1::Stupid loss.  Could have gained a game, again.  Oh well.
slickwatts100::can't even tank right
cmdcw4::haha losings overrated
58rhodes.3::Give up Blazers
mdr2855::Poor effort Blazers, y'all gonna lose tomorrow too
nomorten::How come there were so many white guys playing for the Blazers in the second half. What happened to Hickson?
theSwayzeExpress::Hey Bynum.  Why don't you go home and get ya fu.ckin shinebox
Phillyteamsforever::Aldridge's jumperis brocker than Sam Bowie's ankles
cbiz82::you mean knees?
jnas1991::sixers are tanking their tank
MattN1013::Dream on
BroncoBoyz242::I can't wait until the offseason so we can actually make moves to strengthen the team. The bench has been awful this year but signing key players, especially a Center, would make us a legitimate playoff team. I like Maynor on the team, takes a lot of pressure off Lillard on both sides of the court. With the cap space, the 12th pick (pending we don't make the playoffs) can really allow us to do something.
sk0dawgs::whateverrrrrrr
Kobelies247::Even with all the Bynum Drama!  They still beat Portland.
sworthin117::our owner will buy their owner
ohiogu05::Last play goes to Aldridge to shoot a broke jumper again!
Kobelies247::And you wonder why i cant stand this team anymore...
127decibels::Cuz you're a fair weather fan? And that's generous.
sk0dawgs::nobody wonders about you
Kobelies247::Not my fault Portland is garbage..
Vegas_Forever::Are the Sixers going to try to resign Bynum?  Should they?
Dark Darwin::apparently he's a sushi man
ckysteve5::Only if they get to pay him in cheeseburgers
pico2013::Heck NO! Hawes is fulfilling his potential
zracer47::good job 3 out of the last 4 with a close game against the heat, and those teams are way better than the ones coming up that are in the bottom half in the standings.  I still believe.
ClydeTheGlide_22::There is a dangerous possibility of Blazers going 0-5 on this road trip.... If that happens it might be time to tank.
Ill-Blaze::yea becaue we need mass inexperienced players right? thats a big reason why the bobcats will forever be a lottery team lol
odonnelc7::zers will be lucky to win more than 5 games with their remaining schedule, first round pick here we come!
tyler_shay::oh it's been time to tank, don't give up that 1st round pick it's way too solid of an upcoming draft
Ill-Blaze::personally though @ this point we don't need more rookies we need solid vetrans
Ill-Blaze::no to tanking unless developing our bench by giving leonard, freeland, claver, and barton  more minutes then yes but lets not go out and intentionally try to lose that $@%!$ rediculous
Ill-Blaze::ClydeTheGlide_22 - the reason it would be good to lose, is we lose our 1st round pick if we make the playoffs. we could either draft a good player or trade that 1st round pick for some decent veteran players  this draft isn't great though the second round looks a little promising with an abundance of project bigs we could draft and send to the d leagues to develop though
ClydeTheGlide_22::the reason it would be good to lose, is we lose our 1st round pick if we make the playoffs. we could either draft a good player or trade that 1st round pick for some decent veteran players
ClydeTheGlide_22::I think they should start giving all the rookies bigger minutes at this point, no reason to make the starters exhaust themselves every night, it is only a matter of time before we get eliminated from playoff contention
Maxi Klinger::Games like this are only hurting the 6ers of getting a better draft pick
Dadsterbug::Note to Blaze:   Spurs!!   3 trophies!
Ill-Blaze::tanking is = lame no player respects that how do you expect to pick up legit free agents or retain players with that mentality?
SixerEaglePhillieFlyerFan608::Better draft pick does not always result to good players, we got Holiday at 17th and Thad at 12th, and got $@%!$@ Turner at 2nd
SixerEaglePhillieFlyerFan608::Jeff Green has 26 points for Boston in a half today Vs Heat, as much as I hate Celtics, hope they snap Heats streak
ricePaddy69::How come Hickson only played 16 minutes?
JacobRieyTimmons::nobody knows i guess??? needed him tonight
SwKWhiteKnight22::This is what I'm wondering, I need him for fantasy...did he get hurt????
nrcampb::Nice call stotts... Why would you call a play driving for a foul... That would be real stupid. Let's just put it up and pray.
ClydeTheGlide_22::Why does LA have to be the game winner? why not Damian or Wes? Games like this make me wish we still had Roy...
James186558::Haha Great game by the sixers
ShadowH2::It should have been to Damian, he was open too when Batum passed it to Aldridge.
letitgrow73::Every game makes me wish we still had Roy.
SixerEaglePhillieFlyerFan608::Holiday&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Lillard
jm128097::how is he dirty
jm128097::lillard is not dirty at all
ckysteve5::As a Sixers fan, Lillard is dirty. Glad he is not in the East
xkizarux::Holiday has better defense, but they are close.
ClydeTheGlide_22::Their stats are very close, you can't be saying this just because philly won by one point
ShadowH2::They are pretty much exactly even if you look at the box score.
letitgrow73::Oh, those  Blazers..
portland1975::as good as Aldridge is he has not and will never be clutch!!!!!!
portland1975::never in big games never, not that this is a big game but back to the basket offense late game NBA is no good, lillard is already more clutch then Aldridge!
sworthin117::tell that to Dallas
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Lillard drive the basket get the call. Oh wait what?
CoreyGallagherArt::Devastating win ugh
Ill-Blaze::should of put the ball in lillards hands
Ill-Blaze::should of put the ball in lillards hands
OregonDucksWinTheDay:::(
MoneyWeems2477::Like if Jrue Holiday is a top 5 point guard
big145fly::I liked damians game more than I did jrue. No knock on Jrue, he's an all star, but wasn't even the top pg in htis game.
ckysteve5::Top 10 and a deserving All Star but not top 5
xkizarux::Top 7. Needs to work on turnovers, then he will be top 5, also needs better teammates.
Ill-Blaze::no top 10
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::Top 30 maybe.
DABU---RAPTORS---TDOT::No way brah.
MoneyWeems2477::just wanted to know if anyone thought so
eliminat0r85::alls young had to do was inbound it and it was a winner. but nooo throws it away. Pushing the spread. Legit
Pair Of Wool Socks::Shut up Portland fans. Your team is trash
NW-Prophet82::Nobody is saying anything you weirdo
LA Clipp Joint::should have given that s.hit to illard
SwKWhiteKnight22::What happened to JJ Hickson? Only 16 min??
pacers121::ShadowH2 Aldridge doesn't doesn't have a clutch bone in his BODY. --- explains that three.
sworthin117::tell that to Dallas
Champ Kande::BLAZERS LOST
SixerEaglePhillieFlyerFan608::Blazer fans, Turner and Hawes for Matthews and Hickson
sworthin117::ha
