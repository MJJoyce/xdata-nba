nunya::People are talking bout Haywood's bad night of shooting...but he is the primary scorer and playmaker most of the time, and needs to score  Secondly...Kanter and Favors are just not smart enough to clear put from the paint, just long enought to let him drive and get a layup or dunk to get his shooting going  Lastly, if they had a good pg...or at least another decent passer in the lineup, Gordon could get easier shots..  The Jazz better sign him, cause OKC, Dallas and the Spurs really want him
poorpple::I wonder how could Anthony Davis only averaged about 1.8 blocks per game (averaged 28 minutes in 64 games) during his 2012 season?
Lee b::I have to admit these UK guys are really good.
Cyril::I hope the Jazz have a good team psychologist, or this could end up like Gordon Hayward's sophomore year at Butler all over again. When he hits a slump, he really hits it.
Rico M::Trey Burke is playiing his first game tonight and he's gonna have a quadruple double!! Did I spell that right?
Aj Putian::idiot coach burke hitting shots then take him out
James::Hayward couldn't hit the ocean from the beach tonight.
Not My Problem::Dang Gordo, at least the rest of your stat line looked good. Loving that #1 pick already! Go Jazz!
Matheus::1-17? Nice job
seth::Burke already playing better than Rubio.
