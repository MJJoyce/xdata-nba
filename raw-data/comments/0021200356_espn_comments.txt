FreeBandz__::ATL shiiiited on 'em again :)
DanHalen880::surprisingly, ATL was able to keep it together and pull out the win.  Last year we lose this game.   we are somehow a better team this year.
FreeBandz__::defense and solid play win games
FreeBandz__::surprisingly? you don't win 15 games out of 22 surprisingly
DanHalen880::i've been watching and cheering for the atlanta hawks since 1978. we have not closed games out in the last few years.  we got rid of our "star" player and we are suddenly closing out games and winning.  that's surprising to me.
Marek7476::What a bust Beal is. From 6-7 shooting to 8-22. He is basically the reason Wiz lost.
FreeBandz__::The Wizard didn't lost because of Beal, they lost because.....theyre the Wizards??? duhhhh
jsn_trx450::Meh, he's only 19. Let's wait till he gets a real PG and a few more guys for defenses to key on. At this point he's better than Nick Young IMO.
sportsfan1014::so close yet another lose, better luck next game..
I3UTTON::Washington Generals &gt; Washington Wizards
marquies27::Taking to account that we have a lean team this year..ATL is doing a lot better than I predicted...
kingdman2011::DONT GET TOO COCKY WIZARD FANS, MY CAVS ARE WORSE THEN YOU, CAVS WILL OUTSUCK YOU, CAVS WILL MAKE YOU THE SECOND WORST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE
4SportsFanESPN::We have a great bunch of outside shooters. Unfortunately, all our games are played indoors
bosoxrick::beal has to be the worst-shooting shooting guard out there.  he should drive every time cause he is not a spot-up shooter
PartTimeHomer::Meh. I'm not worried about Beal. He's playing way too many minutes due to injury anyway.
MidniteEclipse::http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278076  About halfway through the recap...it wasn't Jamal Crawford's triple-double. It was Jordan Crawford's.
michahs1::Hey who won that atl/okc matchup in okc earlier this year, i forget.
Matthew Borba::Yes, a team that was in week 1 of a new roster. Good example. Who's got the best record in the league, I forget.
marat 2.0::"Heat overcome Crawford, Wizards for win in OT"? What is wrong with ESPN?
yohanzi213::It sucks because the Wizards could win these games pretty easily with Wall.
ATLsports15::C'Mon Hawks, got OKC comin in tomorrow, defense has to step it up with The Thunders big scorers
ChiGuy1002::PartTimeHomer:   "AD came back in less than a year, though. Also has played most of his projected career. This is something that's clearly going to follow Rose for the rest of his tenure in the NBA.    Don't think he's done, but I think Bulls fans should get used to seeing him on the DL." ___________________ What exactly do you mean by played most of his projected career? That AP's remained healthy and played most of his games? Untrue. That his career is almost over? Not necessarily either.  Rose's GP before last year in his first 3 yrs in the League:  81 then 78 then 81.   Yeah, a real constant on the Injured List, eh?  Don't try to pretend you know Rose's career at all.
PartTimeHomer::I honestly follow most sports and call all long-term injury lists disabled lists, you're the only person who has ever put so much stock in the semantics of that, that they've decided the conversation wasn't worth having.  Sorry that we disagree and it's hard for you to deal with that. I think Rose will end up facing more problems because of the leg. I think that it's harder to expect a guy to go through 82 games every year making cuts and jumping on a repaired knee than it is to expect a guy to go 16-19 games.  I also think Jamal Crawford isn't the same type of player as Rose. One of the biggest reasons that I think the injury will follow him is precisely because of the type of player he is. You're pretending the dude's going to change his nature and how he's played the game all his life because of the injury. To that end, I think I'm giving him more credit than you are.
PartTimeHomer::I mean that most running backs don't last as long as Peterson has in the league? That's pretty basic knowledge. Especially at his level of production. Guy's a freak of nature physically.  Peterson also didn't re-injure himself the same way Rose did. It's going to follow him.
PartTimeHomer::ChiGuy1002 - There's no "DL" in the NBA.  I can't have a reasonable conversation with a guy who clearly doesn't know much about basketball...  Semantics, man. All the lists serve the same purpose and the honest question will always be, did you know what I was talking about? If you did, then stop trying to be a smarta.s.s.
ChiGuy1002::There's no "DL" in the NBA.  I can't have a reasonable conversation with a guy who clearly doesn't know much about basketball...  It's called the "Inactive List".
ChiGuy1002::I think Rose will still have a long, prosperous career. Maybe he'll drive less widly to the hoop. Don't think he'll lose his talent.
PartTimeHomer::ChiGuy1002 - Peterson tore his ACL, Rose did. Rose never had that injury before. I'm not sure what you're getting at.  You're not sure what I'm getting at because you keep thinking I'm saying things that I'm not.  I said that I don't think the dude's done, but I wouldn't be shocked to see him miss plenty of time on the DL. I get that you're man-crushing, but come on.
ChiGuy1002::DId you know Jamal Crawford also tore his ACL? Can you tell?
ChiGuy1002::Peterson tore his ACL, Rose did. Rose never had that injury before. I'm not sure what you're getting at.
714cubbie25::crawford can hoop, a contender should try to trade for this guy
Dirty_Falcon7::didnt we gave him to the Wizards for piece of $@%! henrich w/e
zdunn1785::hes inconsistent though and will throw up alot of bad selection , but dont get me wrong the dude i very  offensively talented
951Antonio::You would be inconsistent too if you played for the Wizards.
back off bro::GO BACK AND LOOK FOR MY COMMENT. I SAID HAWKS BY 5 IN OT. F*** YEAH!
Lemuel7043::grats. here's your cookie
ForeverGrapeOKC::Hawks are in big trouble tomorrow. Please believe it....
back off bro::i can't wait to see you guys rape the heat on christmas.
ForeverGrapeOKC::that will happen.....
ForeverGrapeOKC::Hawks fans bragging cuz they beat the 'Zards in OT???? SMH
prisoner of academia::you already said we had enough to get to the 2nd round
lakhani47::forever grapes, that is not unfortunate at all, the hawks will be ready, get ready chokelahoma city atl is coming
ForeverGrapeOKC::its VERY unfortunate for you  ya'll bout to get blown out at home
lakhani47::trevor, i feel sorry for you, for u r a ret@rd. the hawks have had impressive wins idk where youve been, please go watch basketball then come here
trevorcabo::Let me know the next time they win more then 1 series in the playoffs?
Lemuel7043::I remember we beat OKC on the road without Josh Smith.
prisoner of academia::or without Al w/ a josh smith-ibaka poster on the wall
ForeverGrapeOKC::We do too....which is very unfortunate for the Hawks
prisoner of academia::you saw last month grape
ForeverGrapeOKC::we got somethin for ya'll  dont think we forgot
lakhani47::yup we will see
trevorcabo::Cant beat any decent teams so they take pleasure when they can
MattRoss420::Funny cause we beat Memphis and OKC once already this year. Not to mention the Clippers as well
Lemuel7043::yes
lakhani47::oh no please dont troll here right now atleast the hawks will handle yall tomorrow just leave
ForeverGrapeOKC::We'll see :)
2792JoshT::64 fantasy points from crawford. thanks man!
trevorcabo::And another loss for his team. Fantasy sports is one step below dungeons and dragons
J-SMOOVE666::Hawks are #1
prisoner of academia::I feel bad for the wizards. I really thought the picked up enough talent to fight for an 8th seed, or an least have more wins than the bobcats
ChiGuy1002::I think Atlanta's got the talent to get ousted in the 2nd round again this year.
ATLsports15::They're much more of a team this year, filled with guys that just get it done! Look out for us in the Playoffs
prisoner of academia::chicago got a chance to go back to those meaningful years of getting knock out in the 1st round
JBEarle::At least DC can brag about baseball and Hockey and college basketball
PartTimeHomer::Soccer and Football are back on the rise. Wizards really are the only sore spot right now and they weren't terrible a few years back. $@%!$ Gilbert.
Lemuel7043::haters, looks like J-Smoove is still the MVP in this game. game winning block
lakhani47::of course, smoove is beast!
joyhussain::aww poor wizards you tried so hard
lakhani47::gg wiz fans yall played tough yall are so much better than yalls record keep it up, and lastly GO HAWKS!!!!!
PodSox::i won my bet ben sheets
trevorcabo::When will the NBA realize there are not enough decent players to fill the rosters of the current number of teams and dump 3-4 teams
just trolling around::good win hawks
Adrian.Mapes::All wins are good
just trolling around::a win is a WIN
trevorcabo::How is going to Ot with the wizards a good win?
Sir_Sleepy_Slept::well there is no such thing as a good loss and a bad win.
lakhani47::the wiz are one of those teams that fight with every team but in the end loses
Dirtybearcub::what if we traded for james harden.
PartTimeHomer::Wizards luck? He'd probably be out with a dislocated brain stem or something.
JBEarle::It's over
PartTimeHomer::I hate Kyle Corver's face. I like how he plays and the attitude he plays with, but I want to pop a paper bag over that thing.
ChiGuy1002::I guess you don't like Ashton Kutcher.
Ben Sheets could be the second half savior for the Braves::Who's Kyle Corver?
PartTimeHomer::Because you have no idea who I was talking about based on one letter, amirite?   I've been playing a  bunch of DIshonored, give me a break.
ChiGuy1002::In a few years, I see the Wiz competing with the Bulls on the top of the Eastern Conference.
Adrian.Mapes::Rose is done.
ChiGuy1002::I don't have to. He posts his workouts to youtube.
Adrian.Mapes::Really? You know how hard he trains?  Do you work out with him?
ChiGuy1002::Rose hasn't been out for a year. He got hurt in May.   Dude trains like a psycho. He'll be strong when he comes back.
Adrian.Mapes::Hahah rose is not AD
PartTimeHomer::ChiGuy1002 - Just like Adrian Peterson was after his ACL injury, amiright?  AD came back in less than a year, though. Also has played most of his projected career. This is something that's clearly going to follow Rose for the rest of his tenure in the NBA.  Don't think he's done, but I think Bulls fans should get used to seeing him on the DL.
ChiGuy1002::Just like Adrian Peterson was after his ACL injury, amiright?
DOCBATES6100::Yeah, that's what they thought when they drafted Kwame Brown
ChiGuy1002::Yeah, the 2001 draft is completely relevant now.
PartTimeHomer::I'm a Wizards' fan and given how awful the front office is, I just don't agree with that. We'll be lucky if Wall is still here in a few years.
Ben Sheets could be the second half savior for the Braves::Bulls? Lol.
ChiGuy1002::Rose + Mirotic and one other piece shall be formidable
DOCBATES6100::Fudd Duck.
I Have The Pawaaaa::Wizards need to keep rebuilding their team like the Redskins are able to with the injection of the right mix of players and coaches. It may take another year or two to see results.
Dirtybearcub::what the hell hahaha
The_Calluminati::everybody beats the wiz!
lakhani47::oh babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
AdamStock1983::What is going on?
DOCBATES6100::Oh no
Dirtybearcub::if earl barron made a three, i think i would have to break a window
DOCBATES6100::In the words of Bruce Willis from Die Hard 2...pull up!! Pull up!!!
Lemuel7043::Horford is struggling for some reason
J-SMOOVE666::i swear.  if the wizards hit a 3 here, im going in ibakas mouth
Dirtybearcub::as a wizard fan, this is pretty hilarious
lakhani47::yeah it is, for some reason whenevr the hawks play the wiz its close
DOCBATES6100::Don't you mean...Hilario?? :p
ATLANTA BRAVES TOMAHAWK CHOP::Lou Williams needs to quit shooting Joe Johnson numbers ...6-18 FG  we can't have tht.
lakhani47::yeah true
lakhani47::he is the reason we are winning
ATLANTA BRAVES TOMAHAWK CHOP::yea but 6-18 is the reason we went to OT.
Dirtybearcub::hahah this is the grossest game ever
