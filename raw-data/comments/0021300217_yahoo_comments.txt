Jaron Z::I think we will get the lottery. Plus another lotto pick for Rondo.
Jack Rowland::Have watched the Celtics for a long time and the stinking, protected ref's, kill them, even on their own floor, with the fouls they call. Memphis shoots 31 foul shots to 13 for the celtics and are outscored 25  to 10. This is a bunch of BS and the NBA does nothing but protect ref's that just do anything they can to control the results of the game.
Matty S.::Atlanta and Brookyn are both losing again. Celts could end up with Atlanta's pick because they have the option of swapping picks with the Nets......but they both stink so it's looking good for the Celts getting 2 picks in the lottery!
HOOWA!::lol... our division is so bad, we're only a game out of first... win the lottery?, at this rate, we'll win the division!
AnthonyC::knighttemplar there is not another team in pro sports that has won as many championships in a row as the Celtics.or  have forgotten
bbb::Go Celtics!!!
Chance::All the Celtics need is a young Paul Pierce, a young Kevin Garnett, and a young Ray Allen. 85% of that is offense. They need a legit center and a SG who can create his own shot and consistently hit a jumper.   I guess that's a lot.
Commenter::us troops in korea say: GO CELTICS
fup duck::Even with Gasol out 6-8 weeks, Memphis will still go deep in the playoffs
Bob::Can Mike Miller even post up? Never seen him post up. After all these yrs he still doesn't play that good of basketball. All he knows is outside. Not much of a all around ball player. I guess I expected more out of him. Pretty much a one dimentinal player.
