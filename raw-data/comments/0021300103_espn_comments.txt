Denzel Boksingero::Imagine if Jeremy Lin as the starting PG only has 1 point and the back-up PG has 31 points. He'll be crucified.
Gejsi Marku::Take my 'like' please!
Andrew Canto::The amount of hate that Lin gets is unreal.  The dude is a solid player, and the team is better and more dynamic when he's on the court.
Robert Hawley::agreed 110%. people tend to hate players who get a lot of hype, and that's exactly what lin got during the linsanity days. now he gets a lot of hate instead, and it's even more undeserved.
Steven Anacker::I've read very little hate on here for Lin tonight. Though I can't argue that he does have a lot of over the top haters out there.
Jonny Felix::If he doesn't get the hype for being average than more people would hate less.
Denzel Boksingero::Lin stop passing. You'll just have more TOs because your teammates are no longer paying attention to your assists. Just score.
Karl Heu::I agree....You've earned the right to shoot at will
Michael Huang::If McHale doesn't start Lin after this game, he'll be benched before Lin does
Gejsi Marku::I don't get the idea behind the decision to start Beverley over Lin. It's just too unorthodox kind of decision, but either way Lin is faring with the situation very professionally and doing great job.
Wally Rouzer::blame mcfail he sucks as a coach rockets he has a loaded roster and he still chooses three point chucker beverly over lin
Jonathan E. Collins::Look at the stats and turnover comparison
Bryan Jones::its about defense. Lin cannot guard any of the decent point guards in the league
Smokee Doubleoseven::Ok, never been a fan of Jeremy Lin.  But this is becoming an every game thing were he plays about 50 times better then Beverly.  Wake up coaches.
Denzel Boksingero::Lin needs to stop focusing on assists. He's no longer recognized as the PG of this team and he'll just hurt himself with the piling TOs.
Yinan Chen::but Harden sucks at playing PG, everyone except Harden knows that.
Denzel Boksingero::Yinan Chen, that's true. if mchale just lets the Rockets know that Lin is the team's PG, Lin won't have these high TOs. the problem is, mchale does not want to be playing PG. i'm saying that Lin should somehow be selfish and attack the basket more and more.
Soal Saenbandith::If Lin is benched for his defense, shouldn't Harden also?
Jonny Felix::Harden is more consistence.
Michael Huang::Jonny Felix - you mean Harden is more consistent with his bad defense?
Soal Saenbandith::How?
Michael Huang::Lin is clutch
Michael Huang::Good job Dwight, now you have missed 25 free throws in just the last 3 games.
Devin Handley::It's Dwight. They KNEW when they offered him the contract that would happen. They also knew they were picking up an amazing defensive presence and a great rebounder
David Kang::Johnny Felix, here's a list of your "TOP PGs in the West Coast."     Stats are much closer than you think they are right?    Numbers never lie, bud.  Are you going to tell me that Lin will NEVER EVER make the all-star?  really?    Curry – PPG: 19.2  APG: 8.5 TO: 4.2  FG: .477  3s: .449  CP3 – PPG: 21.3  APG: 12.6  TO: 3.4  FG: .456  3s: .292  Parker:  PPG: 19.0  APG:  6.6 TO: 2.4  FG: .528  3s: .375  Lillard:  PPG:  20.5  APG:  5.7  TO: 2.0  FG: .383  3s:  .426   Westbrook:  PPG: 19.0  APG: 3.8  TO: 4.5  FG: .338  3s:  .308  Lin:   PPG:  16.125  APG:  4.6  TO:  3.3  FG:  .533  3s:  .438
Michael Huang::Wow, highest FG% and the 2nd highest 3-point shooting %.  Pretty impressive.
Cory Nope::Too bad that Lin can guard none of the others listed, huh?
Jonny Felix::Not now . There is now way Lin overtake Curry, Cp3,Parker, Liliard or Westbrook.  Here's is even a better list.  1.Ty Lawson	DEN	5 	37.8 	7.4 	17.0 	43.5 	 	2.0 	5.0 	40.0 	 	5.8 	7.2 	80.6 	 	0.6 	3.6 	4.2 	 	6.8 	2.6 	1.4 	0.0 	1.6 	22.6 	   2.Chris Paul	LAC	7 	36.1 	6.7 	14.7 	45.6 	 	1.0 	3.4 	29.2 	 	6.9 	7.0 	98.0 	 	1.0 	3.3 	4.3 	 	12.6 	3.4 	2.7 	0.0 	4.3 	21.3 	   3.Damian Lillard	POR	6 	38.1 	6.0 	15.7 	38.3 	 	3.3 	7.8 	42.6 	 	5.2 	6.3 	81.6 	 	0.7 	4.8 	5.5 	 	5.7 	1.8 	0.8 	0.2 	2.0 	20.5 	   4.Mike Conley	MEM	6 	32.1 	7.5 	14.3 	52.3 	 	0.7 	3.3 	20.0 	 	4.5 	4.7 	96.4 	 	0.3 	2.5 	2.8 	 	5.7 	2.5 	1.8 	0.2 	3.3 	20.2 	   5.Tony Parker	SA	7 	32.0 	8.0 	15.1 	52.8 	 	0.4 	1.1 	37.5 	 	2.6 	4.0 	64.3 	 	0.1 	2.9 	3.0 	 	6.6 	2.4 	0.7 	0.1 	1.3 	19.0 	  6.

I can see Lin moving up two spots which is 6 but no way he move to top three.
Denzel Boksingero::It doesn't matter if Lin is the starter or the bench player. What the Rockets need to do, like in this game, is to convince Harden, Howard, Parsons to play with and not against Jeremy Lin.
Yinan Chen::Parsons is pretty good at playing with Lin. Harden doesn't really mesh with Lin. Its too early to tell with Howard.
Michael Huang::When it comes to crunch time, McHale should ask Harden to defer to Lin.
Fan Cheng::Totally Agee he's 0-12 on game winning attempts Including an air ball tonight
Brady Simon::Fan Cheng 0-12? That is certainly not true
Derrick Lee::Harden had been playing with injury the last few games. I give him credit for playing through injury but his numbers are proving he's not playing up to his standard and should rest to get healthy. Fans bash players for not producing when playing hurt and also bash players when they choose not to play to get heathy. There's always haters
Denzel Boksingero::The sad thing about this is Jeremy Lin is just a back-up of Patrick Beverley. When the starters are all doing fine, he'll get less playing time. It's really crazy, but Jeremy Lin comes from the bench to rescue the starters. I guess the starters need to do a much better job of not playing catch-up.
Jerome McGhaney::At the time the reason they were playing catch up was there starting line-up having 2 big men, on the defensive side it's great but on the offensive side it's 3 against 5 and their opponents were hack-a-shaqing them every time they get near the rim.
Zin Win::Farking Racist nba.com__ picking Harden as man of the game over Lin... I think the Asian Sensation won this game hand down...
Jonny Felix::It isn't racist you idiot.Harden has a double-double just better than Lin in every category. Lin  only score five more points than Harden that's it.
Michael Huang::Jonny Felix - Lin is not better than Harden, but Lin was better than Harden in this game.
Craig Keller::Mchale needs to quickly find a way to stop linsanity from happening again, but I have faith that he will find a way like he did last year.
Brady Simon::Jeremy started all of last year until he got hurt. Plus the rockets offense is read and react so really McHale doesn't have a big say in the offense(in game) so IDK what your point is. How exactly did McHale stop linsanity? Did he tell Lin to stop driving to the basket? No he didn't.
Denzel Boksingero::Harden plays much better with Lin playing with him. The other team can't afford to double team him knowing that Lin can score.
Michael Huang::Lin's brilliance made up for Harden's low % shooting and Dwight's 8 missed free throws.
Shawn Bento::So I guess we'll ignore his 5 TOs...
Michael Huang::Shawn Bento - Lin won the game for the Rockets with his scoring, he did not lose the game for the Rockets due to his TOs
Robert Hawley::Shawn Bento i think 31 points makes up for that. didnt harden have even more turnovers than that?
Michael Huang::Harden & Howard, move over, there's a new sheriff in town.
Brandon Tigues::rudy gay 11-37 for 29 points..more like rudy bryant
Jonny Felix::Rudy Carmelo.
Brandon Tigues::Jonny Felix  lmao..rudy anthony
Michael Huang::Can't picture Kobe doing that, but can definitely see Harden doing that several times during the season.
Donald Ox::Linsanity is back tonight!
Michael Huang::Linsanity never left, it''s just suppressed under McHale's reign.
Michael Huang::I am tired of some folks who continue to insist that Lin should come off the bench and that Lin and Harden cannot and should not play at the same time.  Lin ahd Harden are the two best guards on the team and both should start and get the bulk of playing time at the guards positions.  Naysayers say that this will weaken the Rockets' bench.  Not so because Lin and Harden do not need to take breaks at the same time.  Substitutions can be made whereby either Lin or Harden are on the court at all time.  In last night's game vs. the Raptors, Lin and Harden played all but 15 seconds for the entire 1st and 2nd OT, which resulted in a Rockets victory.  If I were Leslie Alexander, I would tell McHale to start both Lin and Harden.  And if McHale doesn't know how to play both stars at the same time, he doesn't deserve to be the coach.
Denzel Boksingero::Jonny Felix: ·Last year he (Lin) handled most of the ball and still had similar numbers. Even when he was a starter he still didn't have great numbers"  LOL. Where have you been Jonny? Lin handled most of the ball last season? LOL.
Bredy Charles::Harden needs a coach than can teach him discipline on the court. It will be a long season for this young team.
Michael Huang::Maybe Harden should come off the bench like he did at OKC
Steve Broome::Michael Huang Harden was undisciplined off the bench and they're not going to pay a bench player that kind of money. You guys keep confusing reality with your fantasy teams.
Derrick Lee::U guys know he's playing through injury right?
Bredy Charles::This coach must be an idiot because Howard needs to sit or they will hack him until he makes free throws.
Mohamed Rafi Sirajuddeen::well, Rockets management knew the risk when they gave D12 the BIG contract. But yes, I know the frustration of the fans, when the guy who makes the most money has to run away from the ball at the end game!!
