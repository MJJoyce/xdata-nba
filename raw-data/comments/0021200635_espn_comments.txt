Clarence2126::another embarrassing loss to an 11 win 32 loss team by the weak a*s*s does.
1mproperDancing::Made more embarrassing because you guys essentially lost to the following line-up:  Daniel Gibson Shaun Livingston Wayne Ellington Luke Walton Marreese Speights
mikeyp2307::Go Cavs
parafal::Ilyasova obviously loves the coaching change... how did he not get more run as a FA?
Jason66324::its funny the cavs can still make the playoffs with the way boston has been playing and cleveland is now only 8.5 games back with 38 games left.... just got to keep on winning!
C-Town Fan 440::I doubt whomever wrote this article actually watched the game, it wasn't Kyrie who rallied the Cavs... It was the entire second team  Great reporting once again ESPN
karelp::"Brandon, meet All-Star guard Kyrie."  -- All the people who've said Jennings doesn't deserve to be an AS.
RobChudzinski_BrownsHC::LeBron'll be back after next season. And don't even say you don't want him to either.
C-Town Fan 440::I don't want him
BootyLoaf::you'll probably be gone after next season so...
sean8567::ok
JustB86::I don't know if I've ever been more confident with the ball in the hands of a 20-year old than I am when Kyrie has it. Normally if a second-year player has the ball in clutch time, you're nervous that they'll make some boneheaded mistake, force up a contested shot, buckle under pressure etc...but anytime Kyrie has the ball it almost doesn't even cross my mind that he might do the wrong thing with it. Kid's game is smooth beyond his years. Cleveland fan or not, we really are seeing the start of something special with Irving.
coltranesteelkirt::Cleveland is the hottest team in the league right now, but what is their major problem? Defense.   If they'd be more lock-down.... They could be sitting pretty with 10-15 more wins than they have.  Byron Scott needs to address this
JustB86::Yeah it really depends on what position we pick at. I think if we can get a legit scoring swingman we'll be good to make a run. We have Irving who can score but he's just too small to take the whole offensive load over by himself. I always thought we needed to take a center but I wanna see what Speights can do if we give him more minutes/a bigger role in the offense than he's had before.
JustB86::This is what I keep tellin people out here in Cleveland. We're not SUPPOSED to be a good team right now. And honestly it's not in our best interest to win game after game either. Not saying we should tank, but people shouldn't be too distraught with our record right now, because its just about where a team of all 90s babies should be. Just let the players develop and learn from the 2-3 vets that we do have, and build up a few more years worth of lottery teams. We'll be fine (or at least as fine as a Cleveland team can be lol)
RobChudzinski_BrownsHC::Lets just go with ONE more year of the lottery. I'd really like to see the Cavs make the playoffs NEXT YEAR.
RobChudzinski_BrownsHC::4/5 starters are 1st or 2nd year players. They need more time to develop.
YogaBeer::Rondo another triple double... in double over time.    Look at this game's box.   If you give Luke Walton the same minutes, he also has a triple double.  Luke Walton for President.  Go Cavaliers!
OverweightNotObese::But if you want to talk about which of these two teams is better, I think the record pretty much speaks for itself.   One game doesn't mean spit.  We have ten more wins than the lowly cavs to go with 13 less losses.  Plus the cavs have lost TWICE as many games as they have won.. AT HOME.  In conclusion, go home Cavs fans.  No talented NBA player wants to play for Cleveland, just the same as Milwaukee.
RJBBoston::better today, but still not going anywhere.  cavs are guaranteed to be better in the years to come and they are going somewhere - they have a core nucleus of high draft young players.
EricTheYank::Shut up fatty.
apbgsu::Every star will be lining up to play alongside Kyrie, cant say the same about any Bucks player. Plus the young core of Zeller, Thompson, Waiters, and Speights is only going to get better. Add in 10 first round draft picks in the next 4-5 years, yes the Cavs have that many, Irving just might not be the only star on this team. Milwaukee is in limbo,whereas the Cavs are bad for the moment, but give it a year and theyll pass the Bucks easily in the standings.
JaRoNiZoU::I wouldn't be talking too much crap, though.  The Bucks have only ONE win vs. teams with winning records in the month of January.  Cleveland now has two.
OverweightNotObese::Lol at all of you getting all worked up over Bucks v Cavs.  The only two teams that even matter in the NBA are the Heat and the Thunder.  That's going to be the finals for the next 4 years in a row.  Get used to it.
RJBBoston::this is true this year.  but in the years to come the cavs will be hot - they have a young core and cap room.  its good to keep your eye on up coming teams, much like the thunder were a few years ago
coltranesteelkirt::Lol.... The Heat?!? The Thunder??! I honestly was unaware they even still had teams.     The David Stern Trophy goes thru Cleveland this year.
Ivanov21::lol what are you? a prophet?
mr porkchop::mr porkchop Offensively when Monta do well, Jennings do bad, usually resulting in a loss. Other than that, they are good together. January&nbsp;25&nbsp;2013, 1:18&nbsp;PM  Like  Reply  Quote  Flag  Edit  Share I'll leave you guys with this statement I said hours before the game. Reason why the Bucks lost.
BootyLoaf::damn you still here?
BadgersPackersBrewersBucksWarhawks::livid
Its All About The Crew::I think skiles was coaching this game score 108 and lose come on deer play some defense
TheBrownestBob::Kyrie, Dion, Tristan.. and now Speights and Ellington; some legit bench players.. I like watching this team even more so than any of LeBron's teams.  If LeBron's teammates put up 15 pts in one game, people would say they had great games.  Now we actually have something that resembles a real team in the NBA rather than LeBron plus whoever.  Granted, an awful defensive team, but I think this team needs to learn how to run the fastbreak before they start focusing in on defense.  Right now, they never push after missed shots; everyone just looks for Kyrie.  As soon as this team can start running with whoever is available on a break, they will be well on their way to greatness.  As it stands, though, they keep getting caught in half court sets and Kyrie has to bail them out more than 50% of the time.
Ill-Blaze::lebrons teams though usually play good defense you guys just pretty much have to outscore opponents in order to win just saying and 90% of them wins comes when your best player at a position that should require alot more distribution does very little of it just saying
mikeyp2307::USE PERIODS ILL.
YogaBeer::4 other Cavs with double digits in scoring.    Just saying.  I'll take this team any day.
coltranesteelkirt::Kyrie is already a more skilled and complete player than LeBron and the scary thing is, it ain't even close any more.
TRHMC1::Skilled, yes. Complete offensively? Yes. Complete overall? NO. NO. NO.
Ivanov21::LOL how can you idiots (sorry but you are) even THINK about comparing a 2nd year PG, who certainly will have a great future, to the best player of the game, who plays another position and has about 18000 more points, 4500 rebounds and 4500 assists?? ridiculous
YogaBeer::If you compare the two at the same time, you'd see the comparison, idiot.
ngonzoak::He didnt say talented he said more Skilled. Kyrie and CP3 are the most skilled PGs for example. Westbrook and Rose are the most athletic. Lebron has a nice blend of the 2 but has Karl Malones size to go with it. Lebron is gifted. Kyrie is skilled.
Ill-Blaze::your a dumb $@% I'm not a big lebron fan but look @ lebrons statline he contributes in every area he even averages more assists then kyrie and would be a better pure point then kyrie rofl
scanmanOSU::Please just stop. You are making us Cleveland sports fans look ridiculous. I love Kyrie but to say he is a more skilled and complete player than LeBron is laughable. LeBron is the best defensive player in the league and Kyrie isn't even an average defender right now.
RJBBoston::kyrie is 20 and he is a point guard.  cant compare the two.  kyrie is great though.
TheBrownestBob::Right.  LeBron is a walking triple double every single night he steps on the floor.  And not a 10-10-10, triple double, he's a 30-10-10-4-3 threat every night.. his impact on a game is unequaled.
Jordan_93_29::Lol, you're a dumb.as.s
C-Town Fan 440::Actually he is 100% correct, LeBron is more talented, but Kyrie is more skilled.  If LeBron was The same size as Kyrie, he would be an average player
Pweezyondatrack::Was it these same Bucks fans saying that Jennings is better than Irving? Ha. Yeah right. Irving owned the Bucks tonight.
quickbr0wnf0x::Nice to see the Cavs overcoming a big lead instead of losing one. Once they learn to play with more consistency, they will have a lot of potential.
BootyLoaf::i want ot hear speights and ellingotn compare us to the memphis fans lol. when they were in first place they couldnt sell out a game. you could hear a pin drop in that arena too
MWaugTigerFan::Unlike the cavs, the grizzlies haven't had 42 years to build a solid fan base. The problem right now isn't selling tickets, its season ticket holders not going to the games. They need to go to more games and/or, give or sell their tickets to fans that want to go to the games that they can't go to. Its hard to get one of the better seats because season ticket holders hog them all.
Grindhouse2413::huh? wrong!
BootyLoaf::lol naw. i remember 2 years ago whent he cavs were playing memphis they were fighting for a playoff spot toward the end of the season and the arena was EMPTY. earlier this season when we played memphis they were in first and only had 13k there. PATHETIC
BadgersBucksPackers::Good win Cavs fans.
BootyLoaf::no respec for you -_-
BadgersBucksPackers::Thanks man.
JakeG1134::cavs are gonna go 30-8 to finish the season and make the playoffs, callin it
RJBBoston::if they had andy I would call it too!
King Hova II::They can go 20-18. . Especially with the additions added.. will they, thats a convo for a different day..
BootyLoaf::the cavs could go 20-18 the rest the way and make the playoffs in the east
coltranesteelkirt::really?
JohnsonnnL::Too bad the media doesn't care about the Cavs, this was one of the best games of the night.
du125::They will when Kyrie wins All-Star MVP.  He'll hit a bunch of 3's like he did in the rookie-sophomore game last year, he'll have some sick drives to the hoop, and he'll have a coast-to-coast buzzer-beating layup to give the East the win.
BootyLoaf::mr porkchop - Ha! That won't happen. The bucks are a win now team.  a win now team hovering around .500? and you were making fun of the cavs....
mr porkchop::Oh, I was making fun of the cavaliers??? Don't lie on me, boy. Our team is always trying to win now, thats why we are always around 8-9 seed. I like to see when I was making fun of the cavs?
mr porkchop::mr porkchop He should get more minutes than rondo. 1 Hour Ago  Like  Quote  Flag  Edit  Share
mr porkchop::Nope that was the other buck fans. I said some positive things just recently about Irving. Read below.
BootyLoaf::i was on these boards yesterday during the all star announcements. im 99% sure you took many shots at the cavs. as did you earlier before the game, maybe im wrong but im pretty sure you were
lester4586::mr porkchop is an idiot
mr porkchop::You only come out when someone calls me out? Coward.
mr porkchop::Lester4586 is that all you got?
mr porkchop::Lol
BootyLoaf::AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR DAT
mr porkchop::Thank you mr spellchecker. Will change that. Oh, you forgot the period at the end of your sentence.
BootyLoaf::the word i think you're looking for is 'compreHEnd' good sir
mr porkchop::Oh that was to lester4586 about Monta and Jennings. He mistakenly thought I said Jennings &gt; Ellis when I only said when Ellis play better than Jennings, the Bucks lose.
BootyLoaf::comprend a sentence? nice
mr porkchop::Oh, your back. Did you learn to comprehend a sentence?
Grindhouse2413::GO CAVS! Glad to see Mo and Wayne contribute. Irving is amazing. Great comeback!
nsmithNYC::Kyrie Irving happened.
pottttts::Great comeback. Down 20, Cavs played shutdown D and hit big shots. Like the new acquisition of Speights and Ellington. Cavs started three players that I believe are each only 20 years old, KI, Dion, and TT. 5 and 6 in last 11, and 3 out of last 4.Learning how to close out games. GO CAVS!!
Schwalmm::40 points 5 assists 35 points 2 assists  People hated on Westbrook SO much for not passing, Kyrie is worse
YogaBeer::Must be a Ricky Burio fan.   You know the type.      The only pg that's any good is a PG that can't score.
scanmanOSU::That may be the most ignorant statement I've ever read.
ng164300::Kyrie doesn't have Kevin Durant to pass to.
BootyLoaf::of course. id much rather have a player who can pass to players who make shots then a player who makes shots himselve.
Schwalmm::But his team, not counting him shot 50% tonight and he had 2 assists.  Everyone's excuses is because "his teammates suck"... aren't good PG's supposed to make their teammates better?
MetsxNLxChampsx2013::luke skywalton wn me 150 doll hairs tonight... im drunk, thanks bro
YogaBeer::Do you think the Bucks would like to trade Ilyasova for Luke Walton in a salary dump?
quickbr0wnf0x::Sure, why not!
mr porkchop::Ha! That won't happen. The bucks are a win now team.
ctowngambler78::hahaha.......
Manute Bogues::Hahahahaha at the people I saw demanding that Brandon Jennings replace Irving at the ASG.
YogaBeer::I think the debate will be, why isn't Kyrie playing more minutes in the AS game?    Can't we all just agree he's the best PG in the East (at least with Rose on the injury list).
mr porkchop::He should get more minutes than rondo.
mr porkchop::I don't think the debate was over Irving. It was about Holliday vs Jennings. Just saying.
JohnsonnnL::I hope they show the highlights of this game on sports center.
WIstormchaser2119::HOW THE F.UCK DO WE LOSE TO THE CAVS?!?!?
NDCHEG2012::Uncle drew knows that the game has always been, and always will be, about buckets.
Steveo1554::Kyrie....
mr porkchop::Ellis had a better game than Jennings. When he does, the bucks lose.
MemphisSwag::Your the Bucks enuff said..
mr porkchop::What that suppose to mean? The Bucks rank 9th in all time win percentage. You can't say that about the Grizzlies, loser.
mr porkchop::Your the Troll enuff said..
YogaBeer::No Uncle Drew.   No W.
YogaBeer::Looking at the Washington roster, if they can stay healthy the rest of the season, they're going to beat a lot of teams.
MemphisSwag::Cavs NO excuse for you guys next year...
MemphisSwag::Lots of good players to build with....This summer will be hugh for you guy...Best of luck to the Cavs I'm out...
YogaBeer::As a long time Cadaver fan, I can honestly say we're a few players away from getting to the PO.    But thanks.   go Grizz
BuckeyeRealist 13::What's up with CJ Miles? Sorry I'm out in Kansas, hard to keep up with the Cavs.
elcherino::pretty sure Scott's going with the hot hand, which I don't mind at all, you produce you play, you don't produce you sit, unless your Kyrie lol!
YogaBeer::I think we're all a bit giddy to see some bodies flying in the paint and it's "our" guy doing the banging.  With Double T and Spricket on the floor at the same time, they're basically gang banging tonight.
JohnsonnnL::I think they waived him in the Memphis trade.
MemphisSwag::LOL
YogaBeer::Well Dorothy, sometimes he plays.    Sometimes he doesn't.
YogaBeer::I'm thinking that after the Byron Scott experiment of starting him for a week over dion Waiters and this trade with the Grizz sort of displaced a few minutes.   However, I can Cj Miles getting more minutes in a different match up.
BuckeyeRealist 13::lol So no reason he didn't even log a second tonight?
karelp::Given the season stats and this game, there should not be any doubt Irving was the right choice over Jennings for the AS team.
MemphisSwag::Holliday&gt;Jennings
mr porkchop::I'm not debating that. It was about stats vs winning record. They chose stats. I'm fine with it. It's just in the past, winning record prevailed. That's why people felt Jennings got snubbed.
mr porkchop::I don't think the debate was over Irving. It was about Holliday vs Jennings. Just saying.
elcherino::Jennings and Irving, a difference of bricks and buckets
MemphisSwag::Because he gets BUCKETS!!!
MemphisSwag::Lebrohn left his hairline in cleveland...
MemphisSwag::Yeah  really bad....wit that scarf..I mean headband he has..
ctowngambler78::He got hair plugs put in, welcome to the future......
ctowngambler78::hes actually getting his hair line back lol....
HunterF4444::lol no hes not it's pretty bad.
BuckeyeRealist 13::Where was Josh Selby?
pottttts::Canton Charge
ctowngambler78::hes in the D league.....
suneeth9::he didnt play.
BuckeyeRealist 13::I understand that but ESPN doesn't have him listed at all, not even under "DNP"

lester4586::mr porkchop you are dumb
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::jennings plays an all around better game. Monta is the better pure scorer.  If I could only have one, I would take Jennings.
suneeth9::Ellis all day.
mr porkchop::Some people should never leave school.
Mackers012::?????
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::any way Grant trades Casspi and gets another 1st rounder?
MemphisSwag::You guys will never see that 1st its between 6-14
YogaBeer::1st rounder as in "Hey you take Casspi and I'll buy the first round."?
ctowngambler78::maybe a 2nd round pick....
HunterF4444::LOL who would be stupid enough to do that?
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::idk, memphis?  Do they need more cap relief? They did just take Leuer. And gave us 2 solid rotational guys
Lugene Parker::Way to represent the Grizzlies Mo and Wayne!  Loved you guys when you were here! Show the East how the West balls out!
YogaBeer::Geesch ESPN.   With all the dog shows you have in your programing you'd think bit.ches would be an accepted word.    Bunch of $@%!$ anyway.
YogaBeer::When Speights came on the floor I yelled to my favorite $@%!$@%, "OH My God!   There's a big guy on the floor and he's doing stuff to those other guys."
Lugene Parker::LOL. He deff carried us last year when Z'Bo was out. He's a player that needed a tough coach and a new environment for him to break out.
MemphisSwag::Cavs are a team I will follow now..
Lugene Parker::Yeah, I want to see how Mo, Wayne and selby progress.
uncle_gct::Nerlens and Thompson duo??
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::you guys need to go check out Isiah Austin out of Baylor. Dude is a beast.
JohnsonnnL::That would be crazy elite shot blocking and rebounding. Cavs would dominate down low
MemphisSwag::Thabust
HunterF4444::Reminds me of Hasheem Thabeet...
uncle_gct::Nerlens can actually move his feet.
elcherino::they're kind of similar, I'm hoping we get a bigger body type like Brook Lopez clone would be perfect imo
HunterF4444::Noel is good defensively but his offense needs a lot of work.
Encaladitos::Lakers game about to start, how is this going to go?
MemphisSwag::They always do EARLY
Encaladitos::They actually look motivated tonight early on.
MemphisSwag::Lakers are the new Bobcats
uncle_gct::Livingston=steal
YogaBeer::He's got hops.   Made Pargo seem irrelevant in a hurry.
MemphisSwag::What happen to Josh Selby?
MemphisSwag::Selby turns the ball over anyway..
YogaBeer::Ooo   I was thinking you can only suit up 13.   So... with a contract that CJ has and Jones just getting back from canton, I figured that was the reason.
elcherino::D-league, Livingston playing too well right now
ctowngambler78::they sent him to the D league.....
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::canton
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::Cavs nbdl team.
MemphisSwag::Thx
nargash::Wasn't cleared to play..!!
YogaBeer::As it currently stands, here's one mock.    And no, at this point, not many mocks pick with need in mind, they are as they seen them go in order they see the talent.  http://nbadraft.net/2013mock_draft
uncle_gct::Only mistake Cavs made in the last few drafts was not trading down for Waiters to get extra picks.
elcherino::yeah waiters is going through some growing pains at times, but still solid pick, drummond would have been the only other guy that would fit our team...but we don't know how things turn out until after a couple of years anyway
YogaBeer::I'm happy at this point with how the draft went last season.    We're at the 1/2 way mark in their rookie seasons.    We'll see how this all plays out.   I rather like our chances with Byron Scott at the helm developing Waiters.    Scott has this track record of developing HOF guards.
elcherino::most of the teams at the top drafted well, we did about the best we could have in the draft, I'm happy to say, since yeah that day I going like WTF?
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::trade downs rarely happen in the nba. this aint the nfl.
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::i heard about that rumor too.
uncle_gct::They already had a deal set
YogaBeer::He wouldn't have been there.
uncle_gct::They already had that deal in place though
YogaBeer::yes... but the Cavs needed a SG in case you all forgot.   This may still end up being the best thing the Cavs did.
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::but........the teams did not need to trade up to get Lilliard. he was there past 6th
uncle_gct::No one thought Waiters would either.  Lillard was a popular ROY pick
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::who was rated the 8-10th best player. No one thought he would produce like he is now.
uncle_gct::Because Damian Lillard was on the board???
clevelandrocksClevelandRocksCLEVELANDROCKS::why would a team trade up for a spot where 5 players could have been picked.
uncle_gct::Yes he would have. Only two spots down
