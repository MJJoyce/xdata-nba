SECiscollegefootball2012::i wish the Hawk never signed Joe Johnson
k80ization::I agree completely, but if he keeps putting up numbers like he has recently on a consistent basis, I can't be too upset.
FingerRoleJoeTM::yeah you're probably right.  But we can always cut him, plus I think Joe is a great player, just over paid...he can still be a top line scorer at any point
SECiscollegefootball2012::2nd most def....He's just not worth the money...he's a good shooter, i just dont think he's on a star level
FingerRoleJoeTM::the 1st time or 2nd time?
FingerRoleJoeTM::This Hawks team could beat anyone in the East... Smooth is playing the best ball of his life and experience for Teague will only make him better, add that with the bench production that this line up has never seen and it is easy to see why this IS NOT YOUR USUAL HAWKS TEAM...keep that in mind
falconsfan0125::its Smoove, not Smooth
CandySparker::Go Jesus Smith!
TC31992::Great Win for Atlanta!!!! On to the Next bOne. Letgo Hawks!!!!!!
G0AT420::hey  theIII24 what site do you use????
gregorio363::I HATE 2 SAY THIS BUT THE HAWKS HAVE NO CHANCE OF WINNING CHAMPIONSHIP WITH CURRENT PLAYERS  GOOD TEAM BUT LETS EITHER MAKE A MOVE OR CHANGE OUR SCHEME 2 RUN AND GUN AND BE ENTERTAINING  5TH TO TENTH BEST TEAM EVERY YEAR BLOWS  RATHER LOSE A LOT WITH CHANCE OF WINNING IT ALL N THE FUTURE
gregorio363::HOPE UR RIGHT
wwsi pprofit::UNDER IN BOSTON GAME187.5 AND UNDER IN MINNY GAME 197.5 LAKERS GAME TOO CLOSE I GOT IT 179 AND THE LINE IS 181

chris paul should be a laker::0-3
ImAllIn0824::take okc, minny, and lal to cover. im thinking, worst can happen is 2 out 3
chris paul should be a laker::0-3
s.molla1993::Lets have a conversation about the Raps vs ATL game rather than pointless nonsense, Am I Right? Great game for the Hawks and an outstanding performance from J-Smoove; 28pts and 15 rebs. Easy win for the Hawks.
chris paul should be a laker::you = idiot
chris paul should be a laker::no al horford or not the raptors are terrible
Braktooth::That's just not true. What they don't have is enough offensive talent in particular.
gregorio363::NBA IS SO WATERED DOWN  AS HAWK FAN I NEED SOME CONFIDENCE IN SOMETHING DOWN THE STRETCH OF A GAME AGAINST A QUALITY OPPONENT  JOE CANT GO 2 THE BASKET LIKE HE USED 2  LIKE 2 SEE TEAGUE BECOME THE MAN---WHY NOT
onthemic79::Well, the Hawks are playing without Horford.  While he may not be a D. Howard type, he's one of our best players.  The other guys stepped up to get the job done.  Great day for Johnson and Smith.
THEIII24::raptors play everyone tough just cant win lol
Braktooth::No Bargnani, they can't score enough. I'm shocked at how much better defensively they are than last year though.
ImAllIn0824::pulled off one against minny though
chris paul should be a laker::hawks struggled against a bad raptors team
gregorio363::CELTS R BEN GAY AND OUT  TAKE THUNDER
k80ization::WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS YELLING?
emil408::thunder -2.5? Celtics have been horrible but they are do for a win
chris paul should be a laker::or one will hog the ball and take most of the shots thus leaving one of them sobbing and bringing the team down
ImAllIn0824::durant and westbrook will score early and often in that one
chris paul should be a laker::statement game for the celtics
ImAllIn0824::everybody was so shocked indiana only layed 3.5 against boston the other day (in indy) exoecting boston to recover. i took indy, easy c-note. trust me celts are BAD
