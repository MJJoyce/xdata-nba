teethmob::just a road block ......lets keep it going .....
tbest23::Will the Bobcats be this bad into 2016 when the Bulls get their 1st rounder regardless? I'm hoping they will be...
xmanfolife::Spurs destroyed the Bobcats.....nobody cares bcuz everybody is destroying the bobcats these days.  Spurs fans shouldn't celebrate
xmanfolife::I understand the coach makes a huge difference on a team but this season is not on Silas.....look what he's working with...overpaid garbage players' that MJ has assembled for him to rocket them to the lottery....just as MJ planned.

Spursdc::Cake
CTthunder860::ultimate hater
white sox rule cubs suck::The Bobcats would lose to a college team.
Carl Withers::thats such a rediculous statement....they are the worst NBA team but would beat any college team by 30
white sox rule cubs suck::The Bobcats are the perfect example of a team that thinks they can.
anonymous_sports_watcher__::beatdown
Spursdc::No way Wilt avg 30 now

anonymous_sports_watcher__::Nice quote by gervin
T-rose724::could see rondo being traded to charlotte for a pick and one of those first round guys
Imkindamajor::so u want bismack and kemba for rondo? and we get to keep our 1st round pick? get it done cho
23germany::rondo is not a basketball player. no team needs a PG that can't shoot  he is lucky to have 3 hall of famers around him
kraidstar::you don't know what you're talking about. rondo's the best player on the team, and they're terrible when he's not on the court..
T-rose724::they have 2 first rounders....of course you are not gonna trade the high pick
Spursdc::another guard?
lopo196::Why would they trade a top 3 pick for Rondo?
lopo196::Are the bobcats a real team?
minick_man83::They would win a few in the D-League
minick_man83::That was a terrible shot by Blair, what was that?
z_man0789::lol
Spursdc::not probably they are, lol
minick_man83::What a great trade to get Lenard.  I know it hasn't really paid off too much yet, but the future is bright for this kid and he brought what the Spurs needed.
anonymous_sports_watcher__::I agree kids got skills
SB47-Locker10::WAIT TILL U SEE HANGA &amp; DAVIS ..  Spurs future along with the new 7-1 290 kid .. Can't remember his name
Spursdc::He is not 290. Also, he is raw and may never make it here. I like Hanga but we might not get him either
minick_man83::I mean he's not lighting it up every night, but is filling a role and will only get better.
Spursdc::cool
Spursdc::It has paid off. Not even missing Hill

Imkindamajor::these nba league pass officials are on spurs nuts
Imkindamajor::no wonder this is FS spurs smh!
Spursdc::rightfully so
Imkindamajor::its all good tho, spurs are a 1 and done in the playoffs
anonymous_sports_watcher__::glad these guys are getting minutes and the starters are getting rest
MadddSammyboy::Charlotte might not win this game.
mystik-eye::They'll make their move at the 4 minute mark and rip the spurs a new one!
mystik-eye::Give em time
MadddSammyboy::Fair enough. If they extend the game by eleven or twelve quarters, the 'Cats have a chance*.  *to lose by 1000 points
Spursdc::Brook Lopez has been putting in work
Spursdc::Lenard
dpeastro::just found out i had as big as feet as tim duncan  but im only 5' 10''
minick_man83::The NBA gave the Spurs a bye tonight.  Why do the Bobcats even play the games anymore?
cowboysspurs20::Charlotte needs a star, and I think that they're going to get one in the next draft.
Imkindamajor::i pray
Spursdc::Draft junkies
Spursdc::Kemba is a joke
tmfaherty::Team needs Tebow
UVA_Guy81::They need Cam Newton.
Spursdc::Kwahi!

anonymous_sports_watcher__::for real
CTthunder860::really
dpeastro::r
anonymous_sports_watcher__::Red Rocket
Spursdc::Tj!
rag63top::Deae Charlotte,  I am aware that the season is not over yet, but I am not sure you are going to make the playoffs.  Taking that into consideration, stop wasting time on the likes of Augustin and start playing Kemba to develop some talent.
anonymous_sports_watcher__::Bench looking good
RL Timbers::The Bobacts are making RJ look like a basketball player.
tmfaherty::let us all pray   Our
Spursdc::The Bobcats don't have one legit starter
frankieII::Hendo is pretty good normally, give him some time back from his injury.
CTthunder860::ya they do and they dont start him , Kemba
Spursdc::bobcats suck
tmfaherty::I have the mortgage bet on SA   Say a prayer
FrankPistachio211::This is simply unacceptable. Easily the Spurs most pathetic performance of the season.
Spursdc::I'm happy we are getting everyone back
Spursdc::I thought Maggot would have had a better career
