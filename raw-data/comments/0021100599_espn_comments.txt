timh651::Ricky Rubio Tears ACL - How Will They Move On? - http://www.WolveSwag.com
LSD_hookem::I feel sorry for DJ Augustin- we he could land with at least a GROWING team!
AndySportsB::THUNDERup
BoomerSooner2844::The bobcats are the worst team i have ever seen....
southridge305::not a fan of okc, but they dont win many games or finals if harden doesnt do what he does. some of u okc fans say he is a 6th man, well if thats the case, then remove okc, bulls, and heat 6th man from their teams and then tell me who u bet on to win that series easily. being a heat fan im going to say haslem is our 6th man and gibson is bulls 6th man andokc say harden is okc 6th man... who u go with in that case... that should tell u how important harden is. okc would be luvky to make it past 5 games against either heat or bulls without harde
Springfresh3::Reading both your comments was a very dizzying experience.  Did you drop out of school when you were 13?
southridge305::lol.  being scary is the last thing i will ever be, especially when it comes to the thunder. u say heat will have to shoot great to win, but the fact is okc will have to play great every game to win. as much as okc score, they give up points more often than the heat do. my statement was the truth, but u just want admit it. u should be happy im on here, i mean with out me you would probably still have 200 messages since not even okc fans chat on here. watch yo westbrook shoot the thunder out a series
KiD_Clutch_in_OKC::What is southridge trying to say?  I got lost in all of his Heat cockgobbling that i dont even know what the point of this post is.  Are u saying Harden shouldnt be 6MOY?  Are u saying Harden is important to OKC?  If thats the case, you might be the stupidest person ive ever had contact with....................OKC KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT HARDEN IS!!!!!!!!!!  And come the Playoffs, your Heat will be fortunate enough to make the post season and experience first hand how important Harden is.  FEAR THE BEARD!!!
T8ke_A_Picture::Shut up!Why a scary Heat fan on our board telling us how the Thunder can't win if this and this. Heat will have to shoot great every game against the Thunder to win.
bringbackthesupersonics::anybody remember jerome james?
leehwgoC::Rank the shooting-guards in the league.  Most people have Wade and Bryant at #1 and #2, of course...  ...and then you have a serious argument for Harden as #3.  It's him or Iguodala, and it's questionable if Iggy still counts as a SG these days.  I love Ginobili, but he's getting long in the tooth and increasingly injury prone, and Harden does as much or more than Johnson or Evans, with less minutes.  And yet Harden is a 6th man on his team.  I doubt there'd even be a question at all that Harden is #3 if he were a starter, and allowed to post 20+ point statlines every game... which he would.  Thunder will be hard pressed to meet other teams' offers for Harden in 2013.  Other franchises will be looking to make him a center-piece.
southridge305::harden isnt a 6th man, he should easily be starting, but okc coach prefer to play him off the bench to provide offense for second unit. he is probably the 5th best shooting guard in the game, behind wade, kobe, iggy, and monta ellis
Springfresh3::That is what makes him the 6th man genius.  When he started for Sefalosha, it didnt click very well.
KiD_Clutch_in_OKC::Actually, before Coach Brooks, Harden prefers to come off the bench.  Harden wanted to, Brooks agreed to let that happen for a bench scoring spark.  You really should stop assuming YOU know whats happening here in OKC and just worry about MIAMI.  50% of your comments about the Thunder are ill-informed.

RollThunder35::Are things going well for your organization when youre trying to decide whether or not to call players on your team the Big 3 or the Big 4?  #dreamscomingtrue
D-Nice891::Are the charlotte bobcats the worst team in NBA history?
ReallyRedAngryBird::Harden is the most underrated player in the league. It's always about Durant and Westbrook and and Harden is giving you 17, 4, 4. It's officially a big 3 now
southridge305::not a fan of okc, but they dont win many games or finals if harden doesnt do what he does. some of u okc fans say he is a 6th man, well if thats the case, then remove okc, bulls, and heat 6th man from their teams and then tell me who u bet on to win that series easily. being a heat fan im going to say  haslem is our 6th man and gibson is bulls 6th man andokc say harden is okc 6th man... who u go with in that case... that should tell u how important harden is. okc would be luvky to make it past 5 games against either heat or bulls without harden
uameany4::The big three is definitely Durant Westbrook Harden
Dented_rim::I thought the Big Three were Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin.  Harden is more valuable than Ibaka. I remember when Thunder fans wanted Jennings and Rubio and Evans and a host of others, they didn't even have Harden on their radar.
ReallyRedAngryBird::Harden would start and possibly make an all star game with other teams. He's the Ginobli of the Thunder
ReallyRedAngryBird::Ibaka is a defensive specialist. Not good enough offensively to be apart of the big 3
Springfresh3::Thats what makes him the Big 3
ReallyRedAngryBird::Who is if not Harden?
Springfresh3::Big 3 is Durant, Westbrook and Ibaka with Harden being the 6th man...but he is far from being underrated...he is on everyones radar
Springfresh3::No he isn't..
tonyssoprano::Great way to start another Long winning Streak at home ! ! !  Thunder UP...................
JabbaWockeeZ_MN::wow.. just saw the highlights, I know it was against the bobcats, but man OKC is good. In a few years I think teams trying to make a big 3 will be at mercy to Oklahoma City Thunder. GL this season.
RollThunder35::And Kevin Love will be vying for an MVP bid.  GL to you.
doggtoyork::THUNDER TURNED DOWN HARDEN AND IBAKA FOR DWIGHT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WE COULD HAVE HAD DWIGHT http://sportsfromlucas.blogspot.com/
RollThunder35::Doggtoyork,  if you actually want that trade, turn your fan card in.  cuz OKC dont want you.
BlakeMoneyball::damn straight
BlakeMoneyball::Dwight could have just left at the end of the season....how do you expect the Thunder to take that risk?
Mr Viz::So apparently there are rumors of Howard possibly signing an extension with the Thunder.
sooner1980wb20::an extension? He isn't even on our team.
Springfresh3::We dont want Howard, our current roster is fine
Mr Viz::If it isnt long term we don't want him. Howard wants a ring and we would surly give it to him if he played for us.
sooner1980wb20::This wouldn't be long term. We would just be renting him. There is no way he signs an extension in OKC, he wants to be in a big market.
Mr Viz::That didn't really help here is a link.  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1097978-nba-rumors-thunder-clinically-insane-to-close-door-on-dwight-howard-trade-offer
Mr Viz::He would be if we traded harden and ibaka. He would only stay for a year though so we said no. Anyway if he agrees to join and sings an extension then we got him.
yale203::good game okc.  but for long term prospects, a swap for westbrook for Mr. j. lin would make perfect sense.
BlakeMoneyball::you are mentally ill
RollThunder35::No thanks yale.
xaionxav::I hope you don't have to get drug tested anytime soon.
workman47::HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
workman47::Can an OKC fan explain to me why Harden doesn't start?
randymossallday::remember its not who starts the game but its who finishes it.
BlakeMoneyball::While he doesn't start, he plays starter minutes.  its just that he can give us scoring when durant and westbrook sit.
leehwgoC::On a different team he would get the same number of minutes as Durant and Westbrook.    He may get "starter minutes" compared to a portion of the league's starters, but he doesn't get "all-star minutes" on the Thunder, and frankly, on 9 out of 10 other teams in the league, he would.  He is literally the third-best shooting-guard in the NBA.
xaionxav::Harden and Collison together on the court equals magic (not the Orlando kind). That's why.
Qzhoopin72::I'm not a Thunder fan but that's easy....they don't need to have all 3 of their big dogs on the court to start the games. Westbrook &amp; Durant are plenty enough, then when they start subbing, they still have at least 2 scoring threats in the game. With a 32-9 record, I'd say it's working just fine.
workman47::k cool that makes sense
doggtoyork::thunder should get howard
xaionxav::I don't think you understand the financial side of basketball.
leehwgoC::OKC is really gonna have to ante up in 2013 to keep Harden on the roster.  As far as I'm concerned, Durant, Westbrook, and Harden qualify as a Big Three.  If Harden was a starter somewhere, he'd routinely post statlines like this one tonight.
Qzhoopin72::You Thunder fans shouldn't worry about lack of comments (Laker fan here)....people know you guys are out there and know that you're an elite NBA title contender. The attention will come!!!!
Qzhoopin72::Here's how you get 5,000 comments real quick..... let the Thunder lose to a lottery team (like the Cavs last night) and let Westbrook take more FG attempts than Durant and shoot 40% doing so....then there's your recipe for 5,000 comments!!!
AItheAnswer0001::Westbrook is having a great season, he has some areas in need of improvement but people who complain about a guy playing at that level don't know much about the game.
crimson-knights123::nah its alright, we dont want trolls
leehwgoC::Yeah, seriously.  The only real reason Lakers and Heat threads, etc., get so many more posts is because literally 70-80% of those posts are trolls or people responding to trolls.
southridge305::havent even reach 300 comments yet and 10 have came from me alone.lol, yet i still see thunder fan on heat page
tonyssoprano::You are VERY WELCOME LOSER....Heat got Lucky tonight Fool and you know it...DWAYNE had to save the day for your little mvp Lechoke.....LMAO....
soonerfan150::I'll contribute!
sooner1980wb20::Only 44 to go... we'll get there
Lakurland::This franchise does not even deserve to be an NBA team. Selig needs to delete them from the league, go back to 29.
leehwgoC::Btw, if Lakurland had his way, the Thunder, Clips, Mavs, and  Spurs would all be 'deleted' from the league.  You know, basically everyone he's afraid would destroy LA this season in a 7-game series.
leehwgoC::Selig?  lol.  Figures it's a Lakers fan posting this.   Anyway, it's Seattle's fault the franchise had to move.
soonerfan150::We got a smart guy here!
Mr Viz::What team are you talking about?
Lakurland::Actually, move them back to Seattle, but keep jordan in Charlotte.
_tjc44_::uh don't you mean David Stern? Selig is the commish of baseball.
_tjc44_::I don't know about you, but I was personally shocked at the final score.
Qzhoopin72::NBA's "All Los Angeles" team; C - Tyson Chandler F - Paul Pierce F - Tayshaun Prince G - Russell Westbrook G - Arron Afflalo 6th Man - James Harden
Qzhoopin72::Rookie of the Year:  Derrick Williams
Qzhoopin72::Forgot about Andre Miller too!!
Qzhoopin72::Yeah....just thinking of guys that played HS ball in Los Angeles....the other forwards on my list were Trevor Ariza, Craig Smith, Amir Johnson &amp; Dorrell Wright.
Qzhoopin72::Harden as 6th man only because that's what he does....there's still guys like DeMar DeRozan, Brandon Jennings, Nick Young, Jordan Farmar, Baron Davis, that didn't make the LA cut!!
sooner1980wb20::O I didn't know that was the criteria... he was born in LA, but he went to HS in Phx
Qzhoopin72::He didn't go to high school in LA as I recall.
sooner1980wb20::And Richard Jefferson
sooner1980wb20::Afflalo over Harden is a subject of debate.
GV Black::And lack of comments meaning no respect?  Not really.   OKC has a good fan base for the most part without a ton of stupidity (for the most part).  So the fan base doesnt get alot of hate.
southridge305::whatever, watch when okc play heat, your board will have lots of messages, even when okc lose
GV Black::True.  There was alot more action with the Cavs last night because the game was close, people love to bash Cavs Fan, and they got to get all over OKC for losing.  There was nothing to bash tonight.
dur4twant::and also, the lack of comments is because of the bobcats, not okc... thank you sir.
comedy2424::James Harden on FSN OK was talking about the win and his 33 point game. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWAKQCdGY3o&amp;feature=channel the thunder are getting $@%!$@% stronger and stronger
GV Black::After last night, I'm surprised CHA kept it this close.   OKC didnt know about Kyrie Irving or Alonzo GEE, and they forgot about Antawn Jamison long ago.  CHA was doomed.
timetodienow123::DJ Augustin to the Lakers for expiring contracts and 2 1st rounders.
southridge305::i see all the thunder fans on heat board talking trash about how the refs gave heat the game.. hoow pathetic u have 227 messages and this is nothing new. nobody really cares about okc
RDavison82::Florida sucks.  The requirement to live there is be over the age of 65 or float over illegally on a inner tube. Just has many rednecks there as anywhere else lol.
GV Black::LeBron who?
southridge305::i just came to prove a point and i clearly did, u have 300 messages if that, yet your fans on heat board still saying lebron not this or that when he clearly hit clutch shotsand played great defense.
dur4twant::and also, why are you here then if ur not a thunder fan... gtfo.
GV Black::I'm a Cavs Fan, but I like folowing the Thunder because the Cavs are working on becoming the Thunder-East.  Can I be here?
dur4twant::$@%!$@% no one cares about the bobcats not okc...
sooner1980wb20::Why do we only have 219 comments??? Do people not know we are the top team in the West?
tulsahurricane0530::I like oklahoma. one of the cheapest places to live. plenty of things to do. they weather is the only downfall, always so windy
RDavison82::Thunder up where you from? Oklahoma isn't bankrupt and we have extremely low unemployment rates along with all the oil and natural gas so suck it $@% ok&gt;you
dur4twant::bobcats fans dont exist lol
sooner1980wb20::we deserve more respect than this
thunderup253::except for the thunder oklahoma sucks .... birds fly upside down when in oklahoma cuz its not even worth shi%%ing on
sooner1980wb20::Well this isn't a discover Oklahoma message board... we are talking about the Thunder dumb@$$
Barrk1::No one lives in Oklahoma?
sooner1980wb20::we sold out our game tonight... more than 18K people
SportMasterB::OKC so good that people don't have time to post on these boards, we can only watch them demolish their opposition.
sooner1980wb20::that's the only logical conclusion

crimson-knights123::where the trolls now?
sooner1980wb20::The Jets management just gave their fans the middle finger by extending Sanchez.
Springfresh3::LOL, Ryan going for broke
84Goldfinger007::Jets board.......
sooner1980wb20::on the Heat/Pacers board
Qzhoopin72::Uh oh....Skip Bayless is gonna trash Westbrook again!! He took more shots than Durant....doesn't matter that they won by 500 points!!!
AItheAnswer0001::The problem is that when Westbrook scores, it's not as devastating as when Durant does. Skip Bayless is clueless more often than not.
Qzhoopin72::I'm hoping Skip will have Westbrook in studio across the table when that day comes!!
Pinkycuh::If I was Westbrook,  I would be like, you second rate clown, I will never be on your show, eat a D!
Springfresh3::When Thunder win the title, the first person I'm checking on is Skippy
Qzhoopin72::I think Skip is slowly but surely becoming convinced that OKC needs more than just one scoring threat on the floor. It damn sure ain't gonna be Perkins or Cook....and when Harden isn't on the floor, it has to be Westbrook. So what if he's the point guard??
Springfresh3::Come out of the closet
SportMasterB::And what if Westbrook gets finals mvp.... Skip Bayless might just _______.
somaliangangsterpufff::damn I picked the bobcats.starting to think that they wont even make the playoffs this year
KevinDurantFan56::?!?!??? There 5-34
SportMasterB::People who said OKC has no bench, they scored 60.
Springfresh3::James Sparden   33 pts shooting  11-17 and 4-9 3pts
lspat1980::It's so weird that the Greatest Player to ever Play (Jordan) is the Worst GM in the NBA today.
SportMasterB::No he's the best GM, he's obviously tanking the season for Luck. Wait.....
sooner1980wb20::That kid from UK is pretty good.... but he is no Kwame Brown
somaliangangsterpufff::wait............mj's the bobcats gm?!?
Qzhoopin72::As Max Kellerman best said it, "Michel Jordan is the Michael Jordan of bad owners!!"
KevinDurantFan56::LOL Does Jordan even go to their games anymore?
lspat1980::It's funny how Byron Mullens was 4th String Center for OKC, and now he's a key Contributor for Charlotte. lol

StompYourFace25::we are so bad
Springfresh3::MJ spotted leaving through the service entrance hallway

BumSandlers::Who is Hard-On
84Goldfinger007::OKC probably really angry for the loss yesterday........  How in the ^*&amp;^*&amp; did they even lose in the first place??
Carslon12::Go Cavs!!!
KevinDurantFan56::Free Throws + Rebounds+ Turnovers
KevinDurantFan56::Harden for 3 point Contest Next Year!!!
Jordsta4Life::defintely
Carslon12::Go Cavs!!!

Carslon12::no , this is a lottery ball year....the western seeds are just practice fodder
Springfresh3::Throw it in the bag, this game is done
_CelticThunder_350_::Durant+Westbrook+Harden=23/33 shooting, 63 points, 6 boards, 9 assists.
_CelticThunder_350_::Yes, I'm a fan of both teams.

yale203::If offered the chance, would you swap Westbrook for Lin ?
Springfresh3::Lin belongs on the Lakers
_CelticThunder_350_::No. Lin has only played a handful of games, and while he's good, you're comparing him to a 24 ppg guy.
