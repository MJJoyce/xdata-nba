Alvordton::Warrior fan and happy for the win but it will mean more if we do it when Marc Gasol is on the floor. His absence taints this victory slightly. In a best of seven series, one victory is not enough of a stake in the heart,
Steven McCormick::Every time Draymond Green gets into the game he gives the other team foul shots . . . . how the heck  did this guy play for Michigan State???  He's lousy.
THE REAL DWIGHT::golden state wins it
CSONKA_39::Curry is on fire!!
dster20::GSW will bounce back. But this win 2 lose 2 deal needs to change.
Aktion Pak::what's happening to the grizzlies they don't look like a playoff team now talk about back to back blowout losses at home
weird "h"::Is Curry Planning to play for the whole 48 minutes today?
dster20::Thompson hot and cold. Ride him while he's hot until the put a real defender on him. Go GWS. Tag team, Curry takes over 2nd half.
timeout::If you don't beat the teethless bears, please don't call yourselves the Warriors.
Seattle Blows!::dubs need to attack the hoop, Marc is injured.
