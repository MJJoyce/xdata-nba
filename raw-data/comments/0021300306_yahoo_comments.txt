Anton::Ugly game...Wizards are improving and they will make the playoffs. Huge win for Nuggets with Ty out.
Bob::Hopfully Mcgee is paying attention on the bench and figuring out how to play against some of these tougher teams.
CSONKA_39::Who's the stupid coach for the Nuggets that gives Foye more minutes than Nate?
PKM::If Lawson can play then he and Wall should be a good matchup.
fup duck::if Beal and Nene get healthy, Gortat's prediction might not be so far off the Wall
CSONKA_39::Little Nate to the rescue!
Cyril::I know both these teams are missing their leading scorers, but the offense in this game is horrible.  Looks like a college score.
Tony Anthony::John Wall is taking over!!
Amir::Wiz bench 2-13 kills us again.
Munkhsaikhan::Arizaaaa nooooooooooooooooooo
