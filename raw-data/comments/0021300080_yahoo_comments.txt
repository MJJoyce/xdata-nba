Busy cutting crap::He's starting to show some low-post moves; he hit a couple of those KG/Dirk fadeaways on the baseline, and he's shown that little hook move a few times here this season as well. But I agree; if he continues to add to his post game, he could lead the league in scoring every year- he gets so many easy points from offensive rebounds (and passes from Rubio), plus his outside shooting, that if he had the post game as well he would LITERALLY be unstoppable.
raymond::t-wolves got the wrong spainard, should have jose calderon who is twice the player that rubio is. who was the brain that picked shabazz? another first round turd dropped on the team by management. i thought they fired kahn, at the next draft have a monkey pick a name out of a hat
LeonLeroy::Loves the man.  I built both of my fantasy teams around him.  Really hope the Bulls can get him at some point.
Mister E::The Wolves are going to be dangerous this year, and Love is a darkhorse for MVP
D::Kevin Love could put up monster numbers this year
Anton::If the T'Wolves have a strong PG they would be contenders for real. K-Love is playing like an MVP, Martin is scoring at will, Peko is big, Brewer defends and hits, Rubio just shampoos his hair.
- LJ::k love for MVP
Long Duck Dong::Dirl Blowitski is finished.  i said this after his poor performance last year.  this year is starting out like last year ended.  good thing the mavs picked up ellis, otherwise they would be 0-6.
Dan::Great game by the Wolves. If Rubio could ever pull his head out of his #$%$ this team could make a serious run.   Wolves!
You Don'T Know, Bo Knows::Love...stud.  Kevin Marting...off season pick up of the year.  Corey Brewer...another genius move by Flip.  Go Wolves.
