Dented_rim::Are the Thunder ever going to get a following? This team should average 1000 posts a game from their fan base...gawd, forbid they have several losing seasons.
marcpru60::there is a rumor floating around that golden state used to be a real basketball team... ah, but it alludes to over three decades ago so does that make it true or is that too far back to count?
neuroman::In the NBA you cannot win consistenly without the players. There are no "49ers" in the NBA, where the team looks less talented but can be coached up. The Warriors need a post scorer and a 2 guard that can play defense and they are a long way away from having that. Most of their drafts have been decent considering where they have picked. Unfortunately they never get lucky in the lottery and haven't been high in the drafts with can't miss players like Rose available. The Warriors are better off trading Ellis for picks and young players and sucking for a couple of years to rebuild. There just isn't the talent base there right now to do much more than scrape out a 7 or 8 seed, even if everything goes well.
Oaktown1029::Why are you listening to rumors that are over 30 years old?
brandonlee561heat::Anyone know how long Westbrook is out for?
Michelle Beadles Mustache Hair::I bet a lot of folks are happy Westbrook is injured
RyanCarranza::Judging by the lack of responses to anything on this board... Totally...
Cinnasnootzer::Another season of the same from "Golden State" i.e. Oakland.  When does the new coach get hired, holding a press confrence and talking about defense and playing the game the right way?
brob715::I cringed when both Westbrook and Ellis went down. I'm glad OKC got the win and I really hope both injuries were very minor. Ellis is a terrific player to watch and I wish the best for him to be healthy. Reports early on Westbrook were a mild sprain, crossing my fingers that it was very minor.
BEARS34995::westbrooks is a terrribe pg sucks hes out but never should hacve extended  the contract hes a selfish N and wont work with durant good luck OKC
ksanders6::.........and we have ourselves another Skip Bayless
NBA_refs_are_weak::hes not selfish, its not a matter of that. he doesnt choose in his head like you know what, this game im chucking up 25 shots i dont give a $@%!. hes a great scorer, it comes natural to him. what he needs to do is take that, and build on it with passing. its an art form that takes years to develop. steve nash wasnt the guy you watch now when he first entered the league. he worked on that craft season after season. its not black and white, either he wants to pass or not. its just development and progress. hes young. the more important part really is the mental  side, does he WANT to become a better player, and anytime ive heard him talk I think he does. so let him go. dont just throw out the word selfish
ChilamBilam12::Westbrook is leading all PG's in scoring, and is putting up career highs in rebounding and steals.. assists are not really an issue with a team that picks up most of its offense from Iso plays and jump shooting, an issue that has been discussed to a stand still already and obviously is not effecting the leagues 3rd best offense.. again Durant was a two time scoring champion because of Westbrook and not in spite of him, it is time for people to get off the kid, he is one of the best players in the game right now and has only been playing the PG position for 3 years since entering the NBA (not an easy task for any athlete)
thedude0612::Next time use english please
hawks_mvp::As an Atlanta fan I can not wait to see a team back in Seattle.  Watching this team in their $@%!$@%! jerseys is just pathetic.  Please stay in real cities NBA.
ksanders6::This is a very dumb *ss statement, I dont understand how Okc is not a real city,......hawks_mvp,......slap yourself....smdh. Oklahoma gets no love.
RADSportsFan::Sounds like someone is jealous that their team isn't as good as OKC......
thedude0612::I'm curious, what criteria does a place have to meet to be a "real city"? OKC certainly exists, therefore it is a real city.
WIkalikalou::Geez....an Atlanta fan bashing a city for a sports team? Shouldn't you be working on losing your 3rd hockey team?
unNOOBable::i guess when its all said and done, WestBrick is a 20-5-5 player who shoots 46% .. could be worse. they could have derek fisher's 5-3-0 per night 40 year old legs.
rolltide4204::a 6 3 guy who shoots 18 times a game shooting 47 percent is great imo.. and he has shot over 50 percent in 10 of the last 13 games. In the games he didnt he was very close. Right now hes scoring as good as nyone in the league. U forget durant has always been a 45-46 percent shooter. No other pg in the league id rather have than wbrook. top 5 player in the nba
rolltide4204::more like a 23-24  6 and 5 player for this year.. most years he will average 8 or so assists like he did the last 2 years. Hes actually become a great shooter- one of the best players in the league easily
slugger457::Russell Westbrook has just passed away at an Oklahoma City hospital from a reaction to the drug Penatral. So sad
rolltide4204::Yeah hope he will be back.. but thats 3 starters and a backup pg hurt now
jembree44::I hope so ,  But if he needs the rest we should be able to beat the nuggets without him..They have lost like 6 games in a row since Galinari got hurt.
rolltide4204::so it cant be to bad? U think he will play sunday night?
jembree44::ESPN said he was walking without a limp after the game....Slugger go back to your Mamas Trailor and go to bed.....
RollThunder35::Idiot.
rolltide4204::shutup
rolltide4204::do u know anything about if hes okay?
5baker05::how bad is westbrooks injury!
rolltide4204::Man I sure hope not bad. This will completely ruin their season
Jun360::Dreams of championships are as fragile as ankle sprains from two players basically , coz everyone else on this squad won't be able to fill the gap !
RollThunder35::Thunder and Heat scores virtually identical.
