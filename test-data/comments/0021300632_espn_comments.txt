Brett Reid::im not a blazer fan , nor am i a clipper fan. But how blake Griffin is starting over Lamarcus aldridge  is wrong on epic proportions. Griffin has hops yes. but zero post game, his shooting is mediocre at best. his defence isn't that great either. L.A is having a career year and this is how he gets treated. its such a shame.
Meron Foto::To be fair..... Griffin post game has improved a lot this year when compared to last year or before.   But overall skills---- def LA. But hey..... fans are voting so what do you expect? lol
Jeffrey Nicholas::Much of your statement is well out of date at this point. Griffin has grown and is certainly not a one dimensional player any more. I don't know how people can take it seriously enough to complain when Kobe gets in.
Brandon Tigues::griffin's been playing great this year, he improved his post game and his mid range shot..I don't know how often you've seen him play but he's looked real good, but with that said I do agree..Portland has a better record than the clippers partly due to Aldridge and he's putting up better numbers.
Eric Johnson::Blazers should win this one by double digits. Big help with a couple days off and the energy at the Moda center.
Chris Mijares::I love the sports media elite.  When a lesser team or player is successful early in the season, the talking heads say it doesn't matter.  If it's one the league's designated star teams or players, though, they just fawn on and on.  No worries, I love what my Blazers have done so far, and I'm cautiously optimistic about the playoffs.
Leland Wong::Based on what Stephen A Smith have said, this is a fluke, the Blazers will fall back down.
Bimal Pall::Leland Wong And everyone knows Stephen A Smith is a moron!
Louis James Flores::Stephen a smith...is this guy just a mouth or has he actually done anything in his life....whenever he's on TV, I turn it because he's aweful.
Jonathan Allen Kiser::Also, you can't really "stop" them. They are a very balanced team. Portland can score, but Houston and Durant just could not miss anything these last few games..
Adam Youman::the thunder stopped them. held em to under 100
Kevin Walker::Adam Youman are you ever not on espns portland coverage talking about them?
Adam Youman::Kevin Walker nope. never. i am omnicient
Richard Thaxton::It is time for teams like Portland, Warriors and Thunder to win a title, 37, 39 and 34 years are too long.
Ryan van den Meerendonk::thunder have never won a title. and don't give me seattle, there are no sonics anymore.
Andrew Lipham::terrible officiating.  horribly biased in favor of the blazers late in this game.
Jeffrey Nicholas::I disagree as a neutral observer.
Andrew Lipham::Jeffrey Nicholas 2 pathetic foul calls vs denver under 2 minutes to go in the game leading to 4 blazer gimme free throws.
Jeffrey Nicholas::Andrew Lipham I thought they were correct calls.
Ryan Duke Tait::This should be a game to help get the Blazers get off the schneid.
David Solso::Nice to see some non Blazer fans realize LA is the better PF. I agree that Griffins overall game has improved, and he puts up good #s, but he is not as polished as LA. Inside-outside, Aldridge has a very rounded game, when you former and current nba stars saying he should be a starter and or hes the best PF in the game, to me that speaks volumes. Maybe next year he can get the votes.
Eric Johnson::Blazers never throw in the towel. So bet on this game being a grinder with a 32nd win for the Blazers on the season. Go blazers!
Ayn Bland::Grinder?  This implies defense.  DOES NOT COMPUTE!
Eric Johnson::Ehh, an offensive  grinder
Adam Youman::lol ^ an honest fan
Ayn Bland::Looks like Denver came to play.  And there's so much...oxygen...in that Portland air!
MaLi Uner::How come either Lillard or Aldridge is not starting for the allstar game, not fair! I am not a Blazers fan.
Isaiah Parrish::Surprise team of the year. There elites in the much talented western confrence
Marcleen Bavogui::uh NO.. the suprise team is phoenix
Isaiah Parrish::uh YES.. Nobody at the start of the season would've guessed Portland would be contending for the top spot in the west. Phoenix is a surprise but not as big as Portland.
Marcleen Bavogui::Isaiah Parrish uh nobody saw  them contending for the top  spot sure.. i will give u that... but we saw them making the playoffs.. nobody saw phoenix winning 20 games before the season.. yet alone being in the playoffs mix.. so i will say they`re a bigger suprise then portland.
Jake Conley::Nuggets are screwed. RipCity ain't dropping another one for a while.
Adam Youman::they are if they leave teams open on the 3 point line all game
Steve Broome::Trying to remember if I've seen Portland play good D all year.
Chad Wiggins::lol at the trail blazers.... guess this is goodbye
Rodney Sargent::Brian shaw just isn't a good coach
Brett Reid::first time being head coach, give him time to work out the jittters, he was under jackson, im sure he'll do fine wants he gets into his on groove.
Brett Reid::but if you wish to really know who is awful head coach, that would be Mike Brown, The cav's stacked their team for lebron and mike still couldnt deliver, forcing cleveland to lose their best player ever.  then mike waltzed his way over to the lakers and completely imploded a team that had the talent to be great, The lakers are still picking up the pieces of his reign. To top it all off, Cav's management for some silly reason decided to hire Mike again.. and what happened.. in my eyes the cavs are the biggest joke this season. they are stacked with offensive talent and they can't score.
Adam Youman::Brett Reid the cavs are stacked with offensive talent yes but they dont play as a team. i watch either kyrie or waiters dribble up the floor and shoot. and any big man (thompson, varejao, clark) who even touches the ball looks to shoot it asap because he knows that may be the last time he gets the ball
Matt Dysarz::this board is dead
Meron Foto::Every NBA board is dead compared to NFL....... I can seriously hear crickets.
Shawn Petrozziello::It's just sad that DaMarcus Aldridge and this Blazer team overall still aren't getting their due. Blake Griffin being named a starter over him is a joke. For me Aldridge is only behind Durant, Paul George, and LeBron for MVP. Blake Griffin isn't a top 15 player, maybe not even top 20.
Adam Youman::he is probably a top 15 player actually. rebounds, points, efficiency...and the reason he is in the all star game is because people like watching him dunk. its more fun to see that than watch LA post someone up at mid range and turn around and shoot. the all star game is not about talent it is about the flashy players. LA just isnt flashy
Jeffrey Nicholas::Adam Youman The NBA has so many really good players right now, but it really feels like there should be more transcendent talents than there are. My first reaction is that Griffin is nowhere near top 15, but then I realized after the top 5 or so you could honestly make a case for anywhere between 5 and 20 for a ton of guys.
Matthew L Smith::ESPN...how is Randy Foye your top performer for Denver. He scored 14 points with 3 rebs and 5 asts but was a minus 12 while on the court. I would have thought Lawson with a double double of 13 and 11 and 2 steals and a plus 1 while on the court would have been more deserving.
Adam Youman::there is a formula called "Hollinger Game Score" that was designed by hollinger to rate each player's performance on a nightly basis. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hollinger here is a link as to how they determine the best performer on each team every individual night.
Eric Witt::This 9-0 stretch the Blazers are on right now is exactly why I get frustrated with how bad the Blazers play D. They are very capable of locking down on teams, the effort and rotations just aren't always there. No way this unit should give up 103 points a game!
Adam Youman::it seems like they wait till the end of the games to play defense so they dont tire out or something....very strange method and only works if you can stay hot on offense. its pretty much the reason they have so many close games...im starting to think its by design
Louis James Flores::I really hope the Blazers won't let this one go in the last few minutes like the OKC game...they SHOULD win this one but Denver can score points.  I expect Hickson and Dre  to play good....if Dre gets in much...he'll try to school Lillard.
Meron Foto::Blazers are 10-0 when holding opponents under 100 points.   If they can play average defense....... they would be hard to stop since their offense is consistent.
Adam Youman::not this game. i did say at the beginning if nuggets get hot from 3-pt they are unstoppable...just ask OKC lol they lit em up
Meron Foto::Adam Youman Naaa---- Durant lit'em up,...... pretty much nothing you can do when he is feelin it.
Adam Youman::Meron Foto the thunder lost to the nugs when they went off in the first half shooting similarly to how they played the first half of this game. durant had 30 points only lol the thunder scored 88 points. that was back when durant was the only one who could score for the thunder with RW out tho
Trevor Scott Alexander::Chalk another one up for Portland. Haters are going to do what they do all the way until the Blazers make the finals. This team is good and is getting better.
Matt Dysarz::The thought is this team has very little on the bench,  starters a very good but this team is one injury away from falling.  They will fade in the playoffs from wearing out without a deep bench,  need to add a few quality bench guys.
Matt Dysarz::Portland's starters lead the league in min played per game.  Bench plays the fewest min
Adam Youman::problem with the playoffs: the best teams (okc spurs clippers) who play defense will realize very quickly that they just need to stop LA. once they figure that out it wont be too difficult to bring down the blazers
Sean Blaser::I can see both lillard and aldridge going off tonight there both probably pissed that they didnt get picked as starters for the all star game
Brett Reid::Blazers trying everything to lose this game, how many chances did they just have to put it away, now gotta pray denver misses
