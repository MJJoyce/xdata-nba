 THE FACT:  The Blazers, who make more 3-point shots than any team in the NBA (10.1 per game), won despite going only 4-for-18 from beyond the arc -- their second-lowest output of the season. 
 
 THE LEAD: LaMarcus Aldridge  scored 30 of his career-high 44 points in the second half -- including Portland's final 15 of the game -- to give the Trail Blazers a 110-105 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night at the Moda Center. The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for the Blazers (32-11), who had dropped the final two games of their recent four-game road trip. 
 
 Wesley Matthews  scored 18 of his 24 points in the first half for Portland, which held Denver to 38 points in the second half and only 14 in the fourth quarter.  Wilson Chandler  led six players in double figures with 18 points for the Nuggets (20-21), who lost their third straight game. 
 
 QUOTABLE:  "L.A. is the best power forward in the league. I don't know why he's not starting in the All-Star Game."  
 -- Blazers forward  Nicolas Batum  on Aldridge 
 
 
 THE STAT:  Aldridge became the first player with at least 44 points, 13 rebounds, five assists and two blocks since the Nets' Vince Carter in April 2007. 
 
 TURNING POINT:   Randy Foye  made a running layup with 1:01 left to give Denver its last lead at 105-104. The Nuggets went 0-for-4 the rest of the way, the Blazers scoring their final six points on Aldridge free throws. 
 
 HOT:  After starting the game 1-for-7, Aldridge went 14-for-22 the rest of the way. 
 
 NOT:  After shooting .585 in the first half, Denver cooled to .392 over the final two periods. 
 
 QUOTABLE II:  "The buckets Aldridge made, I can live with that. But some of the fouls we committed -- just sending him to the line without him really having to work for it -- hurt us, especially in the fourth quarter." 
 -- Nuggets coach  Brian Shaw  on Aldridge, who was 15-for-29 from the field and 14-for-17 from the foul line 
 
 
 GOOD MOVE:  Blazers coach  Terry Stotts  used the 6-foot-8 Batum to guard the Nuggets' 5-11  Ty Lawson  through much of the second half. Lawson was blanked after scoring 13 points in the first half. 
 
 BAD MOVE:  Shaw rarely chose to double-team Aldridge through the game. The ploy didn't work. 
 
 QUOTABLE III:  "It was nothing about that. We had lost two games. We just needed this one." 
 --  LaMarcus Aldridge , denying not being named as a starter in the All-Star Game provided extra motivation 
 
 
 NEXT:  For the Nuggets, Saturday vs. Indiana, Sunday @ Sacramento, Wednesday vs. L.A. Charlotte. For the Trail Blazers, Saturday vs. Minnesota, Sunday @ Golden State, Tuesday vs. Memphis.
