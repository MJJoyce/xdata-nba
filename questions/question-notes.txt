Question 3:
----
Trades can be identified with provided helper script. Requires a player Id to be
    provided
Injuries can be viewed over the entire dataset per player. Helper script
    provides "confirmed" injury queries in addition to "possible" injury
    queries.
Potential firing information can be discovered with free text search over game
    commentary and comments. There tends to be a lot of noise in this
    information (past firings being discussed in game recaps or people demanding
    firings in comments)
Personnel changes: Unsure how to handle

Question 13:
----
Streaks can be identified with provided helper script. Requires a game id to be
    provided.

Unstructured data doesn't offer a ton of use. Occasional mention of streaks can
    be found in game recap information with free text searches. Comment data
    tends to be flooded with win/loss streak discussion as opposed to scoring
    streak comments.
